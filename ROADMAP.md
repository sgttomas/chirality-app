# Roadmap (v2.0.0 â†’)

Focused plan to evolve chiralityâ€‘app beyond foundation mode while keeping the codebase lean and coherent.

## Recently Shipped (v2.0.0)
- Canonical 11â€‘station pipeline with foundation mode (S1â€“S5 + S11)
- Modeâ€‘aware orchestrator and dependency validator (warnâ€‘only)
- Packet schema + exporter (`runs/<runId>/run.json`, `packets.jsonl`)
- REST API (`/api/pipeline/traverse`, `/api/export/run`) and minimal UI
- CI with AJV schema validation and legacy sweep

## Nearâ€‘Term (next 4â€“6 weeks)
- Stations S6â€“S10: Implement real iteration/refinement logic and payloads
- Tighten schema: stationâ†’operation mapping via JSON Schema `if/then`
- Dependency validator: move from warnâ€‘only to hard enforcement
- UI: Export viewer (show `run.json` summary, download button, packet list)
- Export API (optional): add `/api/export/download?runId=...` to stream a ZIP
- Fallback hardening: add `LLMService { disabled: true }` in fallback to avoid any network attempt in CI/dev
- Tests: unit tests for fallback traversal producing valid packets; strict validator tests

## Mediumâ€‘Term (2â€“3 months)
- Fullâ€‘mode semantics: complete S1â€“S11 with convergence criteria for iterations
- Matrix ingestion (optional): wire `lib/framework` seeds into S1â€“S5 prompts
- Multiâ€‘run management: list/rm endpoints, housekeeping for `runs/`
- Access control (optional): RBAC guard for export/download endpoints
- Observability: standardize timings, station token usage, and structured logs
- DX: CLI script to validate a run (`node scripts/validate-run.js <runId>`) using AJV
- Config: envâ€‘driven LLM parameters (temperature, tokens) and model flags

## Longâ€‘Term
- Golden snapshot tests for stations and exports across sample problems
- Optional graph integration behind a feature flag; keep core graphâ€‘free
- Plugin surface for domainâ€‘specific station logic and prompts

## Documentation
- Keep README/INTERFACE/API_REFERENCE canonical and in sync with code
- Update ARCHITECTURE as S6â€“S10 semantics land
- Maintain MIGRATION notes for any breaking API/schema changes

## Success Criteria
- Foundation and full modes produce schemaâ€‘valid packets deterministically
- UI provides a clear, downloadable export with packet introspection
- CI blocks on schema/validator failures and legacy regressions
- Code remains small, explicit, and easy to reason about
