## 7. Decisions Captured

The following decisions were made during the decomposition process.

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| DEC-01 | Packages organized by discipline (not by facility/area or work phase) | Easiest for humans to understand in this context; aligns with engineering deliverable organization |
| DEC-02 | Deliverables organized by document type within each package | Reflects engineering documentation as the primary artifacts; provides type consistency within each deliverable |
| DEC-03 | Site Establishment as separate package (PKG-00) | Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works |
| DEC-04 | Berth 10 upgrades and repairs itemized as separate scope item | Clarification from user that existing infrastructure work should be explicit |
| DEC-05 | Terminal network interfaces treated as multiple distinct systems | CCTV, access control, communications are separate systems with distinct interfaces |
| DEC-06 | MCC building equipment installed on-site after building erection | Clarification from user on installation sequence |
| DEC-07 | Nitrogen skid connection only in Contractor scope (skid supplied by Employer) | Confirmed interface boundary per user clarification |
| DEC-08 | Progress photographs excluded from scope (construction management) | User clarification that this is not a documentation deliverable |
