**Deliverable Artifacts:** Illumination test records *(Source: _CONTEXT.md, Decomposition)*

**Inclusions:**
- Installation inspection records and checklists
- Illumination level test results (exterior and interior)
- Emergency lighting test records (illuminance and duration)
- Control system functional test records
- Punch list and final acceptance documentation

**Exclusions:**
- Electrical power distribution testing (see PKG-17)
- Control system integration testing (see PKG-19; coordinate with lighting controls testing)

- Installation checklists shall verify mounting, alignment, wiring, grounding — **ASSUMPTION**

**FR-2: Illumination Testing**
- Field illuminance measurements shall be conducted for all exterior and interior areas — **ASSUMPTION**
- Test grid and locations shall align with calculation grids from DEL-18.03 where practical — **ASSUMPTION**
- Measured illuminance compared to calculated values; acceptance criteria typically ≥80% of calculated — **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**

**FR-3: Emergency Lighting Testing**
- Emergency illuminance testing shall verify minimum 10 lux average, 1 lux minimum per NFPA 101 — **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**
- Duration testing shall verify minimum 90-minute battery backup operation per NFPA 101 — **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**

**FR-4: Control System Functional Testing**
- All lighting controls shall be functionally tested (sensors, switches, integration) — **ASSUMPTION**
- Control zones shall operate as designed — **ASSUMPTION**

### Performance Requirements

**PR-1: Illuminance Acceptance Criteria**
- Measured average illuminance ≥ required levels per ER and codes — **TBD**
- Measured minimum illuminance ≥ 80% of calculated minimum (typical tolerance) — **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**
