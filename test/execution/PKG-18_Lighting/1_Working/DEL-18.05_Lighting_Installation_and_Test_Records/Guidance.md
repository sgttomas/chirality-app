# Guidance: DEL-18.05 Lighting Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

**Deliverable Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for lighting. *(Source: _CONTEXT.md)*

**Role in Project:** These installation and test records demonstrate that the lighting system is properly installed, performs as designed, and meets all requirements. Essential for:
- Project closeout and final acceptance
- Warranty activation
- Operations and maintenance baseline
- Regulatory compliance documentation

**Deliverable Classification:** Type: Record | Discipline: Electrical | Responsible: D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Principles

**P-1: Testing Verifies Design**
- Field illuminance testing verifies calculations (DEL-18.03) are accurate
- Deviations from calculated values may indicate installation issues (fixture aiming, dirt, lamp output) or calculation assumptions (reflectances, obstructions)

**P-2: Emergency Lighting is Safety-Critical**
- NFPA 101 emergency lighting testing is code-required and life-safety-critical
- Duration testing (90 minutes) must be conducted to ensure battery backup meets code requirements
- Test annually thereafter per code

**P-3: Documentation Quality**
- Complete, accurate records essential for acceptance and closeout
- Signatures and witness verification provide accountability
- Photographs and as-built markups document actual installed conditions

## Considerations

**C-1: Testing Timing**
- Exterior illuminance testing conducted at night when dark
- Interior testing can be conducted anytime (close doors/windows to block daylight if needed)
- Schedule testing when installation is substantially complete to avoid rework

**C-2: Test Equipment**
- Illuminance meters (lux meters) must be calibrated within 12 months
- Cosine-corrected sensors provide accurate readings
- Multiple measurements per location and averaging reduces error

**C-3: Acceptance Criteria**
- Measured illuminance typically 80-100% of calculated values (some tolerance for real-world conditions)
- If measured values significantly low, investigate causes (fixture aiming, dirt, lamp output, reflectances different than assumed)

**C-4: Punch List Management**
- Document all deficiencies found during testing
- Track corrective actions and re-testing
- Obtain Employer acceptance of resolutions

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Test Grid Density vs. Time**
- Fine test grid (many points) provides detailed data but takes more time
- Coarser grid or spot checks faster but may miss variations
- **Resolution:** Focus detail on critical areas; use representative sampling for routine areas

**T-2: Testing Rigor vs. Schedule**
- Comprehensive testing ensures quality but takes time
- Minimal testing speeds closeout but may miss deficiencies
- **Resolution:** Test per specification requirements; prioritize safety-critical items (emergency lighting)

## Examples

**E-1: Illumination Test Record Example**

| Location | Grid Point | Measured (lux) | Calculated (lux) | % of Calc | Status |
|----------|------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| Process Area East | P1 | 68 | 75 | 91% | PASS |
| Process Area East | P2 | 52 | 75 | 69% | FAIL - Investigate |
| Roadway A | R1 | 18 | 15 | 120% | PASS |

**E-2: Emergency Lighting Duration Test Example**
- Test Date: [Date]
- Fixture: Emergency fixture EL-01
- Normal power disconnected: 20:00
- Emergency light activated: 20:00
- Test terminated: 21:35 (95 minutes) - PASS (>90 min required)
