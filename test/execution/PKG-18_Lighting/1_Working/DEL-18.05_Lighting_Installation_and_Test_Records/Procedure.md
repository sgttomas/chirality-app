# Procedure: DEL-18.05 Lighting Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for inspection, testing, and documentation of the lighting system.

**Deliverable Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for lighting. *(Source: _CONTEXT.md)*

**Deliverable Type:** Record | **Responsible Party:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies (NOT_TRACKED - coordinated externally):**
- Lighting installation substantially complete
- Electrical power available and energized (PKG-17)
- Control systems commissioned (PKG-19) for integrated controls testing

**Reference Materials:**
- Lighting Design Drawings (DEL-18.01) — for verification
- Lighting Technical Specification (DEL-18.02) — for requirements
- Lighting Design Calculations (DEL-18.03) — for comparison
- Lighting Data Sheet Package (DEL-18.04) — for equipment verification

**Test Equipment:**
- Illuminance meters (lux meters) with current calibration
- Multimeters for electrical verification
- Stopwatches for emergency duration testing
- Camera for installation photographs

**Personnel:**
- Contractor QA/QC personnel to conduct tests
- Electrical Engineer to witness and verify
- Employer representative or commissioning agent to witness (if required)

## Steps

### Step 1: Installation Inspection
- Verify all fixtures installed per drawings (DEL-18.01)
- Check mounting, alignment, security, wiring, grounding
- Document on installation checklists
- Photograph installed conditions
- Mark up as-built deviations

### Step 2: Illumination Testing - Exterior
- Conduct testing at night in dry conditions
- Set up test grid matching calculation grid (DEL-18.03) where practical
- Measure illuminance at each grid point using calibrated lux meter
- Record measurements on test forms with location plan
- Compare to calculated values; identify pass/fail per acceptance criteria

### Step 3: Illumination Testing - Interior
- Conduct testing with windows/doors closed to block daylight (if needed)
- Measure illuminance per test grid
- Record measurements
- Compare to calculated values

### Step 4: Emergency Lighting Testing
**Illuminance Testing:**
- Disconnect normal power to activate emergency lighting
- Measure illuminance along egress paths
- Verify ≥10 lux avg, ≥1 lux min per NFPA 101

**Duration Testing:**
- Disconnect normal power
- Monitor emergency lights for 90+ minutes
- Record time to failure or confirm 90-minute duration achieved

### Step 5: Control System Functional Testing
- Test occupancy sensors (on/off, time delays)
- Test photocells and daylight sensors
- Test manual controls (switches, contactors)
- Test integration with facility controls (PKG-19)
- Verify control zones operate correctly

### Step 6: Document Deficiencies (Punch List)
- Document all deficiencies found
- Classify by severity
- Assign responsibility for corrective actions

### Step 7: Corrective Actions and Re-Testing
- Implement corrective actions (re-aim fixtures, replace lamps, adjust controls, etc.)
- Re-test affected areas
- Document resolutions

### Step 8: Final Acceptance
- Compile test records package
- Obtain witness signatures
- Submit to Employer for acceptance
- Obtain final acceptance certificate
- File records in `3_Issued/` and project DMS

### Step 9: Training and Closeout
- Conduct owner/operator training on operation and maintenance
- Deliver O&M manuals
- Update as-built drawings with field markups
- Archive all records

## Verification

**V-1: Installation Complete** — All fixtures installed and functional
**V-2: Illuminance Verified** — Measured levels meet requirements
**V-3: Emergency Lighting Verified** — Duration and illuminance per NFPA 101
**V-4: Controls Functional** — All controls tested and operational
**V-5: Documentation Complete** — All test records signed and filed

**Sign-Off:** Employer final acceptance certificate — **TBD**

## Records

**Documentation Outputs:**
1. **Illumination test records** — Field measurements for exterior and interior areas

*(Source: _CONTEXT.md, Decomposition)*

**Record Organization:**
- Installation inspection checklists
- Illumination test forms with measurements
- Emergency lighting test results
- Control functional test results
- Punch list and resolutions
- Final acceptance certificate
- Training records and O&M manual delivery confirmation

**Retention:** Permanent retention as project closeout documentation
