# Guidance: DEL-18.04 Lighting Data Sheet Package

## Purpose

**Deliverable Purpose:** Defines and substantiates lighting in accordance with ER requirements. *(Source: _CONTEXT.md)*

**Role in Project:** This data sheet package provides manufacturer product information that:
- Demonstrates proposed equipment meets specification requirements (DEL-18.02)
- Provides photometric data (IES files) for calculations (DEL-18.03)
- Supports procurement and construction
- Provides installation and warranty reference

**Deliverable Classification:** Type: Data Sheet | Discipline: Electrical | Responsible: D&B Contractor

## Principles

**P-1: Submittal Process**
- Data sheets submitted for review and approval before procurement — standard EPC practice — **ASSUMPTION**
- Review verifies compliance with specification and design coordination
- Approval required to proceed with procurement — **TBD**

**P-2: IES Photometric Data Importance**
- IES files (IESNA LM-63 format) essential for accurate photometric calculations
- Files should be from IES LM-79 laboratory testing by independent test lab
- Generic files acceptable for preliminary calculations; manufacturer-specific required for final

**P-3: Certification Requirements**
- CSA or UL certification demonstrates compliance with safety standards
- Hazardous location certifications critical for fixtures in classified areas
- Certifications must be current and applicable to specific model/configuration

## Considerations

**C-1: Manufacturer Selection**
- Approved manufacturers list (if exists) limits submittal options
- "Or equal" submittals require demonstration of equivalent performance
- Consider manufacturer reputation, warranty, local support

**C-2: Equipment Availability**
- Verify equipment is current production (not discontinued)
- Confirm lead times acceptable for project schedule
- Identify long-lead items early

**C-3: Data Sheet Completeness**
- Ensure all required information is present (performance, electrical, materials, dimensions)
- Missing information may delay approval or require resubmittal
- Request supplemental data from manufacturer if needed

**C-4: Coordination**
- Verify data sheet fixtures match drawings (DEL-18.01)
- Verify performance meets specification (DEL-18.02)
- Verify IES files usable in calculations (DEL-18.03)

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Manufacturer Standardization vs. Competition**
- Single manufacturer simplifies spares but may limit competition and increase cost
- Multiple manufacturers increases competition but complicates spare parts inventory

**T-2: Submittal Timing**
- Early submittals allow design verification but may require changes if design evolves
- Late submittals may delay procurement but ensure final design compatibility

## Examples

**E-1: Typical Data Sheet Contents**
