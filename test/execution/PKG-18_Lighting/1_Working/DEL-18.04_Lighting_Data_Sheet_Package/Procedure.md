- Lighting Design Drawings (DEL-18.01) — fixture types and quantities
- Lighting Technical Specification (DEL-18.02) — performance requirements
- Lighting Design Calculations (DEL-18.03) — photometric basis (iterative)
- Employer's Requirements — approved manufacturers (if applicable)

**Reference Materials:**
- Manufacturer product catalogs and websites
- Specification (DEL-18.02) for requirements
- Drawings (DEL-18.01) for fixture schedule

**Personnel Requirements:**

- Request IES photometric files (LM-63 format) for all fixtures
- Request certifications (CSA, UL, hazardous location if applicable)
- Request warranty documentation

### Step 4: Compile Data Sheet Package
- Organize data sheets by category (fixtures, poles, certifications, warranties)
- Prepare cover sheet with project information, submittal date, transmittal — **TBD**
- Verify all required information is included
- Create submittal package per project submittal format — **TBD**

### Step 5: Internal Review
- Review data sheets for completeness
- Verify compliance with specification (DEL-18.02)
- Verify coordination with drawings (DEL-18.01)
- Verify IES files included and compatible with calculation software (DEL-18.03)

### Step 6: Submit for Approval
