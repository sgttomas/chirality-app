# Guidance: DEL-21.02 Building Technical Specification

## Purpose

This guidance supports the development of **Building Technical Specification** for **PKG-21 Building Structures & Envelope**.

**Deliverable Purpose:** Defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for building per ER requirements.

**Source:** Decomposition document line 514

**Role in Project:**

Technical specifications provide the material, product, and workmanship requirements that contractors use for procurement and installation. They complement the design drawings (DEL-21.01) by defining "what" materials and "how" to install them, while drawings define "where" and "how much."

Specifications serve as:
- Procurement basis for materials and products
- Installation quality standards for contractors
- Acceptance criteria for inspection and testing
- Legal contract requirements (part of contract documents)

**Project Objectives Supported:**
- **OBJ-1: Safe & Reliable Operation** — Material quality and installation workmanship ensure reliable building performance
- **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** — Specifications enforce code-compliant materials and practices
- **OBJ-9: Lifecycle Cost Optimization** — Material durability and quality affect maintenance costs

## Principles

### P1: Performance-Based vs. Prescriptive Specification

**Performance Specification:**
- Defines required performance characteristics (strength, thermal resistance, fire rating)
- Allows multiple products/systems that meet performance criteria
- Example: "Wall insulation shall achieve minimum R-20 thermal resistance"

**Prescriptive Specification:**
- Defines specific products, materials, or methods
- Limited substitutions
- Example: "Use XYZ Brand rigid insulation, 4-inch thickness"

**Guidance:** Use performance-based specifications where possible (allows competition, value engineering). Use prescriptive specifications where performance cannot be easily measured or specific products are required by Employer.

**Source:** Specification best practices; Design & Build contract encourages performance-based approach

### P2: Material Durability in Coastal/Industrial Environment

Fraser Surrey Terminal coastal/industrial location requires durable materials:
- **Corrosion resistance:** Galvanized or stainless steel fasteners, marine-grade coatings
- **UV resistance:** Exterior sealants and coatings rated for outdoor exposure
- **Moisture resistance:** Corrosion-resistant cladding and trim
- **Freeze-thaw durability:** Concrete and masonry materials rated for freeze-thaw exposure

**Design Intent:** Select materials with proven durability in coastal BC climate (wet, marine exposure, freeze-thaw cycling).

### P3: CSI 3-Part Section Format

Standard specification organization:
- **Part 1: General** — Scope, references, submittals, quality assurance, delivery/storage, warranty
- **Part 2: Products** — Manufacturers, materials, mixes, fabrication, finishes
- **Part 3: Execution** — Examination, preparation, installation, field quality control, cleaning, protection

**Rationale:** Industry-standard format familiar to contractors; facilitates clear communication of requirements.

**Source:** CSI MasterFormat specification standards

### P4: Trade Standards for Workmanship

Industry trade organizations publish installation standards:
- **SMACNA** (Sheet Metal): Metal roofing, flashing, ductwork installation
- **CSSBI** (Sheet Steel Building): Metal panel installation
- **CISC** (Steel Construction): Structural steel fabrication and erection
- **AWS** (Welding Society): Welding procedures and quality
- **ACI** (Concrete Institute): Concrete placing and finishing

**Guidance:** Reference trade standards in specifications rather than rewriting installation procedures. Example: "Install metal roofing per SMACNA Architectural Sheet Metal Manual."

**Source:** Industry trade standards; NBC 2020 acceptable construction practices

### P5: Submittal Review Process

Submittals provide quality control before installation:
- **Product data:** Manufacturer literature showing product complies with specification
- **Shop drawings:** Fabrication details for contractor-fabricated items
- **Samples:** Physical samples for Employer approval (finishes, colors)
- **Certificates:** Material test reports, installer certifications

**Guidance:** Require submittals for major building systems (envelope, doors, structural steel). Define review timeframes and approval criteria.

## Considerations

### C1: Coordination with Design Drawings (DEL-21.01)

Specifications and drawings must be coordinated:
- Material callouts on drawings must match specification sections
- Conflicts between drawings and specifications must be resolved (**TBD**: Establish precedence rule — "specifications govern materials, drawings govern quantities and locations" is common)
- Detail references must align (drawing details reference specification sections)

**Action:** Perform coordination review between drawings and specifications before issue.

### C2: Approved Manufacturers and "Or Equal" Provisions

**Options:**
1. **Single-source specification:** Specify one manufacturer/product
   - Use only when truly proprietary or Employer-mandated
2. **Three-name specification:** List 3 acceptable manufacturers
   - Provides competition while ensuring quality
3. **Performance specification with "or equal":** Define performance, allow substitutions
   - Maximum competition; requires evaluation process

**Guidance:** For Design & Build contracts, use three-name or performance-based specifications to allow contractor value engineering while maintaining quality.

### C3: Material Availability and Lead Times

Consider material availability and procurement lead times:
- Standard materials (commodity steel, concrete, common doors): readily available
- Custom/specialty items (pre-engineered buildings, specialty doors, custom panels): long lead times (8-16 weeks typical)
- **TBD** — Review availability with suppliers before specifying

**Impact on Schedule:** Long-lead items affect construction schedule. Identify and order early.

**Source:** Construction logistics; OBJ-5 (Terminal Continuity) requires schedule efficiency

### C4: Sustainability and Lifecycle Cost (OBJ-9)

Material selection affects lifecycle costs:
- **Durability:** Higher-quality materials reduce maintenance/replacement frequency
- **Energy performance:** Enhanced insulation reduces operating energy costs
- **Maintenance access:** Specify replaceable components (roofing membranes, sealants) with reasonable service life
- **Recycled content:** **TBD** — Employer sustainability goals may favor recycled materials

**Trade-off:** Higher first cost vs. lower lifecycle cost. Perform lifecycle cost analysis for major systems.

**Source:** Decomposition Section 2 (OBJ-9: Lifecycle Cost Optimization)

### C5: Installer Qualifications and Certifications

Critical systems require qualified installers:
- **Roofing:** Manufacturer-certified roofing installers (roof warranties typically require certification)
- **Structural steel:** CSA W47.1 certified welding fabricators
- **Fire-rated assemblies:** Installers familiar with ULC-tested assembly requirements
- **Air barriers:** Installers trained in air barrier installation techniques

**Guidance:** Specify installer qualifications for critical systems. Verify qualifications before work begins.

### C6: Warranty Requirements

Typical building warranty structure:
- **Contractor workmanship warranty:** 1 year (statutory minimum in many jurisdictions)
- **Material manufacturer warranties:** Varies by product (typically 1-5 years)
- **Extended system warranties:** Roofing systems (10-20 years), envelope systems (5-10 years)

**Guidance:** Specify extended warranties for major envelope systems. Verify warranty transferability to Employer.

## Trade-offs

### T1: Modular vs. Stick-Built Construction

**Modular Building Systems:**
- **Advantages:** Faster construction, factory quality control, reduced site labor
- **Disadvantages:** Design flexibility limited by module dimensions, transportation/crane requirements

**Stick-Built (Conventional Construction):**
- **Advantages:** Design flexibility, local labor/materials
- **Disadvantages:** Longer construction, weather-dependent, site quality control challenges

**Specification Approach:**
- **If modular:** Specify modular building system performance requirements (CSI Division 13.12.00)
- **If stick-built:** Specify materials and installation per CSI Divisions 03, 05, 07, 08

**Decision Factor:** Schedule, site access, terminal continuity (OBJ-5), cost. Modular favors schedule and terminal continuity.

### T2: Insulated Metal Panels (IMP) vs. Built-Up Envelope

**Insulated Metal Panels (IMP):**
- **Advantages:** Fast installation, integrated insulation, proven weathertightness, low maintenance
- **Disadvantages:** Limited architectural expression, potential thermal bridging at panel joints

**Built-Up Envelope (Framing + Insulation + Cladding):**
- **Advantages:** Design flexibility, optimized thermal performance
- **Disadvantages:** More labor-intensive, more potential for installation defects

**Specification Approach:**
- **If IMP:** CSI 07 42 00 (Wall Panels), specify IMP performance (R-value, finish, fastening)
- **If built-up:** Multiple CSI sections (framing, insulation, cladding)

**Decision Factor:** Thermal performance requirements, schedule, cost, architectural requirements. IMP common for industrial buildings.

### T3: Fire-Rated vs. Non-Rated Doors

**Fire-Rated Doors (ULC S104):**
- **Required when:** Fire separations per NBC 2020 Part 3 (depends on building classification, area, occupancy)
- **Cost impact:** Higher cost, specific hardware required (fire-rated hinges, closers, no hold-opens unless tied to fire alarm)

**Non-Rated Doors:**
- **Use when:** No fire separation required
- **Cost impact:** Lower cost, standard hardware

**Specification Approach:** Review NBC 2020 Part 3 to determine fire rating requirements. Specify ULC S104-tested assemblies with labeled components where required.

### T4: Standard vs. High-Performance Glazing

**Standard Glazing:**
- Minimum code compliance (NBC 2020 Part 5)
- Lower cost

**High-Performance Glazing (Low-E, insulated glass):**
- Enhanced thermal performance (lower U-value)
- Potential energy cost savings
- Higher first cost

**Decision Factor:** Building conditioning requirements (MCC building may need cooling for equipment heat), lifecycle cost analysis (OBJ-9).
