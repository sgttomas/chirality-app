### Quality Requirements

**QR-01: Review Process**
- Design team reviews shop drawings for compliance with design intent
- Review does not relieve contractor of responsibility for dimensions, quantities, means/methods
- Review actions: Approved, Approved as Noted, Revise and Resubmit, Rejected
- **TBD** — Review turnaround time

**QR-02: Fabrication Quality**
- Fabrication per approved shop drawings
- Quality control inspections during fabrication
- Fabricator certifications (CSA W47.1 for welding) — **TBD**

**QR-03: As-Built Documentation**
