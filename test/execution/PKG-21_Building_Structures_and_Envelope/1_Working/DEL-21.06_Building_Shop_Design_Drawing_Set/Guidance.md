# Guidance: DEL-21.06 Building Shop Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

**Deliverable Purpose:** Defines and substantiates building shop in accordance with ER requirements.
**Source:** Decomposition line 518

**Role:** Shop drawings translate design intent into fabrication instructions. They demonstrate how contractor/fabricator will produce and install building components per design documents. Shop drawings require design team review/approval before fabrication.

**Project Objectives Supported:**
- **OBJ-1: Safe & Reliable Operation** — Quality shop drawings ensure proper fabrication and installation
- **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** — Shop drawings demonstrate code-compliant fabrication

## Principles

### P1: Shop Drawings vs. Design Drawings

**Design Drawings (DEL-21.01):**
- Show overall design arrangement, dimensions, systems
- Prepared by design team (engineer/architect)
- Prescriptive ("what" is required)

**Shop Drawings (DEL-21.06):**
- Show fabrication and installation details
- Prepared by contractor/fabricator
- Descriptive ("how" fabricator will do it)
- Based on design drawings and specifications
- Require design team review/approval

**Key Distinction:** Design drawings show design intent; shop drawings show fabrication intent.

### P2: Design Team Review Responsibility

Design team reviews shop drawings for:
- **General compliance** with design intent
- **Major deviations** from design documents
- **Adequacy of connections** and structural elements

Design team review **does not include**:
- Field dimensions and measurements (contractor responsibility)
- Quantities and material orders (contractor responsibility)
- Means and methods of fabrication/installation (contractor responsibility)
- Coordination with contractor's other work (contractor responsibility)

**Guidance:** Contractor remains responsible for shop drawing accuracy even after design team approval.

### P3: Fabrication Tolerances

Fabrication tolerances affect fit-up during installation:
- **Steel fabrication tolerances:** CSA S16 (typically ±3mm for member length, ±1.5mm for hole spacing)
- **Panel fabrication tolerances:** Manufacturer standards (tighter for architectural metal panels)
- **Field erection tolerances:** CSA S16 or CISC standards

**Critical Interfaces:**
- Base plate anchor bolts (field placement tolerances)
- Module-to-module connections (tight tolerances required)
- Envelope panel alignment (visible joints require tight tolerances)

**Guidance:** Fabricator must account for tolerances in shop drawing dimensions. Field verification of critical dimensions before fabrication.

### P4: Welding and Connection Details

Shop drawings show welding details per CSA W59:
- Weld symbols per AWS A2.4
- Weld sizes, types (fillet, groove, etc.)
- Welding procedures (FCAW, GMAW, SMAW, etc.)
- Non-destructive testing (NDT) requirements (if specified)

Bolted connections show:
- Bolt type, grade, size
- Bolt layout and spacing
- Hole sizes (standard, oversized, slotted)
- Tightening requirements (snug-tight, pre-tensioned)

**Guidance:** Fabricator must be CSA W47.1 certified for welded steel fabrication. Provide welding procedures and welder qualifications in submittal.

### P5: Modular Building Shop Drawings (if applicable)

If modular building approach used:
- Manufacturer provides shop drawings showing module fabrication
- Includes structural framing, envelope panels, doors/windows, utilities
- Shows transportation and lifting provisions
- Shows module-to-module connections and site assembly

**Design Team Review Focus:**
- Structural adequacy of modules and connections
- Compliance with building code (NBC 2020)
- Compliance with design drawings and specifications
- Interface compatibility with site work (foundations, utilities)

**Source:** Modular building industry practice

## Considerations

### C1: Submittal Timing and Schedule

Shop drawings require lead time:
- **Preparation time:** Fabricator prepares shop drawings (2-4 weeks typical)
- **Review time:** Design team reviews and returns comments (1-2 weeks typical)
- **Revision time** (if required): Fabricator revises and resubmits (1-2 weeks)
- **Fabrication time:** After approval, fabrication begins (4-12 weeks typical depending on item)

**Critical Path Impact:** Shop drawing delays affect fabrication and construction schedule.

**Action:** Establish submittal schedule early. Prioritize long-lead items (structural steel, modular buildings).

### C2: Field Verification Requirements

Critical field dimensions should be verified before fabrication:
- **Anchor bolt locations** — Surveyed after concrete placement, before base plate fabrication
- **Module foundation dimensions** — Verified before module fabrication
- **Opening dimensions** — Verified before door/window fabrication (if site-fabricated frames)

**Guidance:** Contractor responsible for field verification. Shop drawings note "verify in field" for critical dimensions.

### C3: Proprietary Systems and Manufacturer Input

Some building systems are proprietary:
- Pre-engineered metal buildings (PEMBs)
- Modular buildings
- Insulated metal panel systems

**Approach:**
- Engage manufacturer early for design-assist input
- Manufacturer provides shop drawings per their standard practices
- Design team reviews for compliance with performance requirements

**Guidance:** Performance specifications (DEL-21.02) allow flexibility for proprietary systems while ensuring compliance.

### C4: As-Built Documentation

If field conditions differ from shop drawings:
- Document deviations (field changes, substitutions)
- Update shop drawings to as-built conditions
- File as-built shop drawings in project records (DEL-21.05)

**Importance:** As-built shop drawings needed for future maintenance, renovations, warranty claims.

### C5: Digital Fabrication and BIM

Modern fabrication uses digital workflows:
- **BIM models** (Building Information Modeling) — 3D models for coordination
- **CNC fabrication** — Computer-controlled cutting, drilling, welding from 3D models
- **IFC file exchange** — Interoperability between design and fabrication software

**Benefit:** Improved accuracy, reduced fabrication errors, faster production.

**Consideration:** Requires compatible software and data exchange protocols — **TBD**

## Trade-offs

### T1: Shop Drawing Detail Level

**Option A: Minimal Shop Drawings**
- Show only basic dimensions and connections
- Advantages: Faster preparation, less review time
- Disadvantages: Fabricator interpretation may vary, potential fit-up issues

**Option B: Detailed Shop Drawings**
- Show all fabrication details, bolt/weld locations, tolerances
- Advantages: Clear fabrication instructions, fewer field issues
- Disadvantages: More preparation time, more review time

**Guidance:** Use detailed shop drawings for complex or critical items (structural connections, architectural features). Use minimal shop drawings for simple, repetitive items.

### T2: Review Turnaround Time

**Expedited Review (1 week):**
- Advantages: Faster schedule
- Disadvantages: Less thorough review, potential for missed issues

**Standard Review (2 weeks):**
- Advantages: Adequate time for thorough review
- Disadvantages: Longer schedule

**Guidance:** Establish standard review turnaround time (2 weeks typical). Use expedited review only for critical path items.
