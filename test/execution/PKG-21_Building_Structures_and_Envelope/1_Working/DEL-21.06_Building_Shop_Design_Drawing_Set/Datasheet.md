## Conditions

**Deliverable Purpose:**
Defines and substantiates building shop in accordance with ER requirements.
**Source:** Decomposition line 518

**Anticipated Shop Drawing Artifacts:**

Per decomposition (line 518):
1. **Fabrication/shop drawings for modular building** — Factory fabrication details for modular building units (if modular approach used)
2. **Envelope details** — Fabrication details for cladding panels, flashing, trim
3. **Structural connection details** — Steel connection shop details, anchor bolts, base plates

**Shop Drawing Purpose:**

Shop drawings are contractor/fabricator-prepared drawings showing:
- **How items will be fabricated** — Dimensions, materials, assembly methods
- **How items will be installed** — Connections, anchorage, field welds/bolts
- **Compliance with design drawings and specifications** — Demonstrates conformance with design intent

Shop drawings are submitted to design team for review and approval before fabrication/procurement.

**Shop Drawing Content:**

**Modular Building Shop Drawings (if applicable):**
- Module dimensions and assembly
- Structural framing details
- Envelope panel details
- Door/window installations
- Utility connections and penetrations
- Transportation and lifting details

**Envelope Shop Drawings:**
- Cladding panel layouts and dimensions
- Panel fabrication details (insulation, facing, fasteners)
- Flashing and trim details
- Sealant joint details
- Roof panel details and fastening
- Expansion joint details

**Structural Connection Shop Drawings:**
- Steel connection details (beam-to-column, column-to-base, bracing connections)
- Bolt layouts and sizes
- Weld details and specifications
- Base plate dimensions and anchor bolt layouts
- Fabrication tolerances
- Material specifications and certifications

## Construction

**Shop Drawing Process:**

**Preparation:**
- Fabricator/contractor prepares shop drawings based on design drawings (DEL-21.01), specifications (DEL-21.02), and calculations (DEL-21.03)
- Shows fabrication intent and installation method
- Includes material specifications, weld symbols, bolt types

**Submittal:**
- Contractor submits shop drawings to design team for review
- Submittal includes cover letter identifying drawings and requesting action
- **TBD** — Submittal schedule and lead time requirements

**Review:**
- Design team reviews shop drawings for compliance with design intent
- Review does not relieve contractor of responsibility for dimensions, quantities, or means/methods
- Review actions: Approved, Approved as Noted, Revise and Resubmit, Rejected
- Design team comments returned to contractor

**Resubmittal (if required):**
- Contractor addresses review comments
- Revises shop drawings as needed
- Resubmits for review

**Fabrication:**
- After approval, contractor/fabricator proceeds with fabrication
- Shop drawings used as fabrication instructions
- Quality control during fabrication per specifications

**Field Installation:**
- Shop drawings used for field installation guidance
- Field dimensions verified before fabrication (critical items)
- As-built conditions documented if deviations from shop drawings

**Source:** Construction submittals process; industry standard practice
