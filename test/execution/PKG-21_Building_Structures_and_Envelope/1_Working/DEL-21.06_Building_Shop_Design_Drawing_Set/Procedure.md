     - Provide fabrication schedule and lead time
   - Include supporting documentation:
     - Material certificates/certifications
     - Fabricator qualifications (CSA W47.1 for welding, etc.)
     - Product literature (for proprietary items)

2.2 **Submit to Design Team**
   - Submit via project document management system or transmittal
   - Record submittal in submittal log (submittal number, date, description)

### Step 3: Design Team Review

**Objective:** Design team reviews shop drawings and provides review action.

**Activities:**

3.1 **Design Team Review**
   - Design team (engineer, architect) reviews shop drawings
   - Checks general compliance with design intent
   - Checks for major deviations from design documents
   - Checks adequacy of connections and structural elements
   - **TBD** — Review turnaround time (typically 1-2 weeks)

3.2 **Review Actions**
   - **Approved:** Proceed with fabrication (no revisions required)
   - **Approved as Noted:** Proceed with fabrication, incorporate noted corrections
   - **Revise and Resubmit:** Revise per comments and resubmit for review (do not fabricate)
   - **Rejected:** Major non-compliance, significant revisions required

3.3 **Return Review Comments**
   - Design team returns reviewed shop drawings with comments and review action
   - Comments marked on drawings or provided in separate comment log

**Deliverables:** Reviewed shop drawings with design team comments and review action

### Step 4: Address Review Comments

**Objective:** Contractor addresses design team comments and revises shop drawings if required.

**Activities:**

4.1 **Review Comments and Determine Action**
   - Contractor reviews design team comments
   - If **Approved** or **Approved as Noted:** Proceed to fabrication (Step 5)
   - If **Revise and Resubmit** or **Rejected:** Revise shop drawings (Step 4.2)

4.2 **Revise Shop Drawings** (if required)
   - Revise shop drawings per design team comments
