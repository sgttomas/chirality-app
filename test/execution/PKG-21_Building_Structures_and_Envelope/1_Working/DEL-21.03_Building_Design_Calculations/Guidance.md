# Guidance: DEL-21.03 Building Design Calculations

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Building Design Calculations** for **PKG-21 Building Structures & Envelope**.

Provides the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for building.

This deliverable is classified as a **Calculation** under the **Buildings** discipline, to be produced by **D&B Contractor**.

## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Buildings discipline):**

- **TBD** — Governing engineering principles to be articulated during design development
- **ASSUMPTION**: Design shall follow good engineering practice per applicable codes and Employer's Requirements
- **TBD** — Discipline-specific design philosophy to be confirmed

**Applicable standards context:**
- NBC 2020
- ABC 2019
- ASHRAE 90.1
- CSA A23.3
- CSA S16

## Considerations

**Factors to consider during development:**

- Package scope: PKG-21 Building Structures & Envelope
- Deliverable type: Calculation — consider type-specific requirements and conventions
- Coordination with adjacent packages — see `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (NOT_TRACKED)
- Employer's Requirements — review for project-specific constraints
- Regulatory requirements — **TBD**
- Constructability — **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**: To be considered during design development
- Operability and maintainability — **TBD**

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

- **TBD** — Cost vs. performance trade-offs
- **TBD** — Schedule vs. quality considerations
- **TBD** — Standardization vs. optimization
- **TBD** — Design conservatism vs. material efficiency
- **ASSUMPTION**: Trade-off decisions to be documented in design rationale records

## Examples

**Reference examples and precedents:**

- Refer to Employer's Requirements for project-specific expectations
- **TBD** — Industry precedent and best practice examples
- **TBD** — Lessons learned from similar facilities
- Anticipated artifacts for reference:
- Building structural calculations
- foundation calculations
- wind/seismic analysis
