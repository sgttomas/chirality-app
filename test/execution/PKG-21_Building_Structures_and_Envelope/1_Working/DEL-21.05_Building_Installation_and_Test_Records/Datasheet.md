## Conditions

**Deliverable Purpose:**
Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for building.
**Source:** Decomposition line 517

**Anticipated Record Artifacts:**

Per decomposition (line 517):
1. **Building inspection records** — Documentation of construction inspections and compliance verification
2. **Envelope test records** — Test results for building envelope performance (air leakage, water penetration, thermal performance)

**Record Categories:**

**Building Inspection Records:**
- Foundation inspection records (reinforcing, concrete placement, curing)
- Structural steel inspection records (connection verification, bolt torque, weld inspection)
- Envelope installation inspection records (cladding, roofing, insulation, air barrier installation)
- Door/window installation inspection records (installation, operation, weatherproofing)
- Building code compliance inspection records (building inspector sign-offs)
- Accessibility compliance inspection records
- Fire safety system inspection records (if fire-rated assemblies)

**Envelope Test Records:**
- Air leakage testing (whole-building or component testing per CSA A123.21 or ASTM E283)
- Water penetration testing (ASTM E331 or field water spray testing)
- Thermal imaging (infrared thermography to identify thermal bridging or insulation gaps)
- Mock-up testing (envelope assembly performance testing before full installation)

**Other QA/QC Records:**
- Material certificates and test reports (steel mill certificates, concrete test cylinders, product certifications)
- Welding inspection records (welder qualifications, weld inspection reports per CSA W59)
- Bolt torque records (high-strength bolt installation per CSA S16)
- Manufacturer's certificates (doors, windows, roofing, cladding)
- Installer certifications (roofing installer certification, air barrier installer training)
- Non-conformance reports (NCRs) and corrective actions
- Photographic records (progress photos, as-built conditions, problem areas)

## Construction

**Record Collection and Management:**

**During Construction:**
- QA/QC personnel perform inspections per project quality plan
- Inspection checklists completed for each work activity
- Test results documented (field tests and laboratory tests)
- Non-conformances identified and corrective actions tracked
- Records filed systematically (by package, by deliverable, or chronologically)

**At Completion:**
- Records compiled into organized packages
- Index/table of contents prepared
- Missing records identified and obtained
- Records reviewed for completeness
- Final QA/QC sign-off

**Record Content (typical inspection record):**
- Inspection date and time
- Inspector name and qualifications
- Work activity inspected (e.g., "Structural steel erection, Grid A-D")
- Inspection criteria (code requirements, specification requirements, drawing requirements)
- Inspection results (pass/fail, observations, measurements)
- Deficiencies identified
- Corrective actions required
- Follow-up inspection requirements
- Inspector signature and date

**Record Format:**
- **TBD** — Paper forms, electronic forms, photographs, test reports, certificates
