## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Quality Control Program

**Objective:** Set up QC program before construction begins.

**Activities:**
1.1 **Develop Inspection and Test Plan (ITP)**
   - Identify all inspection hold points (foundation, structural, envelope)
   - Identify all required tests (air leakage, water penetration, material testing)
   - Define acceptance criteria (per NBC 2020, specifications)
   - Establish inspection frequencies
   - **TBD** — Coordinate with project Quality Management Plan

1.2 **Prepare Inspection Forms**
   - Develop inspection checklists for each activity (foundation, steel, envelope, etc.)
   - Include inspection criteria, results fields, inspector sign-off
   - **TBD** — Use project standard forms or develop custom forms

1.3 **Qualify Inspectors and Testers**
   - Verify inspector qualifications (P.Eng., certifications, training)
   - Verify testing agency accreditations (if third-party testing)
   - Document qualifications in project records

**Deliverables:** Inspection and Test Plan (ITP), inspection forms, inspector qualifications

### Step 2: Perform Construction Inspections

**Objective:** Inspect work for compliance during construction.

**Activities:**

2.1 **Inspection Hold Points**
   - Contractor notifies QA/QC when work ready for inspection
   - Inspector performs inspection at hold point (before proceeding to next activity)
   - Inspector completes inspection checklist
   - Inspector signs off (pass) or identifies deficiencies (fail)

2.2 **Daily/Routine Inspections**
   - Inspector performs daily site walk-throughs
   - Observes work in progress for compliance
   - Documents observations (notes, photos)

2.3 **Documentation**
   - Complete inspection checklist for each inspection
   - Record date, location, inspector, results
   - Take photographs of key items and deficiencies
   - File inspection records in project DMS or binders

2.4 **Deficiency Management**
   - If deficiencies identified, document on Non-Conformance Report (NCR)
   - Issue NCR to contractor
   - Track corrective action (Step 4)

**Deliverables:** Completed inspection checklists, photographs, NCRs (if deficiencies)

### Step 3: Perform Construction Testing

**Objective:** Conduct required tests to verify performance.

**Activities:**

3.1 **Material Testing**
   - Collect material certificates from suppliers (steel, concrete, products)
   - Perform field testing (concrete slump, air content, strength cylinders)
   - Send samples to laboratory for testing (if required)
   - Review test reports for compliance with specifications

3.2 **Envelope Performance Testing**
   - **Air Leakage Testing:**
     - Coordinate with contractor (envelope must be substantially complete)
     - Engage testing agency (if third-party testing required)
     - Perform blower door test per CSA A123.21 or ASTM E283
     - Document test results (air leakage rate, pass/fail, observations)

   - **Water Penetration Testing:**
     - Coordinate with contractor (envelope complete, accessible)
     - Perform field spray testing or ASTM E331 testing
     - Document test results (leaks observed, pass/fail)

   - **Thermal Imaging** (if required):
     - Perform during heating season (temperature differential required)
     - Scan envelope with infrared camera
     - Identify insulation gaps, thermal bridges, air leaks
     - Document findings with thermal images and report

3.3 **Structural Testing** (if required)
   - Bolt torque verification (high-strength bolts per CSA S16)
   - Weld inspection (visual, ultrasonic, radiographic per CSA W59)
   - Load testing (if required for special structures)

3.4 **Documentation**
   - Obtain test reports from testing agency
   - Review test results against acceptance criteria
   - File test reports in project records
   - If test failures, document on NCR and track corrective action

**Deliverables:** Test reports (air leakage, water penetration, thermal imaging, material tests), photographs

### Step 4: Manage Non-Conformances

**Objective:** Track deficiencies and verify corrective actions.

**Activities:**

4.1 **Issue NCR**
   - Document non-conformance on NCR form
   - Include: description, location, date, severity, photos
   - Assign NCR number
   - Issue to contractor

4.2 **Determine Corrective Action**
   - Contractor proposes corrective action (repair, replace, engineering review)
   - QA/QC manager reviews and approves corrective action
   - For major non-conformances, engage design engineer for review

4.3 **Implement Corrective Action**
   - Contractor implements corrective action
   - QA/QC notified when corrective action complete

4.4 **Verify Corrective Action**
   - Inspector re-inspects corrective action
   - Perform re-testing if required
   - If satisfactory, close NCR
   - If unsatisfactory, issue new corrective action

4.5 **Track NCRs**
   - Maintain NCR register/log (all open and closed NCRs)
   - Report NCR status in project meetings

5.1 **Collect Records**
   - Gather all inspection checklists
   - Gather all test reports
   - Gather all material certificates
   - Gather all NCRs (closed)
   - Gather photographic records

5.2 **Review for Completeness**
   - Check against Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) — are all required inspections/tests documented?
   - Identify missing records
   - Obtain missing records from contractors or suppliers

5.3 **Organize Records**
   - Organize records by package, deliverable, or chronologically
   - Prepare table of contents/index
   - Place in binders or organize in project DMS folders

   - QA/QC manager reviews record package for completeness and compliance
   - Identifies any deficiencies
   - Prepares QA/QC completion certificate

5.5 **Submit to Employer**
   - Submit record package to Employer for review and acceptance
   - Address any Employer comments
   - Obtain Employer acceptance sign-off

**Deliverables:** Final record package (Building Inspection Records, Envelope Test Records)

### Step 6: Archive Records

**Objective:** Retain records per retention requirements.

**Activities:**
- Archive records in project DMS or physical storage
- Ensure records accessible for warranty claims and future reference
- **TBD** — Retention period per project and regulatory requirements

**Deliverables:** Archived records

## Verification

**V2: Employer Acceptance** (Step 5) — Employer reviews and accepts record package

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All required inspections documented
- All required tests performed and passing
- All NCRs closed
- Records complete and organized
- **TBD** — Employer sign-off
