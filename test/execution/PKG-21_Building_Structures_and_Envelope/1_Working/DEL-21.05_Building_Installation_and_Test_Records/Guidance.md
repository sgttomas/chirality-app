# Guidance: DEL-21.05 Building Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

**Deliverable Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for building.
**Source:** Decomposition line 517

**Role:** Installation and test records provide quality assurance documentation demonstrating work was performed per design documents, specifications, and codes. Records are required for building permit close-out, warranty claims, and future reference.

**Project Objectives Supported:**
- **OBJ-1: Safe & Reliable Operation** — QA/QC records demonstrate safe, compliant construction
- **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** — Records demonstrate code compliance to building authorities

## Principles

### P1: Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control

**Quality Assurance (QA):** Planned, systematic activities ensuring quality (quality plans, procedures, training)
**Quality Control (QC):** Inspection and testing activities verifying quality (inspections, tests, deficiency tracking)

**This deliverable is primarily QC records** — documentation of inspections and tests performed during construction.

### P2: Inspection Hold Points

Critical construction activities require inspection **before proceeding to next activity:**
- Foundation reinforcing inspection before concrete placement
- Structural steel connections inspection before covering/fireproofing
- Air barrier installation inspection before cladding installation
- Final building inspection before occupancy

**Guidance:** Establish inspection hold points in project quality plan. Do not proceed past hold point without inspection sign-off.

### P3: Testing for Building Envelope Performance

Building envelope testing verifies weathertightness and thermal performance:

**Air Leakage Testing:**
- Whole-building blower door test (pressurize/depressurize building, measure air leakage)
- Component testing (windows, doors, curtain wall assemblies)
- Acceptance criteria: **TBD** — NBC 2020 or project-specific limits

**Water Penetration Testing:**
- Field spray testing (hose water on envelope, observe for leaks)
- ASTM E331 testing (calibrated water spray with air pressure)
- Performed on mock-ups or installed envelope

**Thermal Imaging:**
- Infrared camera scan of envelope (identifies insulation gaps, thermal bridging, air leaks)
- Performed during heating season (temperature differential required)

### P4: Non-Conformance Management

Non-conformances (deficiencies) must be tracked and resolved:
1. Identify non-conformance (inspection or test failure)
2. Document on NCR form (description, location, severity)
3. Determine corrective action (repair, replace, accept as-is with engineering review)
4. Implement corrective action
5. Verify corrective action by re-inspection/re-testing
6. Close NCR

**Guidance:** Do not close NCRs without verification. Track NCRs in register/log.

### P5: Record Retention Requirements

Construction records have legal and warranty implications:
- **Regulatory retention:** Building codes may require record retention (varies by jurisdiction)
- **Warranty retention:** Records needed for warranty claims (typically 1-10 years)
- **Litigation retention:** Records may be needed for construction defect claims (can be many years)

**Guidance:** Retain records per project requirements — **TBD**: minimum 7-10 years typical.

## Considerations

### C1: Inspector Qualifications

Inspections must be performed by qualified personnel:
- **Structural inspections:** Engineer or certified inspector (CSA W178 for welding, ACI for concrete)
- **Envelope inspections:** Building envelope specialist or trained inspector
- **Code compliance inspections:** Building inspector (authority having jurisdiction)

**Action:** Verify inspector qualifications before work begins.

### C2: Testing Timing

Some tests must be performed at specific times:
- **Air leakage testing:** After envelope substantially complete, before interior finishes
- **Water penetration testing:** After envelope installation, during or before occupancy
- **Thermal imaging:** During heating season (temperature differential required)
- **Concrete testing:** During placement (slump, air content) and curing (strength cylinders at 7/28 days)

**Action:** Schedule tests appropriately in construction sequence.

### C3: Mock-Up Testing

For critical or repetitive envelope assemblies, consider mock-up testing:
- Build full-scale mock-up of envelope assembly
- Perform air leakage, water penetration, structural testing on mock-up
- Verify performance before full-scale installation
- Use mock-up as quality benchmark (contractor trains crews on mock-up)

**Benefit:** Identifies problems before full installation (avoids costly repairs).

### C4: Photographic Documentation

Photos provide valuable record of concealed work:
- Foundation reinforcing before concrete placement
- Structural connections before covering
- Air barrier installation before cladding
- Waterproofing before backfill

**Guidance:** Label photos with date, location, description. Organize in project DMS.

### C5: Record Organization

Records must be organized for easy retrieval:
- **By package/deliverable:** All PKG-21 records in one location
- **By date:** Chronological record of inspections
- **By location:** Records organized by building area or grid line

**Guidance:** Use consistent filing system. Prepare index/table of contents.

## Trade-offs

### T1: Inspection Frequency — Continuous vs. Sampling

**Continuous Inspection:**
- Advantages: Highest quality assurance, catches all defects
- Disadvantages: High cost (full-time inspector)

**Sampling Inspection:**
- Advantages: Lower cost (spot-checks and hold points only)
- Disadvantages: May miss defects between inspections

**Guidance:** Use continuous inspection for critical work (structural connections, fire-rated assemblies). Use sampling for repetitive, lower-risk work.

### T2: Testing Scope — Full vs. Representative

**Full Testing (test everything):**
- Advantages: Highest confidence
- Disadvantages: High cost and schedule impact

**Representative Testing (test samples):**
- Advantages: Lower cost, faster
- Disadvantages: Assumes untested items similar to tested items

**Guidance:** Test representative samples for repetitive items (windows, doors). Test all critical/unique items.

## Examples

### E1: Foundation Inspection Record Example

**Inspection:** Foundation Reinforcing
**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Inspector:** J. Smith, P.Eng.
**Location:** MCC Building, Grid A-D
**Criteria:** Reinforcing per drawing A-3.01, spacing per CSA A23.3
**Results:** PASS — Reinforcing size, spacing, cover verified. Tie wire connections adequate.
**Deficiencies:** None
**Action:** Ready for concrete placement. Notify ready for building inspector approval.
**Inspector Signature:** [Signed] J. Smith, P.Eng.

### E2: Air Leakage Test Report Example

**Test:** Whole-Building Air Leakage Test (Blower Door)
**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Tester:** ABC Testing Lab (accredited per CSA A123.21)
**Building:** MCC Building
**Test Method:** CSA A123.21 (depressurization to 75 Pa)
**Results:** Air leakage rate = 2.5 L/(s·m²) at 75 Pa
**Acceptance Criteria:** ≤ 3.0 L/(s·m²) per NBC 2020 — **PASS**
**Observations:** Minor air leakage at door threshold (weather-stripped during test). No significant leaks observed.
**Recommendation:** Seal door threshold for improved performance.

### E3: Non-Conformance Report Example

**NCR No.:** NCR-21-005
**Date:** 2026-04-10
**Description:** Structural steel bolt missing at connection B-3, Grid 5
**Location:** MCC Building, column splice
**Severity:** Major (affects structural capacity)
**Corrective Action:** Install missing bolt, torque per specification. Re-inspect connection.
**Implemented By:** Steel erector, 2026-04-11
**Verification:** Re-inspection by J. Smith, P.Eng. — 2026-04-11 — Connection complete and properly torqued.
**Status:** CLOSED
