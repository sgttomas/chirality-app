# Guidance: DEL-21.04 Building Data Sheet Package

## Purpose

**Deliverable Purpose:** Defines and substantiates building in accordance with ER requirements.
**Source:** Decomposition line 516

**Role:** Data sheets and schedules provide quick-reference summary of building characteristics and complete inventory of doors/windows for procurement and construction.

## Principles

### P1: Data Sheet as Summary Document

Data sheets summarize key information from design documents:
- Extracted from drawings (DEL-21.01), specifications (DEL-21.02), calculations (DEL-21.03)
- Provides single-page reference for building parameters
- Used by Employer for facility records

### P2: Schedules as Procurement Basis

Door/window schedules provide complete inventory:
- Basis for door/window procurement
- Construction reference for installation
- Must match drawings and specifications exactly

## Considerations

### C1: Coordination Essential

Data sheets/schedules must coordinate with:
- Drawings: All doors/windows on drawings must be in schedules
- Specifications: Door/window types in schedules must match specification sections
- Calculations: Design loads and parameters must match calculations

### C2: Completeness Critical

Missing doors/windows from schedules causes:
- Procurement delays
- Construction conflicts
- Cost/schedule impacts

**Action:** Cross-check schedules against all drawing sheets.

## Trade-offs

### T1: Detail Level in Schedules

**Option A: Minimal Schedules** — Mark, type, size only
**Option B: Detailed Schedules** — Include all hardware, finishes, performance criteria

**Guidance:** Include sufficient detail for procurement without duplicating specification. Reference specification sections for detailed requirements.

## Examples

### E1: Building System Data Sheet Example

**Project:** Canola Oil Transload Facility
**Building:** MCC Building
**Dimensions:** 10m × 20m × 5m high (typical)
**Occupancy:** Group F (Industrial)
**Structural System:** Steel frame, bolted connections
**Envelope:** Insulated metal panels, R-20 walls, R-30 roof
**Foundation:** Concrete spread footings
**Design Loads:** Snow 2.4 kPa, Wind 0.5 kPa, Seismic Sa(0.2)=X
**Codes:** NBC 2020, CSA S16

### E2: Door Schedule Example

| Mark | Type | Size (mm) | Material | Fire Rating | Hardware | Remarks |
|------|------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| D-01 | Personnel | 900×2100 | Steel | - | Lever, closer | Main entrance |
| D-02 | Overhead | 3000×3000 | Insulated steel | - | Electric operator | Equipment access |
| D-03 | Personnel | 900×2100 | Steel | 45-min | Lever, panic, closer | Fire exit |

**Note:** Data sheets and schedules are living documents updated as design progresses.
