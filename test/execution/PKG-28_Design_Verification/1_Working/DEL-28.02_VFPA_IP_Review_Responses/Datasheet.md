## Conditions

**Regulatory / Environmental Context:**

VFPA In Principle (IP) Review is a regulatory approval process where the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority reviews preliminary facility designs to provide feedback and establish requirements before detailed design and construction proceed. IP Review responses document how the design addresses VFPA comments and requirements, supporting **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** — "The Works comply with all permits, codes, and authority requirements."

**Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6; Section 6, Objective-to-Deliverable Mapping: DEL-28.01–DEL-28.03 associated with OBJ-6; Section 1.1, Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC)

- **VFPA jurisdiction**: Fraser Surrey Terminal is located within VFPA (Vancouver Fraser Port Authority) federal port jurisdiction — VFPA is the regulatory authority for port-related development
- **IP Review purpose**: Early regulatory review to identify issues and establish requirements before detailed design investment — **ASSUMPTION**: Standard VFPA IP review process
- **Review timing**: IP Review typically occurs at early design stages (conceptual or preliminary design) — **TBD**: Specific IP review submission timing for this project
- **Review scope**: VFPA review focuses on marine works, environmental compliance, terminal operations, safety, security, and compatibility with port master plan — **ASSUMPTION**: Typical VFPA review scope
- **Regulatory context**: VFPA Project and Environmental Review (PER) process — **TBD**: Specific PER requirements and IP review framework
- **Environmental considerations**: IP Review addresses environmental protection per **OBJ-7: Environmental Protection** — "The Works include adequate containment, spill prevention, and environmental controls"
- **Terminal integration**: IP Review addresses **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity** — "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities"

## Construction

**Materials / Configuration:**

Anticipated artifacts:
- IP review response documents

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifacts)

**Typical IP Review Response Document Structure** — **ASSUMPTION**: Standard VFPA response format includes:
- Executive summary
- Introduction and project overview
- VFPA IP Review comment tracking table with D&B Contractor responses
- Supporting technical documentation (drawings, calculations, reports, specifications)
- Revised design documentation addressing VFPA requirements
- Commitment register (tracking commitments made to VFPA)
- Conclusion and next steps

**IP Review Comment Tracking Table Format** — **ASSUMPTION**: Typical structure

- Supporting Documentation Reference
- Status (Open, Addressed, Ongoing)

**Review Areas Typically Covered by VFPA IP Review** — **ASSUMPTION**: Standard VFPA review scope:
- **Marine structures**: Wharf design, berthing structures, fender systems, mooring (PKG-08, PKG-09) — VFPA jurisdiction over marine works
- **Environmental protection**: Containment systems, spill prevention, drainage, water quality (PKG-03, PKG-33) — Federal environmental requirements
- **Terminal operations**: Interface with existing terminal operations, traffic flow, railcar movements, vessel operations (PKG-07, PKG-10, PKG-11) — Terminal integration requirements
- **Safety and security**: Site security, emergency response, hazardous materials handling — Federal port security requirements
- **Master plan compatibility**: Alignment with Fraser Surrey Terminal master plan and future expansion (Phase 2) — **OBJ-8: Future Expandability**
- **Sustainability**: Energy efficiency, emissions, waste management — VFPA sustainability requirements

**Deliverable Coordination** — **ASSUMPTION**: IP Review responses coordinate with:
- Design Submission Packages (DEL-27.04) — IP Review occurs during early design stages
- Independent Design Verification Reports (DEL-28.01) — IDV may address VFPA IP Review comments
- Environmental permits and approvals (PKG-33) — IP Review informs environmental permitting
- Design Coordination records (DEL-28.03) — IP Review may identify coordination requirements
