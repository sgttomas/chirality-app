## Conditions

**Regulatory / Environmental Context:**

VFPA In Principle (IP) Review is a regulatory approval process where the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority reviews preliminary facility designs to provide feedback and establish requirements before detailed design and construction proceed. IP Review responses document how the design addresses VFPA comments and requirements, supporting **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance**.

| Condition | Value | Specification § | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| VFPA Jurisdiction | Fraser Surrey Terminal — federal port lands | Standards | VFPA regulatory authority |
| IP Review Purpose | Early regulatory review before detailed design | IR-1 | Per VFPA PER process |
| Review Timing | Early design stages (30%, 60%) | IR-1 | **TBD**: Specific timing |
| Environmental Review | Federal environmental requirements | IR-4 | Supports OBJ-7 |
| Terminal Integration | Interface with existing terminal operations | IR-5 | Supports OBJ-5 |
| Response Timeframe | **TBD** days from receipt of VFPA comments | PR-1 | Per project schedule |

**Additional Objective Support:**
- **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity** — IP Review addresses compatibility with existing terminal operations
- **OBJ-7: Environmental Protection** — IP Review addresses environmental compliance
