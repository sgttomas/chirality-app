## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Design discipline):**

| Principle ID | Principle | Specification Req | Procedure Step |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| P-1 | Early Regulatory Engagement | FR-1, IR-1 | Step 1 |
| P-2 | Regulatory Compliance as Project Foundation | FR-7, V-4 | Step 7.3, Step 8.3 |
| P-3 | Comprehensive Response Approach | FR-1, FR-3 | Step 4.1 |
| P-4 | Multi-Disciplinary Coordination | FR-6, IR-3, IR-5 | Step 2, Step 5.3 |
| P-5 | Commitment Management | FR-4, PR-3 | Step 4.4, Step 9 |
| P-6 | Environmental and Safety Focus | IR-4 | Step 4 |
| P-7 | Integration with Terminal Operations | IR-5 | Step 4 |

**P-1: Early Regulatory Engagement**
- VFPA In Principle (IP) Review is an early regulatory engagement process providing feedback before significant design investment
- Early engagement identifies regulatory issues early, reducing risk of late-stage design changes
- Effective IP Review responses demonstrate responsiveness and facilitate smooth permitting
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-1 (Response Preparation), IR-1 (Design Submissions)
- **Source:** Datasheet.md (IP Review purpose)

**P-2: Regulatory Compliance as Project Foundation**
- VFPA approval is essential for project authorization — facility is on VFPA federal port lands
- Regulatory compliance (OBJ-6) underpins all design work
- Unresolved VFPA issues can delay or block project — responsive responses are critical
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-7 (Response Submittal), V-4 (VFPA Acceptance)
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6; Section 1.1)

**P-3: Comprehensive Response Approach**
- Every VFPA comment must be addressed — no comment can be ignored without VFPA agreement
- Responses must be clear, complete, and technically sound
- Where design changes required, responses must describe what changes are being made
- Where commitments made, they must be clearly documented and tracked
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-1 (Response Preparation), FR-3 (Completeness)
- **Source:** Specification.md (FR-1, FR-3, FR-4)

**P-4: Multi-Disciplinary Coordination**
- VFPA comments often span multiple disciplines (marine, environmental, operations, safety)
- Responses require coordination across design teams for consistent, integrated approach
- Design Coordination (DEL-28.03) supports consistent responses to VFPA
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-6 (Design Team Coordination), IR-3 (Design Coordination), IR-5 (Discipline Packages)
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (PKG-28 scope)

**P-5: Commitment Management**
- Commitments made to VFPA are binding and must be fulfilled
- Commitment tracking essential to ensure all commitments completed on schedule
- Failure to fulfill commitments can damage relationship with VFPA and delay approvals
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-4 (Commitment Management), PR-3 (Commitment Fulfillment)
- **Source:** Specification.md (FR-4, PR-3)

**P-6: Environmental and Safety Focus**
- VFPA IP Review includes significant environmental review component
- Environmental compliance supports **OBJ-7: Environmental Protection**
- Safety and security are VFPA priorities — federal port security requirements apply
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md IR-4 (Environmental Permitting)
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-7)

**P-7: Integration with Terminal Operations**
- Fraser Surrey Terminal is an active commercial terminal — VFPA reviews operational compatibility
- IP Review addresses **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity**
- Responses must demonstrate design integration with existing operations
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md IR-5 (Discipline Packages)
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-5)

- **Guidance**: Establish realistic schedule allowing quality while meeting VFPA expectations; communicate if additional time needed
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md PR-1 (Timeliness), QR-2 (Document Quality)

**T-2: Design Change Scope**
- **Trade-off**: Minimal changes may not fully satisfy VFPA intent; comprehensive changes may exceed requirements
- **Guidance**: Engage VFPA to understand intent; consider whether broader changes provide value
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md IR-5 (Discipline Packages)

**T-3: Commitment Scope**
- **Trade-off**: Making commitments shows responsiveness but creates obligations; avoiding may prolong approval
- **Guidance**: Make clear, specific commitments with realistic schedules; avoid vague commitments; track and fulfill all
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-4 (Commitment Management), PR-3 (Commitment Fulfillment)

**T-4: Level of Supporting Detail**
- **Trade-off**: Extensive documentation demonstrates thoroughness but requires more effort; minimal may not satisfy VFPA
- **Guidance**: Provide documentation appropriate to complexity; comprehensive for complex comments, brief for simple
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md D-1 (Document Content)

**T-5: Regulatory Engagement Level**
- **Trade-off**: Proactive engagement improves alignment but requires time; minimal engagement more efficient but may misalign
- **Guidance**: Proactive engagement for complex comments; formal responses may suffice for straightforward
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md IR-6 (VFPA Coordination)

**T-6: Standard vs. Customized Responses**
- **Trade-off**: Standardized formats improve consistency; customized responses may better address concerns
- **Guidance**: Use standard comment tracking table; customize detailed response text for each comment
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md D-2 (Comment Tracking Table)

## Examples

**Reference examples and precedents:**

**E-1: Sample VFPA IP Review Comment and Response** — See Procedure.md Step 4.1

**VFPA Comment:** "The preliminary wharf design drawings do not show fender system details. Provide fender system design including fender type, capacity, deflection characteristics, and attachment details. Design shall accommodate berthing of Handymax vessels per the project description."

**D&B Contractor Response:**
"Fender system design has been developed and is included in the attached 60% design submission (Drawing MAR-101 Rev B, Calculation CALC-MAR-005 Rev A, Datasheet DS-MAR-002 Rev A). The fender system consists of Super Cone Fenders (SCN 1000) with UHMW-PE frontal pads, designed for Handymax vessel berthing per project requirements. Fender design has been verified by independent design verification (see IDV Report IDV-MARINE-60 Section 3.2). D&B Contractor commits to submit final fender fabrication drawings for VFPA review upon receipt from supplier (estimated [Date])."
