## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Design discipline):**

**P-1: Early Regulatory Engagement**
- VFPA In Principle (IP) Review is an early regulatory engagement process that provides VFPA feedback before significant design investment
- Early engagement identifies regulatory issues and requirements early, reducing risk of late-stage design changes
- IP Review is a collaborative regulatory process — VFPA provides guidance to support successful project delivery
- Effective IP Review responses demonstrate responsiveness to regulatory authority and facilitate smooth permitting
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Standard early regulatory engagement principles for port authority projects; Datasheet.md (IP Review purpose: early regulatory review)

**P-2: Regulatory Compliance as Project Foundation**
- VFPA approval is essential for project authorization — the facility is located on VFPA federal port lands
- Regulatory compliance (OBJ-6) underpins all design work — designs must meet VFPA requirements to proceed
- IP Review responses establish regulatory compliance roadmap for detailed design and construction
- Unresolved VFPA issues can delay or block project — responsive, complete IP Review responses are critical to schedule
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6; Section 1.1, Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal under VFPA jurisdiction); Specification.md (Standards section: VFPA regulatory authority)

**P-3: Comprehensive Response Approach**
- Every VFPA comment must be addressed — no comment can be ignored or deferred without explicit VFPA agreement
- Responses must be clear, complete, and technically sound — ambiguous or incomplete responses invite follow-up and delay
- Where design changes are required, responses must describe what changes are being made and how they address VFPA requirements
- Where commitments are made (e.g., future submittals, testing), they must be clearly documented and tracked
- **Source:** Specification.md (FR-1, FR-3, FR-4); **ASSUMPTION**: Regulatory response best practices

**P-4: Multi-Disciplinary Coordination**
- VFPA IP Review comments often span multiple disciplines (marine, environmental, operations, safety)
- Responses require coordination across design teams to ensure consistent, integrated approach
- Inter-discipline coordination (DEL-28.03) supports consistent responses to VFPA
- Design Coordination ensures VFPA requirements are addressed consistently in all discipline packages
- **Source:** Specification.md (FR-6, IR-3); Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (PKG-28 scope: inter-discipline coordination); Datasheet.md (review areas span multiple disciplines)

**P-5: Commitment Management**
- Commitments made to VFPA in IP Review responses are binding and must be fulfilled
- Commitment tracking is essential to ensure all commitments are completed on schedule
- Failure to fulfill commitments can damage relationship with VFPA and delay project approvals
- Commitment register provides visibility and accountability for commitment fulfillment
- **Source:** Specification.md (FR-4, PR-3); **ASSUMPTION**: Regulatory commitment management principles

**P-6: Environmental and Safety Focus**
- VFPA IP Review includes significant environmental review component — VFPA has federal environmental assessment authority
- Environmental compliance supports **OBJ-7: Environmental Protection** — "The Works include adequate containment, spill prevention, and environmental controls"
- Safety and security are VFPA priorities — federal port security requirements apply
- IP Review responses must demonstrate robust environmental and safety measures
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-7); Datasheet.md (review scope: environmental compliance, safety and security); Specification.md (IR-4)

**P-7: Integration with Terminal Operations**
- Fraser Surrey Terminal is an active commercial terminal — VFPA reviews compatibility with terminal operations
- IP Review addresses **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity** — "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities"
- Responses must demonstrate how design integrates with existing terminal operations and infrastructure
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-5); Datasheet.md (review scope: terminal operations integration)

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

**T-1: Response Speed vs. Response Quality**
- **Trade-off**: Fast response shows responsiveness but may result in incomplete or unclear responses requiring follow-up; slower, higher-quality response takes more time but may resolve comments in one cycle
- **Consideration**: Balance timeliness with completeness and quality
- **Guidance**: Establish realistic response schedule that allows for quality while meeting VFPA expectations; communicate with VFPA if additional time is needed for complex comments
- **Source:** Specification.md (PR-1: Response Timeliness, QR-2: Response Quality); Guidance.md (C-2, C-3)

**T-2: Design Change Scope**
- **Trade-off**: Minimal design changes addressing VFPA comments literally may not fully satisfy VFPA intent; more comprehensive design changes may exceed VFPA requirements but provide better long-term solution
- **Consideration**: VFPA comments may indicate broader concerns beyond specific comment text
- **Guidance**: Engage VFPA to understand intent behind comments; consider whether broader design changes provide value beyond VFPA compliance
- **Source:** Guidance.md (C-1: Understanding VFPA Comments, C-4: Design Change Management)

**T-3: Commitment Scope**
- **Trade-off**: Making commitments to VFPA shows responsiveness but creates obligations; avoiding commitments may prolong approval process
- **Consideration**: Commitments must be fulfilled — only commit to actions that are feasible and on schedule
- **Guidance**: Make clear, specific commitments with realistic schedules; avoid vague or open-ended commitments; track and fulfill all commitments
- **Source:** Specification.md (FR-4, PR-3); Guidance.md (P-5, C-5)

**T-4: Level of Supporting Detail**
- **Trade-off**: Extensive supporting documentation (drawings, calculations, reports) demonstrates thoroughness but requires more effort to prepare and review; minimal documentation is faster but may not satisfy VFPA
- **Consideration**: VFPA needs sufficient information to understand and accept responses
- **Guidance**: Provide supporting documentation appropriate to complexity and significance of comment; for complex technical comments, comprehensive documentation is warranted; for simple clarifications, brief responses may suffice
- **Source:** Specification.md (D-1: IP Review Response Document Content); Guidance.md (C-3: Response Quality and Completeness)

**T-5: Regulatory Engagement Level**
- **Trade-off**: Proactive engagement with VFPA (meetings, calls, draft responses) can improve alignment but requires time and effort; minimal engagement (formal responses only) is more efficient but may result in misalignment
- **Consideration**: VFPA relationship and project success benefit from collaborative engagement
- **Guidance**: For complex or contentious comments, proactive engagement is recommended; for straightforward comments, formal written responses may be sufficient
- **Source:** Specification.md (IR-6: VFPA Coordination); Guidance.md (C-1: Understanding VFPA Comments)

**T-6: Standard vs. Customized Responses**
- **Trade-off**: Standardized response formats and templates improve consistency and efficiency; customized responses tailored to each comment may better address VFPA concerns
- **Consideration**: Balance efficiency with effectiveness
- **Guidance**: Use standard comment tracking table format for consistency; customize detailed response text to address each comment specifically
- **Source:** Specification.md (D-2: Comment Tracking Table); Datasheet.md (IP review comment tracking table format)
