# Procedure: DEL-28.02 VFPA IP Review Responses

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for producing and managing **VFPA IP Review Responses** within **PKG-28 Design Verification**.

**Deliverable Purpose:** Documents analysis and results for VFPA IP review responses required for design verification and approvals, supporting **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** — "The Works comply with all permits, codes, and authority requirements."

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (DEL-28.02 description); Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6)
