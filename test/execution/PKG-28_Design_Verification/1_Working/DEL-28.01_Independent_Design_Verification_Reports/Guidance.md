## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Design discipline):**

**P-1: Independent Verification Principle**
- Independent Design Verification (IDV) provides an independent technical review of design work to verify compliance with codes, standards, and project requirements
- Independence is critical: IDV reviewers must be separate from the design team to provide objective verification
- IDV is a quality assurance mechanism, not a design activity — reviewers verify compliance but do not re-design
- **Source:** ISO 9001 quality management principles; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard IDV practice in D&B projects

**P-2: Risk-Based Verification**
- IDV focuses on high-risk design elements and code-critical items
- Critical structures, systems, and safety-related designs receive enhanced scrutiny
- **ASSUMPTION**: Risk-based approach typical for large infrastructure projects
- **TBD**: Specific risk classification criteria for this project

**P-3: Progressive Verification Through Design Stages**
- IDV is performed at multiple design stages (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC) to catch issues early
- Early-stage reviews (30%, 60%) focus on design basis, criteria, and major non-compliances
- Later-stage reviews (90%, IFC) focus on design completeness, detail compliance, and finding closures
- Progressive review reduces rework and ensures regulatory readiness
- **Source:** Datasheet.md (review stages: 30%, 60%, 90%, IFC); **ASSUMPTION**: Typical D&B progressive review approach

**P-4: Regulatory Compliance Focus**
- IDV directly supports **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** by verifying that designs meet all applicable codes, standards, and authority requirements
- IDV provides documented evidence of compliance for regulatory submissions and permit applications
- IDV helps identify and resolve compliance issues before submissions to authorities (VFPA, building officials, etc.)

**P-5: Coordination with Design Submission Process**
- IDV reports are coordinated with design submission packages (DEL-27.04: 30%, 60%, 90%, IFC packages)
- IDV review follows design completion at each stage and precedes formal submission to Employer and authorities
- IDV findings from one stage inform design refinements in subsequent stages
- **Source:** Specification.md (IR-1); Datasheet.md (related deliverable: DEL-27.04); **ASSUMPTION**: IDV integrated into submission workflow

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

**T-1: Review Depth vs. Schedule**
- **Trade-off**: Detailed, comprehensive IDV reviews improve quality but require more time
- **Consideration**: Balance review thoroughness with project schedule constraints
- **Guidance**: Establish minimum review requirements and focus detailed review on high-risk items
- **TBD**: Specific review depth requirements per stage and discipline
- **ASSUMPTION**: Risk-based review approach allows efficient allocation of review effort

**T-2: Reviewer Independence vs. Design Coordination**
- **Trade-off**: Strict independence ensures objective review but may create communication barriers with design teams
- **Consideration**: IDV reviewers must remain independent but also need to coordinate with design teams to clarify findings and verify closures
- **Guidance**: Establish clear communication protocols that maintain independence while enabling effective coordination
- **ASSUMPTION**: Structured finding/response process maintains independence while enabling collaboration

**T-3: Finding Severity Classification**
- **Trade-off**: Strict classification (many Critical findings) drives urgent action but may cause schedule disruption; lenient classification reduces urgency but may defer important issues
- **Consideration**: Establish clear, objective finding classification criteria
- **Guidance**: Critical findings should be limited to safety-critical and code-critical issues; use Major and Minor categories appropriately to prioritize without over-escalating
- **TBD**: Finding classification criteria and escalation protocol
- **ASSUMPTION**: Three-tier classification (Critical, Major, Minor) provides adequate granularity

**T-4: IDV Cost vs. Risk Mitigation**
- **Trade-off**: Comprehensive IDV across all disciplines and stages increases project cost but reduces risk of design deficiencies, rework, and regulatory non-compliance
- **Consideration**: IDV cost is typically small relative to potential cost of design errors, construction rework, and permit delays
- **Guidance**: IDV scope should be comprehensive for code-critical and high-risk disciplines; may be streamlined for low-risk elements
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance; OBJ-9: Lifecycle Cost Optimization)
- **ASSUMPTION**: IDV investment supports regulatory compliance and lifecycle cost optimization objectives

**T-5: Standardization vs. Discipline-Specific Needs**
- **Trade-off**: Standardized IDV processes and templates improve consistency but may not suit all discipline-specific requirements
- **Consideration**: Balance standardization (for efficiency and quality) with flexibility (to address discipline-specific codes and review needs)
- **Guidance**: Establish standard IDV process framework and report template; allow discipline-specific adaptations as needed
- **TBD**: Standard IDV templates and discipline-specific customization requirements
- **ASSUMPTION**: Framework standardization with discipline flexibility is optimal approach

**T-6: Progressive Review vs. Final Comprehensive Review**
- **Trade-off**: Progressive reviews at multiple stages (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC) catch issues early but require more review cycles; final comprehensive review at IFC reduces review cycles but defers issue identification
- **Consideration**: Early issue identification reduces rework cost and schedule impact
- **Guidance**: Progressive review at all major design stages is recommended for D&B projects
- **Source:** Datasheet.md (review stages: 30%, 60%, 90%, IFC); Specification.md (FR-2)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Progressive review is consistent with D&B best practices and supports regulatory compliance objective
