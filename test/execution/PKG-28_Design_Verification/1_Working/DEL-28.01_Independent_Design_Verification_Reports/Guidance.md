## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Design discipline):**

| Principle ID | Principle | Specification Req | Procedure Step |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| P-1 | Independent Verification Principle | FR-1, QR-1 | Step 1.2, Step 3.1 |
| P-2 | Risk-Based Verification | FR-4 | Step 3.1 |
| P-3 | Progressive Verification Through Design Stages | FR-2, FR-6 | Step 7 |
| P-4 | Regulatory Compliance Focus | FR-4, IR-2 | Step 3.1, Step 5.1 |
| P-5 | Coordination with Design Submission Process | IR-1 | Step 2 |

**P-1: Independent Verification Principle**
- Independent Design Verification (IDV) provides an independent technical review of design work to verify compliance with codes, standards, and project requirements
- Independence is critical: IDV reviewers must be separate from the design team to provide objective verification
- IDV is a quality assurance mechanism, not a design activity — reviewers verify compliance but do not re-design
- **Requirement linkage:** Supports Specification.md FR-1 (Independent Review), QR-1 (ISO 9001 Compliance)
- **Source:** ISO 9001 quality management principles; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard IDV practice in D&B projects

**P-2: Risk-Based Verification**
- IDV focuses on high-risk design elements and code-critical items
- Critical structures, systems, and safety-related designs receive enhanced scrutiny
- **Requirement linkage:** Supports Specification.md FR-4 (Compliance Verification)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Risk-based approach typical for large infrastructure projects
- **TBD**: Specific risk classification criteria for this project

**P-3: Progressive Verification Through Design Stages**
- IDV is performed at multiple design stages (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC) to catch issues early
- Early-stage reviews (30%, 60%) focus on design basis, criteria, and major non-compliances
- Later-stage reviews (90%, IFC) focus on design completeness, detail compliance, and finding closures
- Progressive review reduces rework and ensures regulatory readiness
- **Requirement linkage:** Supports Specification.md FR-2 (Stage Coverage), FR-6 (Closure Verification)
- **Source:** Datasheet.md (Attributes: Review Stages); **ASSUMPTION**: Typical D&B progressive review approach

**P-4: Regulatory Compliance Focus**
- IDV directly supports **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** by verifying that designs meet all applicable codes, standards, and authority requirements
- IDV provides documented evidence of compliance for regulatory submissions and permit applications
- IDV helps identify and resolve compliance issues before submissions to authorities (VFPA, building officials, etc.)
- **Requirement linkage:** Supports Specification.md FR-4 (Compliance Verification), IR-2 (Regulatory Submissions)
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6; PKG-28 scope)

**P-5: Coordination with Design Submission Process**
- IDV reports are coordinated with design submission packages (DEL-27.04: 30%, 60%, 90%, IFC packages)
- IDV review follows design completion at each stage and precedes formal submission to Employer and authorities
- IDV findings from one stage inform design refinements in subsequent stages
- **Requirement linkage:** Supports Specification.md IR-1 (Design Submission Packages)
- **Source:** Datasheet.md (Cross-Deliverable Coordination); **ASSUMPTION**: IDV integrated into submission workflow

**Applicable standards context:**

| Standard | Application | Specification § |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| ISO 9001 | Quality Management Systems | QR-1 |
| Employer's Requirements | IDV requirements | FR-4 |
| EGBC Practice Standards | BC professional practice | PR-3 |
| Discipline-specific codes | Verified during IDV | FR-4 |

**TBD:** Complete standards list per discipline

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

| Trade-off ID | Trade-off | Considerations | Specification Req |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| T-1 | Review Depth vs. Schedule | Thoroughness vs. time constraints | PR-1, PR-2 |
| T-2 | Reviewer Independence vs. Design Coordination | Objectivity vs. communication | FR-1, IR-4 |
| T-3 | Finding Severity Classification | Urgency vs. appropriate prioritization | FR-5 |
| T-4 | IDV Cost vs. Risk Mitigation | Investment vs. risk reduction | OBJ-6, OBJ-9 |
| T-5 | Standardization vs. Discipline-Specific Needs | Consistency vs. flexibility | FR-3 |
| T-6 | Progressive Review vs. Final Review | Early issue identification vs. review efficiency | FR-2 |

**T-1: Review Depth vs. Schedule**
- **Trade-off**: Detailed, comprehensive IDV reviews improve quality but require more time
- **Consideration**: Balance review thoroughness with project schedule constraints
- **Guidance**: Establish minimum review requirements and focus detailed review on high-risk items
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md PR-1 (Review Completeness), PR-2 (Timeliness)
- **TBD**: Specific review depth requirements per stage and discipline

**T-2: Reviewer Independence vs. Design Coordination**
- **Trade-off**: Strict independence ensures objective review but may create communication barriers with design teams
- **Consideration**: IDV reviewers must remain independent but also need to coordinate with design teams to clarify findings and verify closures
- **Guidance**: Establish clear communication protocols that maintain independence while enabling effective coordination
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-1 (Independent Review), IR-4 (Design Team Coordination)

**T-3: Finding Severity Classification**
- **Trade-off**: Strict classification drives urgent action but may cause schedule disruption; lenient classification reduces urgency but may defer important issues
- **Consideration**: Establish clear, objective finding classification criteria
- **Guidance**: Critical findings should be limited to safety-critical and code-critical issues; use Major and Minor categories appropriately
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-5 (Finding Documentation)
- **TBD**: Finding classification criteria and escalation protocol

**T-4: IDV Cost vs. Risk Mitigation**
- **Trade-off**: Comprehensive IDV increases project cost but reduces risk of design deficiencies, rework, and regulatory non-compliance
- **Consideration**: IDV cost is typically small relative to potential cost of design errors, construction rework, and permit delays
- **Guidance**: IDV scope should be comprehensive for code-critical and high-risk disciplines; may be streamlined for low-risk elements
- **Requirement linkage:** OBJ-6 (Regulatory Compliance), OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization)
- **Source:** Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (Section 2, OBJ-6, OBJ-9)

**T-5: Standardization vs. Discipline-Specific Needs**
- **Trade-off**: Standardized IDV processes improve consistency but may not suit all discipline-specific requirements
- **Consideration**: Balance standardization (for efficiency) with flexibility (for discipline-specific needs)
- **Guidance**: Establish standard IDV process framework and report template; allow discipline-specific adaptations as needed
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-3 (Discipline Coverage)
- **TBD**: Standard IDV templates and discipline-specific customization requirements

**T-6: Progressive Review vs. Final Comprehensive Review**
- **Trade-off**: Progressive reviews at multiple stages catch issues early but require more review cycles; final review at IFC reduces cycles but defers issue identification
- **Consideration**: Early issue identification reduces rework cost and schedule impact
- **Guidance**: Progressive review at all major design stages is recommended for D&B projects
- **Requirement linkage:** Specification.md FR-2 (Stage Coverage)
