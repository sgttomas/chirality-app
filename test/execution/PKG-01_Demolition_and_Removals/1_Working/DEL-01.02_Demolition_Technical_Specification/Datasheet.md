## Conditions

**Project Context:**

- **Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1.1 Project Context.
- **Demolition scope:** Track 6 (rail infrastructure), Dolphin 2 (marine structure), perimeter fencing, salt tent dismantling, and associated decommissioning activities. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope.
- **Interface boundaries:** Employer-responsible items (permits, nitrogen skid) excluded except interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus.
- **Terminal operations:** Demolition must maintain terminal operational continuity. ASSUMPTION: applicable to project operational objectives.

**Operating and Environmental Conditions:**

- **Site conditions:** Active terminal environment with ongoing rail and marine operations; demolition work must coordinate with terminal scheduling and access constraints. ASSUMPTION: typical for terminal demolition work.
- **Environmental compliance:** BC and federal environmental regulations apply (disposal, contaminated materials, dust/noise control). TBD: specific environmental permit requirements from ER volumes.
- **Safety requirements:** WorkSafeBC regulations apply; marine work safety standards apply to Dolphin 2 demolition. ASSUMPTION: BC location and work type; specific requirements TBD.
- **Hazardous materials:** Presence of asbestos, lead paint, or contaminated materials may govern demolition methods and disposal. TBD: hazardous materials survey results.
- **Weather and seasonal constraints:** Pacific Northwest climate; wet weather and winter work windows may affect scheduling and methods. ASSUMPTION: typical for BC coastal location; specific constraints TBD.

## Construction

**Specification Content (per anticipated artifacts):**

- **Demolition specification:** Technical requirements for performance, materials, and workmanship covering all PKG-01 scope items. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.
  - Performance requirements: demolition methods, sequencing constraints, safety performance criteria, interface coordination performance
  - Materials requirements: temporary works materials, protection materials, disposal container/equipment specifications
  - Workmanship requirements: execution standards, quality control criteria, inspection requirements, completion criteria
- **Disposal requirements:** Waste management and disposal specifications. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.
  - Material segregation and classification (concrete, steel, wood, hazardous materials)
  - Disposal/recycling requirements and prohibited disposal methods
  - Documentation requirements (manifests, certificates, tracking)
  - Environmental compliance requirements

**Specification Structure (typical sections):**

TBD: Specific section numbering and organization per project specification template; typical structure:

1. **General:**  Scope, references, submittals, quality assurance, closeout documentation
2. **Products:** Materials for temporary works, protection measures (if applicable)
3. **Execution:** Demolition methods, sequencing, protection measures, waste handling, disposal procedures, testing/inspection, completion criteria
4. **Disposal:** Waste classification, segregation, manifesting, recycling requirements, disposal site requirements

**Cross-References:**

- References DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set for spatial limits, phasing, and disposal routing. ASSUMPTION: drawings provide "where," specification provides "how."
- References DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures for detailed method statements and safety procedures. ASSUMPTION: specification sets requirements, procedures define implementation.
- Interfaces with DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation & Test Records for inspection and completion verification criteria.
