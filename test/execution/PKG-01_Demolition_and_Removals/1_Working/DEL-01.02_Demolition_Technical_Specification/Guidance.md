# Guidance: DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification

## Purpose

Provide a technical specification that:

1. Defines clear, verifiable, and enforceable requirements for demolition performance, materials, workmanship, and disposal for all PKG-01 scope items.
2. Translates Employer's Requirements (ER) and applicable codes/standards into executable technical requirements for Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, and salt tent demolition.
3. Establishes quality control criteria and completion standards that support inspection and verification per DEL-01.04.
4. Provides performance-based requirements that allow contractor flexibility in execution methods (detailed in DEL-01.03) while ensuring safety, quality, and environmental compliance.
5. Serves as the contractual technical reference for demolition work quality and acceptance.

## Principles

**Clarity and Enforceability:**

- **Requirements must be verifiable:** Every requirement in the specification should be objectively verifiable through inspection, testing, or document review. Avoid subjective terms like "adequate" or "satisfactory" without defining measurable criteria. ASSUMPTION: fundamental specification writing principle; supports quality control and contract enforcement.
- **Requirements must be mandatory:** Use "shall" for mandatory requirements, "should" for recommendations, and "may" for permissible options. Avoid ambiguous terms like "as required" or "where necessary" without defining the trigger conditions. ASSUMPTION: standard specification language convention.
- **Single point of truth:** Each requirement should appear in one deliverable only to avoid conflicts. Specification defines "what" and "how well"; DEL-01.01 defines "where"; DEL-01.03 defines "how to." ASSUMPTION: multi-deliverable package coherence principle.

**Traceability and Compliance:**

- **ER requirements traceability:** All specification requirements must be traceable to ER requirements, applicable codes/standards, or documented project decisions. Use requirements traceability matrix to demonstrate compliance. Source: decomposition DEL-01.02 description (requirements per ER); ASSUMPTION: traceability supports approval and audit.
- **Code and standard compliance:** Reference applicable codes and standards by title and edition; extract and restate requirements in specification language rather than simply referencing standards (to avoid interpretation disputes). ASSUMPTION: standard specification practice; specific approach TBD based on ER and project legal requirements.
- **Interface requirements clarity:** Interface coordination requirements with Employer-responsible items must be explicit, including notification protocols, protection responsibilities, and acceptance criteria. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (interface coordination required).

**Safety and Environmental Protection:**

- **Safety is paramount:** Safety requirements must address all identified hazards (structural stability during demolition, fall protection, marine work safety, utility strikes, dust/noise exposure, hazardous materials). Safety performance criteria must meet or exceed WorkSafeBC and applicable safety standards. ASSUMPTION: safety priority aligns with project objectives; WorkSafeBC compliance mandatory for BC project.
- **Environmental compliance:** Environmental performance requirements must address all applicable BC and federal regulations, including waste disposal, contaminated materials handling, dust/noise control, erosion and sediment control, and spill prevention. ASSUMPTION: environmental compliance mandatory; specific requirements TBD pending environmental permits.
- **Operational continuity:** Requirements must consider terminal operational continuity, including phasing to maintain access, coordination with rail and marine operations, and minimization of disruption. Source: decomposition Section 1.1 (terminal location) and ASSUMPTION: operational continuity objective applies to demolition work.

**Constructability and Flexibility:**

- **Performance-based where possible:** Where multiple acceptable demolition methods exist, specify performance criteria rather than prescriptive methods to allow contractor flexibility and innovation. Reserve prescriptive requirements for cases where method selection is safety-critical or constrained by site conditions. ASSUMPTION: performance-based approach common in D&B contracts; balance TBD based on ER and risk tolerance.
- **Constructability consideration:** Requirements should be achievable with standard demolition equipment and methods appropriate for the structure type and site constraints. Unusual or specialized requirements should be identified early and justified. ASSUMPTION: standard constructability principle.
- **Field adaptation allowance:** Specification should allow for field adaptation when unexpected conditions are encountered (hidden utilities, structural conditions different from as-builts) through defined approval processes (RFI, site instruction, etc.). ASSUMPTION: typical for demolition work in existing facilities; process TBD.

**Integration with Package Deliverables:**

- **Drawing coordination:** Specification requirements must coordinate with DEL-01.01 demolition drawings. Specification defines quality and performance; drawings define limits and phasing. Changes to specification may trigger drawing updates and vice versa. Cross-reference: Specification R23.
- **Procedure coordination:** Specification requirements must be implementable using methods described in DEL-01.03 demolition procedures. If specification introduces new performance criteria, DEL-01.03 may need corresponding method statements. Cross-reference: Specification V14.
- **Inspection coordination:** Quality control requirements and completion criteria in specification must align with inspection record formats in DEL-01.04. Inspection hold points, test requirements, and acceptance criteria must be measurable using DEL-01.04 methods. Cross-reference: Specification R15, V12, V13.

## Considerations

**Technical Scope Considerations:**

- **Structure-specific requirements:** Different demolition methods and safety considerations apply to different structure types:
  - **Track 6 (rail infrastructure):** Coordination with rail operations, track removal sequencing, ballast and tie disposal, potential contaminated ballast (creosote, petroleum products).
  - **Dolphin 2 (marine structure):** Marine safety requirements, tide and weather coordination, marine equipment access, potential marine contamination, structural stability during partial removal.
  - **Salt tent:** Building demolition methods, potential hazardous materials (asbestos roofing, lead paint), equipment access constraints, debris management in confined area.
  - **Fencing:** Simple removal methods, minimal safety concerns, recycling potential for metal fencing.
  - ASSUMPTION: structure-specific considerations inform specification requirements; TBD: specific requirements based on existing condition assessments and demolition engineering.

**Regulatory and Permitting Considerations:**

- **Disposal regulations:** Different waste types have different regulatory requirements. Concrete and steel may be recycled with minimal oversight; hazardous materials require licensed contractors, manifesting, and certified disposal sites. Specification must address all waste types present in PKG-01 scope. TBD: waste types and quantities from hazardous materials survey and existing structure assessment.
- **Environmental permits:** Demolition may require air quality permits (dust control), water quality permits (if marine demolition affects water), or contaminated site protocols. Specification requirements must align with permit conditions. TBD: permit requirements from ER and environmental assessment.
- **Marine approvals:** Dolphin 2 demolition may require approvals from Transport Canada, port authority, or environmental agencies for marine work. Specification must address marine safety and environmental protection requirements. TBD: approvals required and specific requirements from ER and agency coordination.
- **Occupational health and safety compliance:** WorkSafeBC notification and compliance requirements for demolition, confined spaces (if applicable), hazardous materials, and marine work. Specification must reference applicable WorkSafeBC requirements and define compliance verification methods. ASSUMPTION: WorkSafeBC compliance mandatory; specific notification and inspection requirements TBD.

**Site and Operational Constraints:**

- **Active terminal environment:** Specification requirements must address working in an active terminal with ongoing operations, including access restrictions, work windows, noise/dust limits, traffic control, and coordination protocols with terminal management. ASSUMPTION: significant constraint for terminal demolition; specific requirements TBD from terminal operations input.
- **Equipment access and staging:** Demolition equipment size and reach may be constrained by site access, overhead clearances, adjacent structures, and staging area availability. Specification should allow for equipment-specific method selection within performance criteria. TBD: equipment constraints from site assessment.
- **Utility protection:** Active utilities (electrical, water, gas, communications) may be present near demolition areas. Specification must require utility locates, protection measures, and coordination protocols. TBD: utility locations from utility locate survey and interface coordination.
- **Weather and seasonal constraints:** Pacific Northwest wet weather may affect demolition methods (dust control vs. mud/erosion control), equipment access (ground bearing capacity), and work windows (marine work in winter storms). Specification should address seasonal constraints or allow for seasonal method adaptation. ASSUMPTION: weather constraints typical for BC coastal location; specific requirements TBD.

**Quality and Acceptance Considerations:**

- **Inspection hold points:** Specification should define key inspection points such as pre-demolition survey, phase completion verification, final completion inspection, and special inspections for safety-critical operations (e.g., marine work, heavy lifting). ASSUMPTION: inspection at key phases supports quality control and risk management; specific hold points TBD.
- **Completion criteria definition:** "Complete" must be clearly defined for each demolition item: removed to specified limit, debris cleared, surface prepared to specified condition (e.g., graded to elevation, cleaned to existing surface), and documented per DEL-01.04. Ambiguous completion criteria lead to disputes. ASSUMPTION: clear completion criteria essential for contract closeout.
- **Non-conformance handling:** Specification should address how non-conforming work is identified, documented, and resolved (repair, accept with concession, reject and re-do). ASSUMPTION: standard quality control process; specific procedures TBD from project quality plan.

**Cost and Schedule Considerations:**

- **Disposal cost impact:** Disposal requirements significantly affect demolition cost. Specification choices around segregation (labor-intensive but enables recycling), manifesting (administrative cost), and disposal facility requirements (certified facilities may be more expensive) should consider cost-benefit trade-offs. ASSUMPTION: recycling reduces disposal cost but increases labor; balance TBD based on ER requirements and project priorities.
- **Hazardous materials impact:** If hazardous materials are present (asbestos, lead, contaminated soil), specification must require licensed contractors, specialized handling, and certified disposal, which significantly increase cost and schedule. Early hazardous materials survey is critical to avoid surprises. TBD: hazardous materials presence and extent from survey.
- **Access and mobilization:** Requirements that constrain equipment access or require multiple mobilizations (e.g., marine equipment for Dolphin 2, rail equipment for Track 6) increase cost. Specification should allow flexibility where feasible. ASSUMPTION: cost consideration in specification trade-offs; specific constraints TBD.

## Trade-offs

**Prescriptive vs. Performance-Based Requirements:**

- **Prescriptive specification:** Defines specific demolition methods, equipment, and procedures. Provides clear direction and reduces risk of unacceptable methods, but limits contractor flexibility, may not suit unexpected conditions, and may increase cost if specified methods are inefficient.
- **Performance-based specification:** Defines required outcomes (safety, quality, completion criteria) and allows contractor to select methods. Enables contractor innovation and cost optimization, but requires robust verification methods and may increase risk if contractor selects marginal methods.
- **Consideration:** Use performance-based approach for routine demolition (fencing, portions of salt tent) where multiple acceptable methods exist. Use prescriptive approach for safety-critical or site-constrained work (Dolphin 2 marine demolition, Track 6 near active rail) where method selection significantly affects safety or coordination. ASSUMPTION: hybrid approach common; specific balance TBD based on ER and risk assessment.

**Segregation vs. Mixed Disposal:**

- **High segregation:** Requires separation of concrete, steel, wood, hazardous materials, and other waste types on-site. Enables maximum recycling and may reduce disposal cost, but increases labor cost for sorting and staging area requirements for multiple waste streams. Supports environmental objectives.
- **Low segregation (mixed waste):** Allows combined disposal of non-hazardous waste (concrete and wood together). Reduces labor cost and staging complexity, but increases disposal cost (mixed waste typically not recyclable, higher disposal fees) and may not meet ER or regulatory recycling requirements.
- **Consideration:** Minimum segregation level is typically driven by ER requirements or regulatory minimums (hazardous materials must be segregated). Additional segregation is cost-benefit trade-off: recycling cost savings vs. labor cost increase. TBD: segregation requirements from ER and waste management plan; cost-benefit analysis recommended.

**Inspection Intensity vs. Efficiency:**

- **High inspection intensity:** Multiple inspection hold points, detailed documentation, and independent verification at each phase. Provides high confidence in quality and compliance, but increases inspection cost, administrative burden, and potential for schedule delays waiting for inspections.
- **Low inspection intensity:** Minimal hold points (pre-demo, final completion), reliance on contractor self-inspection and spot-checking. Reduces cost and schedule impact, but increases risk of non-conformance not being detected until later (more expensive to correct).
- **Consideration:** Inspection intensity should be risk-based. High-risk operations (marine work, work near active rail, hazardous materials) warrant more inspection. Routine work (fencing removal) may require minimal inspection. ASSUMPTION: risk-based inspection common practice; specific inspection plan TBD from project quality plan and risk assessment.

**Recycling Requirements vs. Disposal Flexibility:**

- **Mandatory recycling with high targets:** Specification requires minimum recycling rates (e.g., 75% of concrete and steel must be recycled) and approved recycling facilities. Supports environmental objectives and may align with ER or permit requirements, but constrains contractor disposal approach and may increase cost if recycling markets are unfavorable.
- **Flexible disposal with recycling encouraged:** Specification allows contractor to select disposal approach (recycling or landfill) based on cost and feasibility, with recycling encouraged but not mandated. Reduces cost and allows adaptation to market conditions, but may result in lower recycling rates and may not meet ER environmental objectives.
- **Consideration:** Recycling requirements are typically driven by ER, environmental permits, or project sustainability goals. If recycling is not mandated, consider cost-benefit and environmental objectives when setting requirements. TBD: recycling requirements from ER and environmental permits; market conditions for recycled concrete/steel in Fraser Surrey area.

**Temporary Works Responsibility:**

- **Specification defines temporary works:** Specification includes detailed requirements for shoring, bracing, scaffolding, and other temporary works required for safe demolition. Provides clear direction and ensures adequate temporary works, but increases specification complexity and may constrain contractor's means and methods.
- **Temporary works are contractor's responsibility:** Specification sets performance requirements (maintain stability, protect adjacent structures, ensure worker safety) and leaves temporary works design to contractor. Simplifies specification and allows contractor expertise, but requires robust performance criteria and verification methods to ensure adequate temporary works.
- **Consideration:** Temporary works responsibility is often defined by contract type. D&B contracts typically assign temporary works to contractor with specification setting performance requirements. If specific temporary works are critical (e.g., Dolphin 2 partial removal requires marine falsework), specification may need to be more prescriptive. ASSUMPTION: contractor responsible for temporary works means and methods; specification sets performance criteria. Specific approach TBD from ER and contract terms.
