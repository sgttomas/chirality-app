# Guidance: DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification

## Purpose

Define the performance, materials, workmanship, and disposal requirements for demolition in PKG-01. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.02 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

- Requirements should be clear, verifiable, and traceable to Employer's Requirements. Source: decomposition DEL-01.02 description; ER volumes not available here (location TBD).
- Specification should reflect PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent dismantling). Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).
- Maintain contractor scope boundaries and interface-only connections to Employer-responsible items. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Considerations

- Disposal requirements may be governed by permits and regulatory conditions. TBD pending reference documents.
- Environmental controls and contamination handling requirements are unknown until ER volumes are provided. TBD.
- Objective mapping does not list PKG-01; alignment to project objectives is TBD pending human confirmation.

## Trade-offs

- Specificity vs. flexibility for field execution. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.
- Minimum compliance vs. best-practice requirements. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.

## Examples

- TBD (no example specifications available in references).

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

- None identified from available sources.
