# Procedure: DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification

## Purpose

Produce the demolition technical specification defining performance, materials, workmanship, and disposal requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.02 entry (location TBD).

## Prerequisites

- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements volumes and any regulatory/permit requirements (not provided in _REFERENCES.md). TBD.
- **Inputs:** PKG-01 scope description for demolition and removals. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).

## Steps

ASSUMPTION: Steps below reflect a typical specification production workflow; adjust to project procedures when available.

1. Collect reference inputs (ER volumes, permits, environmental requirements, existing condition reports). TBD until references are provided.
2. Define specification structure and sections (performance, materials, workmanship, disposal). Source: _CONTEXT.md.
3. Draft requirements for demolition performance, materials, and workmanship. Source: _CONTEXT.md; details TBD.
4. Draft disposal requirements and waste handling provisions. Source: _CONTEXT.md; details TBD.
5. Review for scope coverage (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).
6. Perform internal QC and issue controlled specification. ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control workflow.

## Verification

- Check that all requirement categories are addressed (performance, materials, workmanship, disposal). ASSUMPTION based on _CONTEXT.md.
- Verify ER alignment once ER volumes are available. TBD.

## Records

- Issued demolition technical specification (controlled revisions).
- Review comments and responses. ASSUMPTION: standard document control practice.

## References

- _CONTEXT.md (DEL-01.02).
- _DEPENDENCIES.md (NOT_TRACKED).
- Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-01 scope, DEL-01.02 entry, Scope Focus; location TBD).
- _REFERENCES.md indicates no references identified yet.
