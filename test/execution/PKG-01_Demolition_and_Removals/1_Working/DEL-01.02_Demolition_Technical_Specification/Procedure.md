# Procedure: DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification

## Purpose

Produce the DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification, defining performance, materials, workmanship, and disposal requirements for PKG-01 demolition operations (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent) in accordance with Employer's Requirements and applicable codes/standards.

This procedure describes both:
1. **Production process:** How to produce the demolition technical specification deliverable.
2. **Usage guidance:** How the completed specification is used during demolition execution and verification.

Source: _CONTEXT.md, decomposition DEL-01.02 entry, and ASSUMPTION: dual-use procedure scope per 4_DOCUMENTS protocol.

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:**

- Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md for tracking mode). ASSUMPTION: DEL-01.02 specification typically developed concurrently with or following DEL-01.01 drawings (to reference spatial limits) and preceding DEL-01.03 procedures (which implement specification requirements), but sequencing is human-managed.

**Required Reference Materials:**

The following inputs are required to produce the specification but are not currently available in _REFERENCES.md (TBD):

- **Employer's Requirements (ER) volumes:** Demolition scope definition, performance criteria, technical standards, environmental requirements, disposal requirements, acceptance criteria. Source: decomposition references ER Volume 2 Parts 1-3; location TBD.
- **Applicable codes and standards:** WorkSafeBC regulations, BC Building Code demolition provisions, BC Environmental Management Act, Transport Canada marine safety regulations, applicable CSA or other material/method standards. TBD: specific code editions and sections.
- **DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set:** Spatial limits, phasing, disposal routing to cross-reference in specification. ASSUMPTION: drawings define "where," specification defines "what" and "how well"; coordination required.
- **Existing condition assessments:** Structural assessments of items to be demolished (structural type, materials, condition); hazardous materials survey (asbestos, lead, contaminated soils); utility locate survey. TBD: existing condition documentation availability.
- **Environmental permits and approvals:** Environmental permit conditions, disposal facility requirements, recycling requirements. TBD: environmental permits and regulatory requirements.
- **Project specification template:** Standard specification format, section numbering system (CSI MasterFormat or project-specific), template sections, boilerplate language. TBD: project specification standard.
- **Project quality and safety plans:** Quality control procedures, inspection requirements, safety performance criteria, non-conformance handling procedures. TBD: project QA/QC and safety plan requirements.

**Scope Definition:**

- **Package scope:** Demolition and disposal of Track 6 (rail infrastructure), Dolphin 2 (marine structure), perimeter fencing, salt tent dismantling, and associated decommissioning. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope.
- **Interface boundaries:** Exclude Employer-responsible items (permits, nitrogen skid) except interface coordination requirements. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus.

## Steps

**Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Analysis**

**Step 1.1: Extract ER Requirements**
- Obtain and review Employer's Requirements (ER) volumes. Extract all demolition-related requirements including scope, performance criteria, technical standards, environmental requirements, disposal requirements, and acceptance criteria. TBD: ER availability.
- Create requirements traceability matrix linking ER requirements to specification sections (to be developed). Document ER requirement ID, requirement text, and target specification section. ASSUMPTION: traceability matrix supports ER compliance demonstration.
- Identify and document any ambiguities, conflicts, or gaps in ER requirements for resolution via RFI or coordination process.
- **Verification:** Confirm all demolition-related ER requirements are captured in traceability matrix; confirm RFIs submitted for ambiguities.

**Step 1.2: Review Applicable Codes and Standards**
- Identify applicable codes and standards for PKG-01 demolition work based on project location (Fraser Surrey, BC), work type (structural demolition, marine work, hazardous materials if present), and ER references.
- Obtain current editions of identified codes and standards. Extract applicable requirements and translate into specification language (restate requirements rather than simply referencing standards, to avoid interpretation disputes).
- Document code/standard applicability and key requirements in standards register. ASSUMPTION: standards register supports verification and audit.
- **Verification:** Confirm all applicable codes/standards identified and current editions obtained; confirm extracted requirements are accurately restated in specification language.

**Step 1.3: Coordinate with Related Deliverables**
- Review DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set (if available) to understand spatial limits, phasing, and disposal routing that specification will reference. Identify where specification needs to cross-reference drawings.
- Identify where specification requirements will need implementation methods in DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures (e.g., performance-based requirements that allow method flexibility, safety-critical operations requiring detailed procedures).
- Identify where specification defines inspection/acceptance criteria that DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation & Test Records will verify (inspection hold points, completion criteria, test requirements if any).
- Document cross-deliverable coordination requirements and cross-reference points.
- **Verification:** Confirm cross-deliverable coordination points identified; confirm clear division of content (specification = requirements, drawings = spatial, procedures = methods, records = verification).

**Step 1.4: Assess Structure-Specific Requirements**
- For each PKG-01 structure type (Track 6 rail, Dolphin 2 marine, salt tent building, fencing), assess:
  - Structural type and demolition method constraints
  - Site access and equipment constraints
  - Safety considerations (structural stability, fall protection, marine safety, utility protection)
  - Environmental considerations (hazardous materials, disposal requirements, dust/noise control)
  - Operational coordination requirements (rail operations, marine traffic, terminal access)
- Document structure-specific requirements and considerations. ASSUMPTION: structure-specific requirements inform specification performance and safety criteria.
- **Verification:** Confirm all PKG-01 structures assessed; confirm structure-specific requirements documented for specification development.

**Step 2.3: Draft Products Requirements (Part 2, if applicable)**
- If specification includes materials requirements for temporary works, protection materials, or disposal equipment, draft Part 2 Products sections.
- For each material/product category:
  - Define performance requirements (strength, durability, safety ratings)
  - Reference applicable material standards (CSA, ASTM, etc.)
  - Define submittal requirements (product data, certifications)
  - Define quality control requirements (testing, inspection)
- ASSUMPTION: Part 2 may be minimal or omitted for demolition specification (focus is execution); include if ER or safety requirements mandate specific materials.
- **Verification:** Check that material/product requirements are necessary (not contractor means and methods); check that requirements are verifiable and traceable to ER or code requirements.

**Step 2.4: Draft Execution Requirements (Part 3)**
- Draft Section 3.1 Preparation including pre-demolition survey, utility locates, interface coordination, protection measures, site mobilization.
- Draft Section 3.2 Demolition Methods (general) defining acceptable/prohibited methods, performance criteria (structural stability, dust control, noise limits), and safety requirements. Use performance-based language where flexibility is appropriate (per Guidance trade-offs).

## Verification

**Specification Content Verification (per Specification requirements):**

- **V1-V5:** Verify specification includes all required content categories (performance, materials, workmanship, disposal requirements) covering all PKG-01 scope items and aligning with ER. Methods: content completeness checklist, scope coverage matrix, ER traceability matrix.
- **V6-V10:** Verify technical requirements are feasible, consistent with drawings/procedures, and compliant with safety/environmental regulations. Methods: constructability review, cross-document consistency checks, regulatory compliance checklists.

**Cross-Document Verification:**

- **V11:** Verify specification coordinates with DEL-01.01 drawings with clear division of content (specification = requirements, drawings = spatial limits/phasing).
- **V12-V13:** Verify specification inspection/completion criteria align with DEL-01.04 record formats and are measurable/verifiable.
- **V14:** Verify specification requirements are implementable using DEL-01.03 procedures (or identify gaps for DEL-01.03 development).

**Format and Approval Verification:**

- **V15-V17:** Verify specification format, standards currency, and document control compliance.
- **V18-V19:** Verify all internal and external review comments addressed and approvals obtained.

## Records

**Deliverable Records:**

- **Issued Demolition Technical Specification:** Complete specification document with controlled revision tracking, document status, and distribution records. Maintained in project document control system.
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** Links ER requirements to specification sections demonstrating ER compliance. Updated with each specification revision.
- **Standards and Codes Register:** Lists all referenced standards/codes with titles, editions, and applicability notes.

- **RFI records:** RFIs issued to clarify ER requirements, resolve ambiguities, or obtain missing information during specification development.

---

**Usage During Execution:**

Once issued, the demolition technical specification serves as:

- **Contractual technical reference:** Defines required quality, performance, and acceptance criteria for PKG-01 demolition work.
- **Basis for DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures:** Procedures implement specification requirements with detailed methods.
- **Basis for DEL-01.04 Inspection/Verification:** Inspection records verify compliance with specification requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Reference for subcontractor qualifications:** Defines required contractor qualifications, certifications, and submittals.
- **Reference for waste management:** Defines disposal requirements that waste management contractor must meet.

Specification changes during execution (via change orders or field modifications) must be processed through project change control procedures and may trigger updates to DEL-01.01, DEL-01.03, and DEL-01.04.
