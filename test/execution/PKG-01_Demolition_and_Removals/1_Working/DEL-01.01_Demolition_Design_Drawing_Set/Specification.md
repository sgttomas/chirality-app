**Exclusions:**

- Employer-responsible items including permits obtained by Employer and nitrogen skid supply (except interface connections). Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus.
- Design of new permanent works (covered in other packages).
- Detailed disposal site operations (off-site disposal operations are contractor's responsibility but not detailed in these drawings).

**Technical Requirements:**

- **R11:** Demolition limits shall be clearly delineated and dimensioned relative to existing structures and property boundaries. ASSUMPTION: standard demolition design practice; ER requirements TBD.
- **R12:** Temporary works required to support demolition operations (shoring, bracing, protection) shall be indicated. ASSUMPTION: typical for demolition involving structural elements; specific requirements TBD.
- **R13:** Drawings shall reference DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification for materials, methods, and quality requirements. ASSUMPTION: standard cross-referencing between drawings and specifications.
- **R14:** Safety-critical items and special procedures shall be clearly noted on the drawings. ASSUMPTION: aligned with project safety objectives; specific noting requirements TBD.

## Standards

**Design and Drawing Standards:**

- Project CAD standard (layers, symbols, line types, file formats). TBD: specific standard reference.
- Applicable civil engineering drawing standards (dimension conventions, annotation standards, sheet layouts). TBD: project drawing standard or default to recognized industry practice.
- ASSUMPTION: British Columbia and Canadian regulatory requirements apply given project location (Fraser Surrey, BC).

**Demolition-Specific Standards:**

- Applicable demolition codes and standards for structural demolition, hazardous materials handling, and disposal. TBD pending ER volumes and reference documents.
- Environmental protection and waste management regulations applicable to demolition and disposal operations. TBD: BC and federal environmental requirements.
- Occupational health and safety regulations for demolition operations (WorkSafeBC). ASSUMPTION: applicable given BC location; specific requirements TBD.

## Verification

**Content Verification:**

- **V1:** Verify inclusion of all required drawing types: demolition plans (R2), removal sequence drawings (R3), and disposal location plans (R4). Method: drawing set index review and visual inspection.
- **V2:** Verify complete coverage of all PKG-01 scope items: Track 6 rail infrastructure, Dolphin 2 marine structure, perimeter fencing, and salt tent dismantling (R5). Method: scope compliance checklist cross-referenced to drawings.
- **V3:** Verify all interface connections to Employer-responsible items are identified with coordination requirements clearly noted (R6). Method: interface register cross-check; TBD pending interface coordination process.
- **V4:** Verify demolition limits are clearly delineated, dimensioned, and coordinated with existing conditions (R11). Method: drawing review against existing condition surveys; TBD pending survey availability.
- **V5:** Verify alignment with Employer's Requirements. Method: ER compliance checklist; TBD until ER volumes are available.

**Format and Standards Verification:**

- **V6:** Verify drawings conform to project CAD standard for layers, symbols, line types, and file naming conventions (R7). Method: CAD file audit; TBD pending CAD standard availability.
- **V7:** Verify all drawing sheets include complete title block information with proper document control fields (R8). Method: title block completeness checklist.
- **V8:** Verify coordinate system, datum, and scales are consistent and appropriate (R9, R10). Method: drawing review for consistency.

**Cross-Document Verification:**

- **V9:** Verify drawings reference DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification where materials, methods, and quality requirements are specified (R13). Method: cross-reference check between drawing notes and specification.
- **V10:** Verify safety-critical items noted on drawings are consistent with safety requirements in DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures (R14). Method: cross-deliverable consistency check; TBD pending DEL-01.03 completion.
