# Specification: DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set

## Scope

This deliverable defines the design arrangement and details for demolition in PKG-01 Demolition & Removals, including removal and disposal of existing infrastructure such as Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, and the salt tent, and associated decommissioning activities. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope and DEL-01.01 entry (location TBD).

Exclusions: Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Requirements

- R1: The drawing set shall define the design arrangement and details for demolition in accordance with Employer's Requirements (ER). Source: decomposition DEL-01.01 description; ER volumes not available here (location TBD).
- R2: The drawing set shall include demolition plans. Source: _CONTEXT.md.
- R3: The drawing set shall include removal sequence drawings. Source: _CONTEXT.md.
- R4: The drawing set shall include disposal location plans. Source: _CONTEXT.md.
- R5: The drawing set shall cover demolition of Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, and salt tent dismantling within PKG-01 scope. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).
- R6: Document control fields (title, revision, dates, approvals) shall be included. ASSUMPTION: standard D&B drawing control; details TBD.

## Standards

- Applicable demolition, civil drawing, and regulatory standards: TBD pending reference documents.
- ASSUMPTION: Project CAD standard applies; specific standard not provided.

## Verification

- V1: Verify inclusion of required drawing types (demolition plans, sequence drawings, disposal location plans). ASSUMPTION: document review against R2-R4.
- V2: Verify coverage of PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). ASSUMPTION: scope compliance check against R5.
- V3: Verify alignment with ER requirements. TBD until ER volumes are available.

## Documentation
