# Procedure: DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Produce the DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set, defining the design arrangement, phasing, and disposal planning for demolition operations in PKG-01 (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent) in accordance with Employer's Requirements and project document control standards.

This procedure describes both:
1. **Production process:** How to produce the demolition design drawing set deliverable.
2. **Usage guidance:** How the completed drawing set is used by other project parties during demolition execution.

Source: _CONTEXT.md, decomposition DEL-01.01 entry, and ASSUMPTION: dual-use procedure scope per 4_DOCUMENTS protocol.

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:**

- Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md for tracking mode). ASSUMPTION: DEL-01.01 drawings likely precede DEL-01.02 (specification), DEL-01.03 (procedures), and DEL-01.04 (records) in typical document workflow, but sequencing is human-managed.

**Required Reference Materials:**

The following inputs are required to produce the drawing set but are not currently available in _REFERENCES.md (TBD):

- **Employer's Requirements (ER) volumes:** Demolition scope definition, technical requirements, acceptance criteria, CAD standards. Source: decomposition references ER Volume 2 Parts 1-3; location TBD.
- **Existing condition documentation:** As-built drawings of Track 6 (rail), Dolphin 2 (marine structure), fencing layout, salt tent; structural condition assessments; utility locate surveys.
- **Site surveys:** Topographic survey, control point network, coordinate system and datum definition.
- **Environmental and hazardous materials reports:** Hazardous materials survey (asbestos, lead, contaminated soils); environmental constraints and permit requirements.
- **Operational constraints:** Terminal operations schedule, access restrictions, marine traffic coordination requirements, rail operations coordination.

**Required Project Standards:**

- **Project CAD standard:** Layer naming, symbol library, line types, text styles, file naming conventions, sheet layout templates. TBD: CAD standard reference.
- **Project document control procedures:** Drawing numbering system, revision tracking, title block format, approval workflow. TBD: document control standard.
- **Interface coordination process:** Process for identifying and documenting interfaces to Employer-responsible items and adjacent work packages. TBD: interface management procedure.

**Scope Definition:**

- **Package scope:** Demolition and disposal of Track 6 (rail infrastructure), Dolphin 2 (marine structure), perimeter fencing, salt tent dismantling, and associated decommissioning. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope.
- **Interface boundaries:** Exclude Employer-responsible items (permits, nitrogen skid) except interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus.

## Steps

**Phase 1: Information Gathering and Scope Definition**

**Step 1.1: Compile Reference Materials**
- Obtain Employer's Requirements (ER) volumes and extract demolition-specific requirements. TBD: ER availability.
- Obtain existing condition documentation (as-builts, surveys, structural assessments) for all items to be demolished: Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent.
- Obtain site surveys (topographic, utility locates) and project control point data.
- Obtain environmental reports (hazardous materials survey, disposal requirements).
- Review project CAD standard and document control procedures. TBD: standards availability.
- **Verification:** Confirm all prerequisite materials are available and current revisions; document any missing information as TBD in drawing notes.

**Step 1.2: Define Demolition Scope and Limits**
- Extract PKG-01 scope definition from decomposition and ER requirements: Track 6 rail infrastructure extent, Dolphin 2 structure limits, fencing alignment, salt tent footprint, associated decommissioning items.
- Identify interface boundaries: coordination points with Employer-responsible items, tie-in points to retained infrastructure, limits between PKG-01 and adjacent packages (e.g., PKG-02 Earthworks).
- Document scope exclusions per decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (Employer-responsible items except interfaces).
- **Verification:** Cross-check scope definition against decomposition and ER; resolve any ambiguities via RFI or coordination process.

**Step 1.3: Assess Site Constraints and Coordination Requirements**
- Identify terminal operational constraints: active rail operations, marine traffic patterns, access restrictions, work windows.
- Identify safety constraints: proximity to energized systems, fall hazards, marine work requirements, hazardous materials handling.
- Identify environmental constraints: dust control zones, erosion control requirements, noise restrictions, disposal restrictions.
- Coordinate with adjacent work packages to define interface requirements.
- **Verification:** Document all constraints as drawing notes or coordination requirements; confirm constraints with project management and terminal operations.
