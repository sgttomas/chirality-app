# Procedure: DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Produce the demolition design drawing set required for PKG-01 demolition and removals. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.01 entry (location TBD).

## Prerequisites

- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements volumes and existing site condition information are required but not provided in _REFERENCES.md (TBD).
- **Inputs:** Package scope for demolition and removals (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).

## Steps

ASSUMPTION: Steps below reflect a typical document-production workflow; adjust to project procedures when available.

1. Compile available inputs (ER volumes, existing drawings, surveys, permits). TBD until references are provided.
2. Define demolition limits, interfaces, and constraints consistent with PKG-01 scope and Scope Focus. Source: decomposition (location TBD).
3. Draft demolition plans showing limits and removal extents. Source: anticipated artifacts in _CONTEXT.md.
4. Draft removal sequence drawings and disposal location plans. Source: anticipated artifacts in _CONTEXT.md.
5. Perform internal checks for completeness and alignment with ER requirements. TBD until ER volumes are available.
6. Issue controlled drawing set per document control requirements. ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control workflow.

## Verification

- Check that required drawing types are present (demolition plans, sequence drawings, disposal location plans). ASSUMPTION based on anticipated artifacts.
- Check coverage of PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). ASSUMPTION based on PKG-01 scope.
- ER compliance check: TBD pending ER volumes.

## Records

- Issued demolition design drawing set (controlled revisions).
- Review comments and response log. ASSUMPTION: standard document control practice.
