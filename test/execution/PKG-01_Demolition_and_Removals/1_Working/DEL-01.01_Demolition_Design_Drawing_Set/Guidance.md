# Guidance: DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Provide clear, comprehensive demolition design drawings that:

1. Define the spatial extent and arrangement of demolition operations for PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent).
2. Communicate the phased sequence of demolition operations to support safe and efficient execution.
3. Document disposal planning including haul routes, staging areas, and material management approach.
4. Establish interface coordination requirements with Employer-responsible items and adjacent work packages.
5. Serve as the primary reference for demolition execution covered in DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures and quality verification covered in DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation & Test Records.

## Principles

**Safety and Clarity:**

- **Unambiguous communication:** Demolition drawings must clearly distinguish items to be demolished from items to remain, with no room for misinterpretation during execution. ASSUMPTION: fundamental to safe demolition practice and aligned with project safety objectives.
- **Hazard visibility:** Safety-critical demolition operations, temporary conditions, and protection requirements must be prominently noted on drawings. ASSUMPTION: supports safe execution and coordination.

**Scope and Interface Management:**

- **Scope boundaries:** Clearly delineate Contractor demolition scope (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent) and exclude Employer-responsible items except for interface connections. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope and Section 1.2 Scope Focus.
- **Interface coordination:** Identify and document all interface connections to Employer-responsible items and adjacent work packages to prevent gaps or overlaps. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (interface coordination required).

**Constructability and Sequencing:**

- **Logical sequencing:** Removal sequence must respect structural dependencies, site access constraints, and terminal operational continuity requirements. ASSUMPTION: critical for demolition in active terminal environment.
- **Practical execution:** Drawing details should support field execution, not just design intent—include dimensions, reference points, and coordination notes usable by demolition crews. ASSUMPTION: standard constructability principle.

**Integration with Project Documentation:**

- **Cross-deliverable consistency:** Demolition drawings form the spatial reference for DEL-01.02 (Technical Specification—what/how to demolish), DEL-01.03 (Procedures—execution methods), and DEL-01.04 (Records—verification). Changes to drawings must be reflected in related deliverables. ASSUMPTION: multi-deliverable package coherence requirement.

## Considerations

**Information Requirements:**

- **Existing conditions:** Accurate as-built drawings, structural assessments, and surveys of items to be demolished (Track 6 rail, Dolphin 2 structure, fencing alignment, salt tent) are essential to define demolition limits and avoid conflicts. TBD: availability and accuracy of existing condition documentation.
- **Subsurface and hidden conditions:** Utility locations, foundation depths, and buried infrastructure must be investigated to plan safe demolition and avoid utility strikes. TBD: utility locate reports and geotechnical information for existing structures.
- **Hazardous materials:** Presence of asbestos, lead paint, contaminated soils, or other hazardous materials in existing structures must be assessed prior to finalizing demolition methods shown on drawings. TBD: hazardous materials survey results.

**Operational and Site Constraints:**

- **Terminal continuity:** Fraser Surrey Terminal operations must continue during demolition; drawings must show phasing that minimizes operational disruption, maintains safe access routes, and coordinates with terminal scheduling. Source: decomposition Section 1.1 (project context) and ASSUMPTION: operational continuity objective applies.
- **Marine and rail interfaces:** Demolition of Dolphin 2 (marine structure) and Track 6 (rail infrastructure) must coordinate with marine traffic and rail operations; access, equipment positioning, and work windows must be considered. ASSUMPTION: coordination required given infrastructure type.
- **Site access and logistics:** Demolition equipment access, haul routes for removed materials, and staging areas must be planned within site constraints of an active terminal. TBD: site access plan and logistics coordination.

**Regulatory and Environmental:**

- **Disposal requirements:** Different material types (concrete, steel, contaminated materials) have different disposal/recycling requirements; drawings should facilitate material segregation. TBD: waste management plan and disposal site requirements.
- **Environmental protection:** Dust control, erosion and sediment control, spill prevention, and noise mitigation measures may need to be shown on drawings or referenced. TBD: environmental permits and protection requirements.
- **Permits and approvals:** Drawings may require review and approval by regulatory agencies (Port Authority, environmental agencies, WorkSafeBC). TBD: permitting requirements and approval process.

**Coordination with Other Packages:**

- **Earthworks coordination (PKG-02):** Demolition limits and final grades must coordinate with subsequent earthworks; interface elevations and tie-in points should be defined. ASSUMPTION: PKG-01 typically precedes PKG-02 in execution sequence.
- **New construction interfaces:** Demolition must clear areas for new construction packages without over-removal; coordinate limits of demolition with limits of new work. TBD: interface coordination with downstream packages.

## Trade-offs

**Drawing Detail vs. Production Efficiency:**

- **More detail:** Highly detailed drawings with extensive dimensions, notes, and callouts reduce field interpretation and improve quality control, but increase drawing production time, file size, and potential for drawing revisions as conditions change.
- **Less detail:** Simplified drawings with key information only expedite drawing production and allow more field flexibility, but may result in RFIs, field coordination issues, or inconsistent execution.
- **Consideration:** Balance depends on complexity of demolition (simple fence removal vs. complex structural demolition), site constraints, and quality control requirements. ASSUMPTION: appropriate detail level TBD based on ER requirements and project risk tolerance.

**Sequencing Prescription vs. Execution Flexibility:**

- **Prescribed sequencing:** Detailed removal sequence drawings with specific phase boundaries and timing constraints provide clear direction and support coordination, but may reduce contractor flexibility to adapt to field conditions, weather, or equipment availability.
- **Flexible sequencing:** General sequence guidance with fewer constraints allows contractor to optimize execution based on real-time conditions, but may create coordination gaps or conflicts with adjacent operations.
- **Consideration:** Critical path items (e.g., Dolphin 2 removal coordinating with marine access, Track 6 removal coordinating with rail operations) likely require prescribed sequencing; less-critical items (fencing removal) may allow more flexibility. TBD: sequence constraints from site operations and coordination requirements.

**Phasing Complexity vs. Operational Continuity:**

- **More phases:** Multiple small demolition phases minimize disruption to terminal operations and allow work in small increments, but increase mobilization/demobilization costs, extend overall schedule, and complicate coordination.
- **Fewer phases:** Fewer, larger demolition phases simplify execution and reduce overall duration, but may require larger operational disruptions or area closures.
- **Consideration:** Depends on terminal operational constraints, acceptable disruption windows, and cost/schedule priorities. TBD: terminal operational requirements and project priorities.

**Disposal Detail vs. Contractor Flexibility:**

- **Detailed disposal planning:** Drawings specifying exact haul routes, staging areas, and disposal methods provide clear guidance and support environmental compliance, but may constrain contractor's waste management approach and material recycling opportunities.
- **Performance-based disposal requirements:** Allowing contractor flexibility to propose disposal approach (shown on drawings for approval) may enable cost savings and better recycling rates, but requires clear performance criteria and approval process.
- **Consideration:** ER requirements and environmental regulations may mandate certain disposal approaches; contractor expertise in waste management may justify performance-based approach where allowed. TBD: ER disposal requirements and project procurement approach.
