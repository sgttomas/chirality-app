# Guidance: DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Provide clear demolition design drawings that define arrangement, sequencing, and disposal planning for PKG-01 demolition works. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.01 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

- Clarity and completeness of demolition scope communication to support safe execution. ASSUMPTION: aligned with project safety objectives; objective mapping does not list PKG-01.
- Respect contractor scope boundaries and interface-only connections to Employer-responsible items. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Capture demolition of existing infrastructure identified in PKG-01 scope (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).

## Considerations

- Existing condition information (surveys, as-builts) needed to define limits and interfaces. TBD (references not provided).
- Environmental and regulatory constraints on demolition and disposal. TBD pending ER volumes and permits.
- Terminal continuity and operational impacts during demolition. ASSUMPTION: relevant to project objectives; mapping to PKG-01 not specified.

## Trade-offs

- Level of drawing detail vs. schedule and revision effort. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.
- Sequencing clarity vs. flexibility for field execution. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.

## Examples

- TBD (no example drawings available in references).

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

- None identified from available sources.
