## Conditions

**Site / operational context:**

- **Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1.1 Project Context.
- **Demolition scope:** Removal and disposal of existing infrastructure including Track 6 (rail infrastructure), Dolphin 2 (marine structure), perimeter fencing, salt tent dismantling, and associated decommissioning activities. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope.
- **Interface boundaries:** Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus.
- **Terminal operations:** Works must consider continuity of existing terminal operations during demolition phase. ASSUMPTION: applicable to project operational continuity objectives.

**Design / environmental conditions:**

- **Existing condition documentation:** TBD (as-built drawings, surveys, structural assessments required for demolition design).
- **Environmental constraints:** TBD (disposal requirements, contaminated materials handling, environmental permits).
- **Hazardous materials:** TBD (presence and extent of hazardous materials in existing structures to be demolished).
- **Access and staging:** TBD (site access routes, laydown areas, equipment constraints within active terminal).
- **Weather and seasonal constraints:** TBD (work windows, environmental protection measures).
- **Design life:** Not applicable (demolition drawings document removal, not permanent construction).

## Construction

**Drawing content (per anticipated artifacts):**

- **Demolition plans:** Plan view drawings showing extent of demolition, items to be removed, and items to remain. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.
- **Removal sequence drawings:** Phased demolition sequence showing order of operations, temporary conditions, and critical path dependencies. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.
- **Disposal location plans:** Drawings showing haul routes, staging areas for removed materials, and designated disposal/recycling locations. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.

**Configuration details (to be shown on drawings):**

- **Demolition limits and interfaces:** Extent of each demolition item (Track 6 rail, Dolphin 2 structure, fencing alignment, salt tent footprint), tie-in points to retained infrastructure, interface coordination with Employer-responsible items. TBD pending existing condition surveys and interface coordination.
- **Temporary works or protection measures:** Temporary shoring, dust control barriers, traffic control, utility protection, environmental protection measures. TBD pending site-specific requirements.
- **Notes and specifications:** General notes, reference to DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification, safety requirements, regulatory references. ASSUMPTION: standard demolition drawing practice; details TBD.
- **Symbols and legends:** Standard demolition symbols (item to be demolished, item to remain, limit of work). ASSUMPTION: CAD standard defines symbols; specific standard TBD.
