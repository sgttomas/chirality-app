# Guidance: DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures

## Purpose

Provide executable demolition procedures that enable safe, quality, and operationally coordinated execution of PKG-01 demolition works through clear step-by-step work instructions, hazard controls, and quality verification methods.

Source: _CONTEXT.md description and ASSUMPTION: procedure purpose derived from deliverable type.

## Principles

**Safety First:**
- Procedures must prioritize worker safety and public safety above schedule and cost considerations. All identified hazards must have specific controls.
- Procedures must be hazard-specific, not generic. Controls for Track 6 (rail operations, track stability) differ from Dolphin 2 (marine safety, weather) and salt tent (building collapse, hazardous materials).

**Clarity and Usability:**
- Procedures must be written for the intended users (demolition crews, supervisors, inspectors) with appropriate technical level and detail.
- Steps must be sequential, actionable, and verifiable. Avoid ambiguous instructions.

**Integration with Package Documentation:**
- Procedures implement DEL-01.02 specification requirements ("how to" achieve "what" is specified).
- Procedures reference DEL-01.01 drawings for spatial coordination.
- Procedures support DEL-01.04 inspection and verification.

## Considerations

- Structure-specific hazards and methods (rail vs. marine vs. building demolition require different procedures).
- Terminal operational coordination (work windows, access, notifications).
- Weather and seasonal constraints affecting methods and safety.
- Hazardous materials handling if present (asbestos, lead, contaminated ballast).
- Emergency response and contingency planning.
- Personnel qualifications and training requirements.

## Trade-offs

**Detail Level:** High detail provides clarity but increases documentation burden and may reduce flexibility. Balance depends on work complexity and personnel experience.

**Prescriptive vs. Performance-Based:** Prescriptive procedures (specific equipment, specific steps) provide clear direction but limit adaptation. Performance-based procedures (outcome-focused) allow flexibility but require experienced personnel.

## Examples

TBD: Procedure examples when ER and project HSE templates are provided.
