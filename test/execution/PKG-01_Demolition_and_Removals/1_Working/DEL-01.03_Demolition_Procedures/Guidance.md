# Guidance: DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures

## Purpose

Provide documented demolition execution methods and controls for PKG-01 works, including method statements and specific removal procedures. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.03 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

- Procedures should prioritize safety and control of demolition activities. Source: _CONTEXT.md (safety, quality, operational requirements).
- Procedures should clearly address PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).
- Maintain contractor scope boundaries and interface-only connections to Employer-responsible items. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Considerations

- HSE requirements and permits are not provided; integrate when ER volumes are available. TBD.
- Environmental controls (dust, noise, waste handling) are unknown until references are provided. TBD.
- Objective mapping does not list PKG-01; alignment to project objectives is TBD pending human confirmation.

## Trade-offs

- Prescriptive procedures vs. field flexibility. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.
- Sequence rigidity vs. adaptability to existing conditions. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.

## Examples

- TBD (no example procedures available in references).

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

- None identified from available sources.
