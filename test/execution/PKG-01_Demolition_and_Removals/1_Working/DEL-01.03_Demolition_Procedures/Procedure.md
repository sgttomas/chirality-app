# Procedure: DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures

## Purpose

Produce the demolition procedures deliverable (method statements and specific removal procedures) for PKG-01. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.03 entry (location TBD).

## Prerequisites

- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements volumes, HSE requirements, and permit conditions (not provided in _REFERENCES.md). TBD.
- **Inputs:** PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent). Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).

## Steps

ASSUMPTION: Steps below reflect a typical procedure document-development workflow; execution-level demolition steps are TBD pending references.

1. Gather reference inputs (ER volumes, HSE requirements, permit constraints, existing condition information). TBD until references are provided.
2. Define procedure structure and required sections (method statements, Track 6 removal, Dolphin 2 removal). Source: _CONTEXT.md.
3. Draft demolition method statements and specific removal procedures. Source: _CONTEXT.md; details TBD.
4. Review procedures for coverage of safety, quality, and operational controls. Source: _CONTEXT.md; details TBD.
5. Perform internal QC and issue controlled procedures. ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control workflow.

## Verification

- Check that required procedure components are present (method statements, Track 6 removal, Dolphin 2 removal). ASSUMPTION.
- Verify ER and HSE alignment once references are available. TBD.

## Records

- Issued demolition procedures (controlled revisions).
- Review and approval records. ASSUMPTION: standard document control practice.
