# Procedure: DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures

## Purpose

Produce the DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures deliverable, defining execution methods and controls for PKG-01 demolition operations per Employer's Requirements and project HSE system.

This procedure describes both production process and usage guidance for demolition procedures.

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** Coordinated externally (see _DEPENDENCIES.md). ASSUMPTION: Procedures developed after or concurrently with DEL-01.01 (spatial reference) and DEL-01.02 (requirements to implement).

**Required Inputs:**
- ER volumes for demolition method requirements. TBD.
- DEL-01.01 drawings for spatial limits and phasing coordination.
- DEL-01.02 specification for performance requirements to implement.
- Hazard assessments, risk assessments, and site-specific safety/operational requirements. TBD.
- Project HSE procedure template. TBD.

## Steps

**Phase 1: Requirements and Hazard Analysis**
- Extract demolition method and safety requirements from ER and DEL-01.02 specification.
- Conduct hazard assessment for each PKG-01 structure (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent).
- Identify structure-specific safety controls, quality controls, and operational coordination requirements.
- Document hazards and required controls.

**Phase 2: Procedure Development**
- Draft general demolition method statements covering common approach and HSE integration.
- Draft structure-specific procedures (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent) with:
  - Purpose, scope, responsibilities
  - Prerequisites (permits, approvals, equipment, conditions)
  - Detailed method steps referencing DEL-01.01 for spatial coordination
  - Safety controls addressing identified hazards
  - Quality controls with inspection hold points supporting DEL-01.04
  - Records and documentation requirements
  - Cross-references to DEL-01.01, DEL-01.02, applicable standards

**Phase 3: Review and Approval**
- Technical review for constructability and clarity.
- HSE review for hazard control adequacy and regulatory compliance.
- Site management review for operational coordination.
- Resolve comments and obtain required approvals (HSE manager, site manager, discipline lead).

**Phase 4: Distribution and Training**
- Issue controlled procedures with document control tracking.
- Conduct procedure training for demolition personnel.
- Document training completion.

## Verification

- **V1-V5:** Content verification per Specification (method statements and structure procedures included; safety, quality, operational requirements addressed; ER compliance).
- **V6-V8:** Technical verification (steps are executable; safety controls are effective; quality controls support DEL-01.04).
- **V9-V11:** Cross-document verification (implements DEL-01.02; references DEL-01.01; supports DEL-01.04).
- **V12-V14:** Approval and format verification (template compliance; approvals obtained; document control).

## Records

- **Issued procedures** (controlled revisions).
- **Hazard and risk assessments** supporting safety controls.
- **Review and approval records** (HSE, technical, management sign-offs).
- **Training records** documenting personnel training on procedures.
- **Requirements traceability matrix** linking DEL-01.02 requirements to procedure steps.

**Usage:** Procedures are used during demolition execution to guide work activities, safety controls, and quality verification. Procedure compliance is verified through DEL-01.04 inspection records.
