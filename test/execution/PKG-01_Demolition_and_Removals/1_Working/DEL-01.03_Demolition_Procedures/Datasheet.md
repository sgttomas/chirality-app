## Conditions

**Project Context:**

- **Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1.1 Project Context.
- **Demolition scope:** Track 6 (rail infrastructure), Dolphin 2 (marine structure), perimeter fencing, salt tent dismantling, and associated decommissioning. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope.
- **Purpose:** Procedures define execution methods and controls for demolition to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md description.
- **Interface boundaries:** Employer-responsible items (permits, nitrogen skid) excluded except interface coordination. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus.
- **Terminal operations:** Procedures must address continuity of terminal operations during demolition. ASSUMPTION: operational continuity objective applies.

**Operational Conditions:**

- **Safety requirements:** Procedures must address all identified hazards including structural stability during demolition, fall protection, marine safety (Dolphin 2), utility strikes, dust/noise exposure, hazardous materials (if present). WorkSafeBC compliance mandatory. ASSUMPTION: WorkSafeBC applies to BC project; specific hazards TBD from hazard assessments.
- **Environmental requirements:** Procedures must address environmental controls including dust/noise control, erosion and sediment control, spill prevention, waste segregation and disposal per environmental permits. ASSUMPTION: BC environmental regulations apply; specific requirements TBD from permits.
- **Terminal coordination:** Procedures must address coordination with terminal operations including work permits, access control, marine traffic coordination (Dolphin 2), rail operations coordination (Track 6), and notification protocols. TBD: terminal coordination requirements from terminal management.
- **Weather and seasonal:** Procedures must address weather constraints including wet weather work protocols (Pacific Northwest climate), wind limits for marine work, and seasonal work windows. ASSUMPTION: weather affects demolition methods and safety; specific constraints TBD.

## Construction

**Procedure Content (per anticipated artifacts):**

- **Demolition Method Statements (General):** High-level procedures describing overall demolition approach, HSE management system integration, quality control approach, and common demolition methods applicable to multiple structures. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.

- **Track 6 Removal Procedure:** Detailed step-by-step procedure for Track 6 (rail infrastructure) demolition including:
  - Pre-work activities (rail operations coordination, utility locates, access setup)
  - Track removal sequence and methods
  - Ballast and tie handling/disposal
  - Contaminated materials handling (if ballast contamination present)
  - Safety controls specific to rail work (rail operations coordination, track stability, equipment positioning)
  - Quality inspection and completion criteria
  - Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.

- **Dolphin 2 Removal Procedure:** Detailed step-by-step procedure for Dolphin 2 (marine structure) demolition including:
  - Pre-work activities (marine traffic coordination, tide/weather assessment, marine safety zone establishment)
  - Marine equipment mobilization (barge, crane)
  - Dolphin removal sequence and methods
  - Marine debris control
  - Safety controls specific to marine work (marine safety regulations, weather limits, fall protection over water)
  - Environmental controls (marine environmental protection)
  - Quality inspection and completion criteria
  - Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.

- **Additional Procedures:** Fencing removal procedure and salt tent demolition procedure (not explicitly listed in _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts but required to cover full PKG-01 scope). ASSUMPTION: all PKG-01 scope items require procedures; specific procedures TBD.

**Procedure Structure (typical sections):**

TBD: Specific format per project HSE procedure template; typical structure:
1. **Purpose:** What this procedure accomplishes
2. **Scope:** What work is covered / excluded
3. **Responsibilities:** Roles and responsibilities for procedure execution and verification
4. **Prerequisites:** Required permits, approvals, equipment, conditions before starting work
5. **Method/Steps:** Detailed step-by-step work instructions
6. **Safety Requirements:** Specific safety controls, PPE, hazard mitigations, emergency response
7. **Environmental Controls:** Dust control, erosion control, spill prevention, waste handling specific to this procedure
8. **Quality Controls:** Inspection hold points, acceptance criteria, verification methods
9. **Records:** Documentation requirements and record retention
10. **References:** Related drawings (DEL-01.01), specifications (DEL-01.02), standards, permits

**Cross-References:**

- References DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set for spatial limits, phasing, and interface locations. ASSUMPTION: drawings provide "where," procedures provide "how."
- Implements requirements from DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification. Specification sets requirements ("what" and "how well"), procedures define implementation methods ("how to"). Cross-reference: Specification R23, V14.
- Procedures inform inspection activities documented in DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation & Test Records. Procedures define method steps and safety/quality controls; records verify execution and compliance.
