# Guidance: DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Provide objective evidence of demolition completion, inspection, testing, and regulatory compliance for PKG-01, supporting project acceptance and closeout.

Source: _CONTEXT.md and ASSUMPTION: record purpose derived from deliverable type.

## Principles

**Objective Evidence:**
- Records must provide objective, verifiable evidence of completion and compliance (inspection checklists, photos, test reports, manifests, certificates).
- Subjective statements without supporting evidence are insufficient for acceptance.

**Traceability:**
- Records must be traceable to DEL-01.02 requirements, DEL-01.03 procedures, and DEL-01.01 spatial limits.
- Each record should reference the requirement or procedure it verifies.

**Completeness:**
- Records must cover all PKG-01 scope items (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent) and all inspection/test hold points defined in DEL-01.02.
- Missing records create gaps in compliance demonstration.

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- Records must satisfy regulatory record-keeping requirements (WorkSafeBC, environmental agencies, disposal regulations).

## Considerations

- Record types and formats per project QA/QC plan and ER requirements (TBD).
- Inspection hold points and acceptance criteria from DEL-01.02 specification.
- Disposal documentation requirements from waste regulations and environmental permits (TBD).
- Record retention requirements (regulatory and contractual). TBD: retention period.
- Digital vs. hard copy record requirements. TBD: project record management system.

## Trade-offs

**Detail Level:** Detailed records provide strong evidence but increase administrative burden. Balance depends on risk level and regulatory requirements.

**Real-Time vs. Retrospective:** Real-time record generation during work is more accurate but requires field documentation discipline. Retrospective compilation is easier but may be less accurate or complete.

## Examples

TBD: Record examples when project QA/QC templates and ER requirements are provided.
