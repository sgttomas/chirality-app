# Guidance: DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation and Test Records

## Purpose

Provide evidence that demolition works were completed, inspected, and tested as required for PKG-01. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-01.04 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

- Records should be complete, traceable, and aligned with required demolition scope. Source: _CONTEXT.md and decomposition PKG-01 scope (location TBD).
- Maintain contractor scope boundaries and interface-only connections to Employer-responsible items. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Considerations

- Regulatory and permit-driven record requirements are not provided; integrate when ER volumes are available. TBD.
- Evidence types beyond disposal manifests and completion certificates are unknown until references are provided. TBD.
- Objective mapping does not list PKG-01; alignment to project objectives is TBD pending human confirmation.

## Trade-offs

- Level of record detail vs. administrative burden. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.
- Field flexibility vs. documentation completeness. ASSUMPTION; details TBD.

## Examples

- TBD (no example record packages available in references).

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

- None identified from available sources.

## References

- _CONTEXT.md (DEL-01.04).
- Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-01 scope, DEL-01.04 entry, Scope Focus; location TBD).
