# Procedure: DEL-01.04 Demolition Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Produce the DEL-01.04 record package providing evidence of demolition completion, inspection, testing, and regulatory compliance for PKG-01.

This procedure describes record production workflow and usage guidance.

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** Coordinated externally (see _DEPENDENCIES.md). ASSUMPTION: Records compiled during and after demolition execution per DEL-01.03 procedures.

**Required Inputs:**
- Completed demolition works per DEL-01.01, DEL-01.02, DEL-01.03.
- Field inspection checklists and reports generated during work.
- Disposal manifests and receipts from waste disposal/recycling.
- Test reports (if testing required per DEL-01.02).
- Project QA/QC plan and record templates. TBD.
- ER record requirements. TBD.

## Steps

**Phase 1: Record Generation (during execution)**
- Conduct inspections per DEL-01.02 hold points (pre-demo, phase completion, final completion).
- Complete inspection checklists and document findings with photos.
- Obtain disposal manifests and receipts for all waste disposed/recycled.
- Conduct testing (if required) and obtain test reports.
- Document non-conformances (if any) and corrective actions.

**Phase 2: Record Compilation (post-execution)**
- Collect all field records (inspection checklists, test reports, manifests, photos).
- Organize records by structure/phase per DEL-01.01 phasing or by record type.
- Verify record completeness against DEL-01.02 requirements and DEL-01.03 procedures.
- Prepare master record index listing all records, dates, and approval status.
- Compile completion certificates (contractor, QA/QC, Engineer/Owner).

**Phase 3: Review and Approval**
- QA/QC manager reviews records for completeness and compliance.
- Resolve any record gaps or deficiencies.
- Obtain QA/QC manager approval.
- Submit record package to Engineer/Owner for acceptance.
- Address any review comments and obtain final acceptance.

**Phase 4: Issuance and Retention**
- Issue final record package with controlled distribution.
- File records in project document management system.
- Ensure records are retained per retention schedule. TBD: retention period.

## Verification

- **V1-V3:** Verify record completeness (disposal manifests, completion certificates, inspection evidence, ER alignment per Specification requirements).
- **V4-V5:** Verify records demonstrate compliance with DEL-01.02 requirements and execution of DEL-01.03 procedures.
- **V6:** Verify approvals and acceptance obtained.

## Records

- **Issued record package** (inspection records, disposal manifests, completion certificates, test reports if applicable).
- **Master record index** and approval tracking.
- **Retention:** Records retained per retention schedule.TBD: specific period.

**Usage:** Records provide evidence for project acceptance, contract closeout, regulatory compliance demonstration, and future reference (liability protection, lessons learned).
