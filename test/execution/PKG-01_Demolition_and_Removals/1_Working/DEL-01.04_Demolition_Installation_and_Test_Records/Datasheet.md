## Conditions

**Project Context:**

- **Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1.1 Project Context.
- **Demolition scope:** Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent. Source: decomposition PKG-01 scope.
- **Purpose:** Records provide objective evidence of completion, inspection, testing, and regulatory compliance for demolition works. Source: _CONTEXT.md description.

**Record Requirements:**

- **Inspection evidence:** Records must document that demolition work was inspected per DEL-01.02 specification inspection requirements and DEL-01.03 procedure quality controls. ASSUMPTION: inspection records required for quality assurance; specific requirements TBD from project QA/QC plan.
- **Completion evidence:** Records must demonstrate that demolition is complete per DEL-01.02 completion criteria and demolition limits shown on DEL-01.01 drawings. ASSUMPTION: completion verification required; criteria TBD.
- **Disposal evidence:** Disposal manifests and receipts required for all demolition waste per DEL-01.02 disposal requirements and regulatory compliance. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts (disposal manifests).
- **Test evidence (if applicable):** Test records required if DEL-01.02 specification includes testing requirements (e.g., compaction testing if demolition includes backfill). TBD: test requirements from DEL-01.02.
- **Regulatory compliance:** Records must satisfy WorkSafeBC, environmental agency, and other regulatory record-keeping requirements. ASSUMPTION: regulatory records required; specific requirements TBD from permits and regulations.

## Construction

**Record Content (per anticipated artifacts and project QA/QC requirements):**

- **Inspection Records:**
  - Pre-demolition inspection reports (existing conditions, utilities, hazards, interfaces)
  - Phase completion inspection checklists (per DEL-01.01 phasing and DEL-01.03 procedures)
  - Final completion inspection reports (demolition complete per DEL-01.02 completion criteria)
  - Special inspection records for high-risk operations (marine work, rail coordination, hazardous materials)
  - Non-conformance reports (NCRs) and corrective action records (if non-conformances occur)
  - Photo logs documenting pre-demolition conditions, work in progress, and final conditions
  - ASSUMPTION: typical inspection record types for demolition work; specific requirements TBD from project QA/QC plan.

- **Test Records (if applicable):**
  - Material testing records (if demolition includes testing—e.g., contaminated soil testing, asbestos air monitoring)
  - Backfill compaction testing (if demolition areas are backfilled)
  - TBD: test requirements from DEL-01.02 specification; test records required only if testing is specified.

- **Disposal Manifests and Receipts:**
  - Waste manifests documenting waste type, quantity, origin, and destination for all demolition waste. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.
  - Disposal receipts from licensed disposal facilities confirming waste acceptance and final disposition.
  - Recycling certificates documenting recycled materials and recycling rates (if recycling requirements in DEL-01.02).
  - Hazardous waste manifests and disposal certificates (if hazardous materials present). TBD: hazardous materials presence from survey.
  - ASSUMPTION: manifests required for regulatory compliance and contract documentation; specific requirements TBD from waste regulations.

- **Completion Certificates:**
  - Contractor completion certificate stating that demolition is complete per contract requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts.
  - QA/QC manager sign-off certifying that work meets quality requirements.
  - Engineer/Owner acceptance certificate acknowledging completion and acceptance of demolition work.
  - Demolition contractor certifications (contractor qualifications, insurance, licensing).
  - ASSUMPTION: typical completion certification process; specific certificates TBD from contract and project QA/QC procedures.

**Record Organization and Format:**

TBD: Specific organization per project QA/QC system; typical structure:
- Records organized by deliverable (DEL-01.04) and by structure/phase (Track 6, Dolphin 2, fencing, salt tent; or by demolition phase per DEL-01.01).
- Master record index listing all records, dates, and approval status.
- Electronic records repository with controlled access and backup.
- Hard copy records binder(s) if required by contract.

**Cross-References:**

- Records verify compliance with DEL-01.02 Demolition Technical Specification requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Records document execution of DEL-01.03 Demolition Procedures and verification of procedure compliance.
- Records reference DEL-01.01 Demolition Design Drawing Set for spatial verification (limits, phases).
