**Phase 2 Expansion Context:**

- **OBJ-8: Future Expandability** — "The design facilitates Phase 2 expansion with minimal disruption" (Decomposition Section 2)
- **Phase 2 scope:** **TBD** — Specific Phase 2 capacity, facilities, timing from Employer's long-term planning
- **Typical Phase 2 expansions for transload facilities:**
  - Additional storage tank(s)
  - Additional railcar unloading capacity (additional tracks/stations)
  - Additional marine loading capacity (additional berth, loading arms)
  - Increased throughput (2x-3x Phase 1 capacity typical)
  - Product diversification (additional grades or products)
- **Phase 1-Phase 2 relationship:** Phase 1 design must not preclude Phase 2; Phase 1 provides interface provisions; Phase 2 construction minimizes disruption to Phase 1 operations

**Source:** Decomposition Sections 1.1, 2 (OBJ-8); **ASSUMPTION**: Typical transload facility expansion patterns; **TBD** — Employer-specific Phase 2 requirements

**Site and Layout Considerations:**

- Fraser Surrey Terminal site constraints: **TBD** — Available land for Phase 2 expansion, existing facilities, property boundaries
- Rail infrastructure: CN rail access; potential for additional rail tracks or extended sidings for Phase 2
- Marine berth capacity: Existing or future berth capacity for Phase 2 marine loading
- Utility corridors: Space for expanded utilities (power, water, fire water, instrument air, etc.)
- Laydown and construction access: Phase 2 construction logistics while Phase 1 operates

**Source:** Decomposition Section 1.1; **ASSUMPTION**: Site constraints typical for existing marine terminal expansion; **TBD** — Site-specific constraints from site investigation and terminal operations

## Construction

**Anticipated Artifacts:**

Per _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-27.03 entry:
1. **Phase 2 General Arrangement Drawing** — Site layout showing Phase 1 facilities and conceptual Phase 2 expansion facilities
