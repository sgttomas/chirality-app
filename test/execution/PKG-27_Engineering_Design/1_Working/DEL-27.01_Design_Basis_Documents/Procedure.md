# Procedure: DEL-27.01 Design Basis Documents

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for producing and managing **Design Basis Documents** within **PKG-27 Engineering Design**.

**Scope:** Documents analysis and results for design basis documents required for design verification and approvals (per _CONTEXT.md).

**Deliverable type:** Report (Design Basis Memorandum, Design Criteria)

**Responsible party:** D&B Contractor

**Downstream use:** The Design Basis Documents establish the technical foundation for all subsequent engineering design work across all disciplines. These documents are critical inputs for detailed engineering (packages PKG-01 through PKG-26, PKG-29 through PKG-36) and design verification (DEL-28.01).

**Key upstream dependencies (coordination required):**
- Employer's Requirements (all volumes) — must be available and reviewed before design basis development can proceed
- Project objectives and success criteria — established in project initiation documentation
- Permit conditions and regulatory requirements — obtained by Employer, provided to Contractor
- Site investigation data — geotechnical, environmental, survey data as available
- **TBD** — Specific upstream deliverables to be confirmed per project schedule

**Key parallel dependencies (coordination required during development):**
- DEL-27.02 (HAZOP Study Reports) — safety requirements and hazardous area classification inform design criteria
- DEL-27.03 (Phase 2 Expansion Documentation) — Phase 2 interface requirements inform Phase 1 design provisions
- DEL-27.04 (Design Submission Packages) — submission stage requirements and schedule
- All discipline engineering leads — multi-discipline input required for comprehensive design criteria
