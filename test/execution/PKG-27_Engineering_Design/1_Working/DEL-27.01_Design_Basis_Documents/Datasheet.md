## Construction

**Anticipated Artifacts:**

Per _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-27.01 entry:
1. **Design Basis Memorandum** — Foundation document establishing design philosophy, key decisions, and technical approach
2. **Design Criteria** — Performance requirements, design parameters, load cases, environmental conditions, applicable codes/standards

**Document Structure (typical for Design & Build):**

Design Basis Memorandum typically includes:
- Project overview and scope
- Design philosophy and approach
- Key technical decisions and rationale
- Interface requirements
- Phase 2 expansion considerations (per OBJ-8)
- Assumptions and exclusions
- **TBD** — Detailed table of contents to be developed

Design Criteria typically includes:
- Performance requirements (throughput, storage, operational flexibility per OBJ-2, OBJ-3, OBJ-4)
- Design loads and environmental conditions
- Material specifications
- Safety and regulatory compliance requirements (per OBJ-1, OBJ-6)
- Code and standard references
- Quality assurance requirements
- **TBD** — Detailed table of contents to be developed
