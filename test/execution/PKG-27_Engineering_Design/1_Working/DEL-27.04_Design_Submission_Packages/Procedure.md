# Procedure: DEL-27.04 Design Submission Packages

## Purpose

Defines process for producing **Design Submission Packages** within **PKG-27 Engineering Design**. Establishes submission planning, compilation, QA, transmittal, and comment management for staged submissions (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC).

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md; Specification.md

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** DEL-27.04 coordinates all 210 project deliverables; discipline teams provide deliverables at required maturity
**References:** Contract, Employer's Requirements, Project Schedule, QMS, Document Management Plan — **TBD**
**Personnel:** Project Document Control Lead, Project Manager, Discipline Leads, QA

**Source:** Specification.md; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard submission team roles

## Steps

### Step 1: Develop Submission Plan
- Define deliverable lists for each stage (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC) based on design maturity and Employer priorities
- Define maturity criteria per stage per Datasheet.md
- Develop submission schedule aligned with project milestones
- Obtain Employer review and approval of submission plan

**Outputs:** Submission Plan approved by PM and Employer

### Step 2: Prepare for Each Submission

**2.1 Notify Discipline Teams** (4-6 weeks before submission)
- Notify teams of upcoming submission and deliverable list
- Confirm deliverable maturity targets and completion dates

**2.2 Monitor Deliverable Readiness** (ongoing)
- Track deliverable status; identify delays early
- Escalate issues to PM if deliverables at risk

**2.3 Conduct Pre-Submission Review** (1-2 weeks before submission)
- Discipline leads review their deliverables for completeness, quality, maturity
- Identify and resolve gaps before compilation

**Outputs:** Deliverables ready for compilation

### Step 3: Compile Submission Package

**3.1 Collect Deliverables**
- Gather all deliverables per submission list (correct revisions, approved status)
- Organize by discipline/package in logical structure

**3.2 Prepare Submission Documents**
- **Transmittal Letter:** Summary of submission, stage, key highlights, outstanding issues
- **Deliverable Register:** List of all deliverables with document number, revision, title, discipline, status
- **Comment Response Matrix:** (60%, 90%, IFC only) Responses to previous Employer comments
- **Outstanding Issues Log:** Known TBDs, assumptions, items requiring Employer clarification

**3.3 Perform QA Check**
- Verify all deliverables in register are included
- Verify correct revisions and approved status
- Verify formatting, naming, organization per standards
- QA Lead signs off on package completeness

**Outputs:** Compiled submission package ready for transmittal

### Step 4: Submit to Employer

**4.1 Transmit Package**
- Upload to project DMS or transmit per agreed method — **TBD**
- Send transmittal letter to Employer with package access instructions
- Confirm Employer receipt

**4.2 Distribute Internally**
- Notify PM, discipline leads, and stakeholders of submission
- Provide access to submitted package for reference

**Outputs:** Submission transmitted; Employer acknowledges receipt

### Step 5: Manage Employer Review and Comments

**5.1 Receive Comments**
- Employer issues comments per review schedule (typical 3-4 weeks)
- Log all comments in comment response matrix

**5.2 Triage and Assign Comments**
- Triage: Editorial, Technical, Contractual
- Assign to responsible discipline leads or PM
- Set response deadlines (typical 2-4 weeks)

**5.3 Develop Comment Responses**
- Assigned parties develop technically sound responses
- Responses address comment directly; provide justification if not incorporated
- Identify design changes required to implement comments

**5.4 Internal Review of Responses**
- PM and discipline leads review responses for adequacy
- Resolve any internal disagreements before submission to Employer

**5.5 Submit Comment Responses to Employer**
- Compile comment response matrix with all responses
- Identify deliverables revised to address comments (new revisions)
- Transmit to Employer for concurrence

**5.6 Obtain Employer Concurrence**
- Employer reviews responses; may request clarifications or additional analysis
- Iterate as needed until Employer concurs with responses

**5.7 Implement Comments in Design**
- Discipline teams implement agreed comment resolutions in design deliverables
- Update deliverables to next revision
- Verify implementation complete before closing comments

**5.8 Close Comments**
- Update comment response matrix: Status = Closed; Evidence = revised deliverable reference
- Retain closed comments for audit trail

**Outputs:** All comments resolved and closed; design updated per comment resolutions

### Step 6: Obtain Employer Approval

- After comment resolution, request Employer formal approval/acceptance of submission stage
- Employer issues approval letter or acceptance (contractual milestone)
- Proceed to next submission stage or construction (IFC)

**Outputs:** Employer approval obtained; submission stage complete

### Step 7: Iterate for Next Submission Stage

- Repeat Steps 2-6 for next submission stage (60%, 90%, IFC)
- Each subsequent submission includes comment responses from previous stage
- Final IFC submission is comprehensive (all 210 deliverables at final approved status)

**Source:** Specification.md; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard Design & Build submission cycle

## Verification

- Submission plan approved
- Packages complete per QA checklist
- Comments resolved with implementation evidence
- Employer approval obtained for each stage

**Source:** Specification.md

## Records

**Outputs:** 30%, 60%, 90%, IFC packages
**Supporting:** Submission plan, deliverable registers, comment matrices, transmittals, QA checklists, Employer approvals
**Filing:** Packages in project DMS; copies in `2_Checking/To/` (outgoing) and `2_Checking/From/` (incoming comments)

**Source:** Specification.md; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard deliverable lifecycle per AGENTS.md
