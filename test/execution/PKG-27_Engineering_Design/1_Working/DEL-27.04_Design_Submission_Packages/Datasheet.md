**Staged Submission Approach:**

Design & Build projects typically use staged submissions to allow Employer review and approval as design matures:

**30% Design Submission:**
- **Timing:** Early design stage; conceptual/preliminary design complete
- **Purpose:** Establish design approach, key decisions, major equipment selections; obtain Employer direction before detailed engineering
- **Maturity:** Conceptual layouts, preliminary P&IDs, equipment lists, major system descriptions, design basis documents
- **Deliverables:** Selected deliverables providing overall project understanding (not all 210 deliverables)
- **Review focus:** Design philosophy, major technical decisions, compliance with Employer's Requirements, regulatory path
- **TBD** — Specific 30% submission deliverable list and schedule

**60% Design Submission:**
- **Timing:** Mid-design stage; detailed engineering underway
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate design progress, refine design based on 30% comments, identify and resolve major issues before 90%
- **Maturity:** Detailed P&IDs, equipment specifications (near-final), major calculations, control philosophy, HAZOP (preliminary)
- **Deliverables:** Expanded deliverable list; most packages represented
- **Review focus:** Technical adequacy, equipment specifications, safety (HAZOP), constructability, interfaces
- **TBD** — Specific 60% submission deliverable list and schedule

**90% Design Submission:**
- **Timing:** Late design stage; detailed engineering substantially complete
- **Purpose:** Final design review before IFC; address all outstanding technical issues; obtain final Employer approval
- **Maturity:** Final P&IDs, final equipment specs and datasheets, detailed calculations, HAZOP (detailed), construction drawings (near-final)
- **Deliverables:** Comprehensive package; all deliverables at near-final maturity
- **Review focus:** Final design verification, compliance confirmation, readiness for construction, outstanding action items
- **TBD** — Specific 90% submission deliverable list and schedule

**IFC (Issued for Construction) Submission:**
- **Timing:** Design complete; ready for construction
- **Purpose:** Authorize construction; provide construction-ready documents; establish design baseline for as-built
- **Maturity:** Final approved design; all comments resolved; all regulatory approvals obtained
- **Deliverables:** All 210 deliverables in final IFC status
- **Review focus:** Verification that all 90% comments addressed; formal acceptance for construction
- **TBD** — IFC submission deliverable list (all deliverables) and schedule

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Standard Design & Build staged submission stages and maturity levels; **TBD** — Project-specific submission requirements from Employer's Requirements or contract

**Submission Package Composition (Typical):**

Each submission package typically includes:
- **Transmittal letter:** Summary of submission, stage, key changes since previous submission, outstanding issues
- **Deliverable register:** List of all deliverables in package with revision, status, discipline
- **Design documents:** Drawings, specifications, calculations, reports, datasheets per deliverable list
- **Comment response matrix:** (60%, 90%, IFC only) Responses to Employer comments from previous submission
- **Outstanding issues log:** Known issues, TBDs, assumptions requiring Employer input or clarification
- **Regulatory compliance matrix:** (if required) Demonstration of compliance with permits, codes, standards

**Format:** Electronic submission via project document management system or file transfer — **TBD**; Physical copies if required — **TBD**

## Construction

**Anticipated Artifacts:**

Per _CONTEXT.md and decomposition DEL-27.04 entry:
1. **30% Design Package** — Early-stage design submission
2. **60% Design Package** — Mid-stage design submission
3. **90% Design Package** — Near-final design submission
4. **IFC Package** — Final issued-for-construction design submission

**DEL-27.04 Deliverable Scope:**

DEL-27.04 is meta-deliverable defining the submission process and package composition. The actual engineering content in each submission package comes from all other project deliverables (DEL-00.01 through DEL-36.xx, excluding DEL-27.04 itself).

**DEL-27.04 outputs:**
- **Submission Plan:** Defines what deliverables are included in each submission stage (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC), timing, responsibilities
- **Submission Procedures:** Processes for compiling, reviewing, transmitting, tracking submission packages
- **Submission Templates:** Transmittal letter template, deliverable register template, comment response matrix template
- **Submission Schedule:** Dates for each submission stage coordinated with overall project schedule
- **Quality Requirements:** Review/approval workflows, QA/QC for submission packages
- **Comment Management Process:** How Employer comments are received, triaged, assigned, resolved, verified

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md; **ASSUMPTION**: DEL-27.04 defines submission management framework, not engineering content
