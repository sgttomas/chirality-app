# Specification: DEL-27.04 Design Submission Packages

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for **Design Submission Packages** within **PKG-27 Engineering Design**.

**Purpose:** Defines and substantiates design submission packages in accordance with ER requirements; establishes submission process, content, timing, and quality requirements for staged design submissions (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC).

**Anticipated deliverable artifacts:**
- 30% Design Package, 60% Design Package, 90% Design Package, IFC Package

**Scope:** DEL-27.04 defines submission framework for all 210 project deliverables; actual engineering content comes from respective deliverables.
