#### IF-01: Integration with Design Drawings (DEL-22.01)

Shop drawings shall:
- Reference design drawing numbers and details
- Maintain design intent and arrangement
- Resolve any ambiguities or conflicts in design drawings (via RFI process if needed)

**Rationale**: Shop drawings are subordinate to design drawings but provide detail

**Verification**: See Procedure.md, Step 3 (engineer review)

**Source:** Standard shop drawing relationship to design drawings

#### IF-02: Compliance with Specifications (DEL-22.02)

Shop drawings shall demonstrate compliance with specifications:
- Materials and equipment per specifications
