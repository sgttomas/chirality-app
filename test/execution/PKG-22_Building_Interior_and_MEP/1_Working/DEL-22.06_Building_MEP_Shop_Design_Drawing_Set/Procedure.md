## Steps

### Step 1: Vendor Shop Drawing Preparation

**Objective**: Vendor prepares shop drawings based on design documents.

**Requirements Addressed**: Establishes shop drawing content per FR-02 (fabrication details), FR-03 (coordination), FR-04 (compliance).

**Activities**:

1.1. **Review Contract Documents**:
   - Vendor reviews DEL-22.01 design drawings to understand design intent and arrangement
   - Vendor reviews DEL-22.02 specifications to understand material and performance requirements
   - Vendor reviews DEL-22.04 equipment data sheets to understand equipment parameters
   - Vendor identifies any ambiguities or conflicts requiring clarification (RFI process)

1.2. **Prepare Shop Drawings**:
   - Develop detailed fabrication drawings showing dimensions, materials, connections, and assembly
   - Show coordination with building structure and other systems (based on design drawings)
   - Include all required views, sections, and details for fabrication and installation
   - Provide equipment data and performance information (reference DEL-22.04)

1.3. **Internal Quality Check**:
   - Vendor's internal QA/QC checks shop drawings for completeness and accuracy
   - Verify compliance with design drawings and specifications
   - Verify all dimensions and specifications are complete

1.4. **Submit to Contractor**:
   - Vendor submits shop drawings to contractor with transmittal
   - Identify any deviations from design or specification (if any) and provide justification

**Verification**: Vendor internal QA sign-off; ready for contractor review.

**Source:** Standard vendor shop drawing preparation process

### Step 2: Contractor Review and Submittal Preparation

**Objective**: Contractor reviews shop drawings and submits to engineer.

**Requirements Addressed**: Contractor quality control before submittal; supports FR-01 (submittal process).

**Activities**:

2.1. **Contractor Review**:
   - Contractor reviews shop drawings for general compliance with contract documents
   - Verify shop drawings reference correct design drawing numbers and details
   - Verify submittal is complete (all required drawings and data included)
   - Identify any obvious issues or non-compliance

2.2. **Coordination Check**:
   - Verify shop drawings coordinate with other trades (to extent visible on shop drawings)
   - Flag any potential coordination conflicts for engineer review

2.3. **Prepare Submittal Package**:
   - Assemble shop drawing package with transmittal form
   - Complete transmittal identifying:
     - Submittal number and date
     - Vendor name and drawing numbers
     - Design drawing references
     - Submittal status (initial, revision, resubmittal)
   - Update submittal tracking log

2.4. **Submit to Engineer**:
   - Submit specified number of copies (or electronic submittals per project procedures) — **TBD**
   - Submit with adequate review time per project schedule (typical: submit allowing 10-15 working days for review before fabrication must start)

**Verification**: Contractor submittal coordinator sign-off; submittal transmitted to engineer.

**Source:** Standard contractor submittal coordination; Specification.md FR-01

### Step 3: Engineer Review and Approval

**Objective**: Engineer reviews shop drawings and returns with comments.

**Requirements Addressed**: Executes FR-04 (compliance verification), FR-03 (coordination check), addresses all interface requirements (IF-01 through IF-03), implements QR-01/02 (review and stamping).

**Activities**:

3.1. **Initial Review**:
   - Engineer receives submittal and logs receipt date
   - Assign to appropriate discipline engineer for review
   - Distribute to other disciplines if multi-discipline coordination required

3.2. **Technical Review**:
   - **Design Compliance** (FR-04, IF-01): Verify shop drawing complies with DEL-22.01 design intent and arrangement
   - **Specification Compliance** (FR-04, IF-02): Verify materials, equipment, and methods comply with DEL-22.02 specifications
   - **Performance Verification** (FR-04): Verify equipment and systems will meet DEL-22.03 calculated performance and DEL-22.04 data sheet requirements
   - **Fabrication Details** (FR-02): Verify fabrication details are adequate and comply with standards (SMACNA, NFPA 13, etc.)
   - **Coordination** (FR-03, IF-03): Verify coordination with building structure (PKG-21) and other systems (PKG-17, PKG-19)
   - **Code Compliance**: Verify compliance with NBC 2020, NFPA 13, and applicable codes

3.3. **Prepare Review Comments**:
   - Mark up shop drawings with comments, corrections, and clarifications
   - Categorize comments:
     - **Critical**: Must be corrected before approval
     - **Non-Critical**: Should be corrected but may not require resubmittal depending on significance

3.4. **Stamp and Return** (QR-02):
   - Apply review stamp with one of:
     - **Approved** — Fabricate and install as shown (no changes required)
     - **Approved as Noted** — Incorporate noted corrections and proceed (no resubmittal required unless noted otherwise)
     - **Revise and Resubmit** — Revise per comments and resubmit for review (do not fabricate)
     - **Rejected** — Does not comply; major revisions required; resubmit

3.5. **Return to Contractor**:
   - Return shop drawings with stamp and comments
   - Update submittal tracking log with review status and return date
   - If revisions required, specify resubmittal requirements

**Verification**: Engineer review sign-off; shop drawings returned to contractor within specified timeframe (typically 10-15 working days).

### Step 4: Revision and Resubmittal (if required)

**Objective**: Vendor revises shop drawings per engineer comments and resubmits.

**Activities**:

4.1. **Review Engineer Comments**:
   - Vendor and contractor review engineer comments
   - Clarify any unclear comments with engineer (via RFI if necessary)
   - Develop revision plan

4.2. **Revise Shop Drawings**:
   - Vendor revises shop drawings to address all engineer comments
   - Update revision number and date on shop drawings
   - Flag or cloud revised areas on shop drawings for easy identification

4.3. **Resubmit**:
   - Contractor resubmits revised shop drawings following same process (Step 2)
   - Transmittal identifies this as resubmittal and references previous submittal
   - Provide response to comments documenting how each comment was addressed

4.4. **Repeat Review**:
   - Engineer reviews resubmittal focusing on revisions
   - If acceptable, stamp "Approved" or "Approved as Noted"
   - If still unacceptable, stamp "Revise and Resubmit" again (another resubmittal iteration)

**Verification**: Iterative process continues until engineer approval obtained.

### Step 5: Fabrication and Installation

**Objective**: Fabricate and install per approved shop drawings.

**Activities**:

5.1. **Fabrication Authorization**:
   - After engineer approval, vendor authorized to fabricate
   - Vendor fabricates equipment/materials per approved shop drawings
   - Any field changes or deviations require RFI and potential shop drawing revision

5.2. **Installation**:
   - Field installation per approved shop drawings
   - Field inspections verify installation matches approved shop drawings
   - Any deviations documented and approved via RFI or field change process

5.3. **As-Built Documentation**:
   - Contractor maintains approved shop drawings as part of project as-built documentation
   - Any field changes marked on shop drawings as red-line revisions
   - Final as-built shop drawings included in project closeout package delivered to owner

5.4. **Record Management**:
   - File approved shop drawings in `3_Issued/` folder
   - Maintain submittal tracking log with all submittals, reviews, and approvals

**Verification**: Installation per approved shop drawings verified during construction and DEL-22.05 testing.
