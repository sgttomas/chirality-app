- **Fabrication guidance** for vendors and fabricators
- **Coordination verification** before fabrication begins
- **Quality control** through engineer review
- **Installation reference** for field installation
- **Record documentation** of as-fabricated conditions

**Deliverable Classification:**
- **Type:** Drawing
- **Discipline:** Buildings
- **Responsible Party:** D&B Contractor (Suppliers/Subcontractors prepare; contractor submits)

## Principles

### Shop Drawing Submittal Process

**Standard Workflow:**

1. **Vendor Selection**: Contractor selects vendors/fabricators and awards purchase orders/subcontracts
2. **Shop Drawing Preparation**: Vendor prepares shop drawings based on DEL-22.01 design drawings and DEL-22.02 specifications
3. **Contractor Review**: Contractor reviews shop drawings for completeness and compliance before submitting to engineer
4. **Engineer Review**: Engineer reviews shop drawings and returns with comments (typically 10-15 working days)
5. **Revision** (if required): Vendor revises shop drawings per engineer comments and resubmits
6. **Approval**: After approval, vendor fabricates per approved shop drawings
7. **Fabrication**: Vendor fabricates equipment/materials per approved shop drawings
8. **Installation**: Field installation per approved shop drawings

**Source:** Standard construction submittal process

### Shop Drawing Content Requirements

**What Shop Drawings Must Show:**

- **Exact Dimensions**: Not "typical" or "approximate" — precise dimensions for fabrication
- **Material Specifications**: Specific materials, gauges, grades (must match DEL-22.02 specifications)
- **Connections and Joints**: How pieces connect together (welds, bolts, gaskets, etc.)
- **Installation Sequence**: If order of assembly is critical
- **Support and Hanging**: Locations and types of supports
- **Field vs. Shop Assembly**: What is assembled in shop vs. assembled on site
- **Equipment Data**: Performance curves, utility connections, rigging weights

**What Shop Drawings Do Not Need to Show:**

- **Means and Methods**: How vendor will safely fabricate or install (contractor responsibility)
- **Design Calculations**: Engineer's calculations already documented in DEL-22.03
- **Specification Text**: Shop drawings reference specifications but don't repeat entire spec

**Source:** Standard shop drawing content expectations

### Design Compliance Verification

**Engineer Reviews for Compliance:**

- **Design Intent**: Does shop drawing maintain design intent from DEL-22.01?
- **Performance**: Will fabricated item perform per DEL-22.03 calculations and DEL-22.04 data sheets?
- **Materials**: Do materials match DEL-22.02 specifications?
- **Codes**: Does fabrication comply with NBC 2020, NFPA 13, SMACNA, etc.?
- **Coordination**: Does shop-fabricated item coordinate with structure and other systems?

### Coordination Verification Through Shop Drawings

**Coordination Checks:**

**Structural Coordination:**
- Do equipment supports and penetrations coordinate with structural framing from PKG-21?
- Are loads on structure within structural capacity?
- Are penetrations properly sleeved and waterproofed?

**MEP System Coordination:**
- Do ductwork, piping, and equipment routes avoid interferences?
- Are clearances maintained for operation and maintenance?
- Do connections align (e.g., duct connections to equipment)?

**Spatial Coordination:**
- Does equipment fit within available space shown on DEL-22.01 drawings?
- Are rigging and installation access paths clear?
- Are maintenance clearances per code and manufacturer requirements provided?

**Source:** Standard coordination review requirements

### Shop Drawing Quality Standards

**Professional Quality:**

- **Legibility**: All text and dimensions clearly legible
- **Completeness**: All required views, sections, details provided
- **Accuracy**: Dimensions accurate and consistent
- **Clarity**: Drawing conventions and symbols per standards
- **Title Block**: Complete project identification, vendor identification, drawing number, revision, date

**Poor Quality Indicators** (may result in "Revise and Resubmit"):
- Illegible or incomplete drawings
- Missing dimensions or specifications
- Conflicts or inconsistencies between views
- Does not address design drawing requirements or specification requirements

**Source:** Standard shop drawing quality expectations

### Shop Drawing Review Authority and Limitations

**What Engineer Review Means:**

- Engineer reviews for general compliance with contract documents
- Review focuses on design intent, coordination, and code compliance
- Review does not relieve vendor of responsibility for accuracy and compliance
- **Approval does not mean**: Engineer has checked every dimension, approved means and methods, or approved changes to design without change order

**What Engineer Review Does NOT Cover:**

- **Fabrication Methods**: How vendor will fabricate (welding sequence, jigs, fixtures, etc.)
- **Construction Safety**: Safety during fabrication and installation
- **Cost**: Approval does not constitute approval of cost changes
- **Warranty**: Vendor remains responsible for equipment warranties

## Considerations

### Shop Drawing Timing and Schedule Impact

**Critical Path Considerations:**

- Shop drawing review is on critical path for equipment with long fabrication lead times (HVAC equipment, fire pumps, specialty items)
- Late shop drawing submittals delay project schedule
- Inadequate shop drawings requiring multiple resubmittals delay fabrication start

**Schedule Mitigation:**
- Identify long-lead items early and prioritize shop drawing submittals
- Conduct pre-submittal meetings with vendors to clarify expectations
- Use phased submittals for large packages (submit critical items first)

**Source:** Standard construction schedule management

### Multi-Discipline Coordination

**Coordination Challenges:**

Shop drawings from different trades must coordinate:
- HVAC ductwork vs. plumbing piping vs. electrical conduit (PKG-17) vs. fire protection piping vs. structural members (PKG-21)
- Equipment locations vs. architectural finishes and door swings (PKG-21)
- Control wiring (PKG-19) routing vs. other systems

**Coordination Tools:**
- 3D coordination models (BIM clash detection if project uses BIM)
- Coordination meetings with all trades
- Dedicated coordination drawings showing all systems overlaid

**Source:** Standard multi-trade coordination practice

### Common Shop Drawing Issues

**Typical Review Comments:**

- **Does not comply with specifications**: Materials, equipment, or methods don't match DEL-22.02
- **Insufficient detail**: Not enough information for fabrication or installation
- **Coordination conflict**: Interferes with structure or other systems
- **Does not match design intent**: Deviates from DEL-22.01 design drawings without justification or approval
- **Code non-compliance**: Does not meet NBC 2020, NFPA 13, or other code requirements
- **Missing information**: Required views, dimensions, or specifications not provided

**How to Avoid Issues:**
- Vendors should carefully review design drawings and specifications before preparing shop drawings
- Conduct pre-submittal meetings to clarify requirements and expectations
- Submit complete shop drawing packages (not partial or incomplete submittals)

## Trade-offs

### Shop Drawing Review Thoroughness vs. Schedule

**Decision Point**: Level of engineer review detail vs. schedule pressure

**Trade-off**:
- **Thorough review** — Catches more issues before fabrication, reduces field problems, but takes more time
- **Fast-track review** — Faster turnaround, keeps schedule on track, but may miss issues leading to field problems

**Recommendation**:
- **Critical items** (fire protection, long-lead equipment): Thorough review even if delays schedule slightly
- **Standard items** (ductwork, standard fixtures): Standard review within specified timeframe
- **Minor items** (diffusers, accessories): Expedited review if not on critical path
- Maintain specified review timeframe (typically 10-15 working days) — rushing review increases error risk

**Source:** Balancing quality and schedule; ASSUMPTION: typical review durations

### Prefabrication vs. Field Fabrication

**Decision Point**: Prefabricate in shop vs. fabricate in field

**Trade-off**:
- **Prefabrication** — Better quality control, faster installation, reduced field labor, but requires detailed shop drawings and coordination, limited size by shipping constraints
- **Field Fabrication** — More flexible for site conditions, no shipping size limits, but lower quality control, slower installation, more field labor

**Recommendation** (for ductwork per anticipated artifact "prefab ductwork shop drawings"):
- **Prefabricate** where practical: straight runs, standard fittings, assemblies
- **Field fabricate** where necessary: final connections, field adjustments, odd sizes
- Balance based on project location (site access, labor availability) and fabrication facility capabilities
