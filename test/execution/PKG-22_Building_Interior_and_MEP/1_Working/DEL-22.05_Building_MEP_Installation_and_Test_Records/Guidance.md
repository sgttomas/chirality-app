## Principles

### Purpose of Installation and Test Records

**Documentation Philosophy:**

Testing and commissioning transform design intent into verified operating systems. Records demonstrate:
1. Installation matches design (DEL-22.01 drawings, DEL-22.02 specifications)
2. Equipment performs as specified (DEL-22.04 data sheets)
3. Systems meet performance requirements (DEL-22.03 calculations)
4. Code compliance achieved (NBC 2020, NFPA 13, etc.)

### HVAC Testing and Commissioning Requirements

**Key Tests:**

**Duct Pressure Testing** — Verifies ductwork is sealed and meets SMACNA leakage class requirements. Prevents energy waste from duct leakage.

**Air Balance (TAB)** — Measures and adjusts airflows to match design. Ensures proper ventilation and comfort. Independent TAB contractor typically required.

**Equipment Functional Performance** — Verifies heating/cooling capacity, efficiency, and control sequences. Documents baseline performance.

**Control System Functional Testing** — Verifies controls operate per design sequences (coordinate with PKG-19). Tests interlocks, alarms, and BAS integration.

**Source:** ASHRAE Guideline 1.1; SMACNA TAB standards

### Plumbing Testing Requirements

**Key Tests:**

**Pressure Testing** — Hydrostatic test of water supply piping at 1.5× operating pressure for 2 hours (or per NBC 2020). Verifies no leaks before concealment.

**Drainage Testing** — Air or water test of drainage piping per NBC 2020. Typically 5 ft water column or 5 psi air pressure for 15 minutes. Verifies proper installation and sealing.

**Backflow Preventer Testing** — Annual testing and certification required by water authority. Protects potable water supply from contamination.

**Hot Water Performance** — Verifies temperature, recovery rate, and flow meet design requirements.

### Fire Protection Testing Requirements (NFPA 13)

**Mandatory Tests:**

**Hydrostatic Testing** — 200 psi for 2 hours for steel pipe (verify per NFPA 13 for CPVC or other materials). Critical test to verify pipe integrity before system is charged.

**Main Drain Test** — Measures flow and pressure at most remote main drain. Verifies water supply is adequate for sprinkler system demand. Baseline test repeated annually.

**Trip Test** — Actuates alarm valve to verify water motor gong, bell, and supervisory signals operate correctly. Demonstrates system will alarm when activated.

**Fire Pump Testing** (if applicable) — Capacity test per NFPA 20 verifies pump delivers rated flow at rated pressure. Run test demonstrates pump operates continuously. Weekly/monthly tests required ongoing.

**AHJ Acceptance** — Fire Marshal inspection and sign-off required for sprinkler system acceptance. System cannot be turned over to owner without AHJ approval.

**Source:** NFPA 13 Chapter on Acceptance Tests; NFPA 20 for fire pump testing

### Acceptance Criteria and Performance Verification

**Acceptance Framework:**

Testing demonstrates three levels of acceptance:
1. **Installation Acceptance** — Installed per drawings and specifications
2. **Equipment Acceptance** — Equipment performs per data sheet requirements
3. **System Acceptance** — System meets design performance and code requirements

**Performance Verification:**
- Compare test results to DEL-22.03 design calculations (capacity, flow, pressure, temperature)
- Verify equipment operates within DEL-22.04 data sheet parameters
- Demonstrate code compliance per NBC 2020, NFPA 13, ASHRAE 90.1

### Quality Assurance and Witness Requirements

**Why Witnessing Matters:**

- Independent verification provides quality assurance
- Witness signatures provide accountability
- Third-party witnesses (commissioning agent, owner's representative) provide unbiased assessment
- Failed tests with witness documentation support corrective action decisions

**Witness Categories:**
- **Contractor QA/QC** — Witnesses routine tests
- **Commissioning Agent** — Witnesses critical system tests (if CxA appointed)
- **Owner's Representative** — Witnesses key acceptance tests
- **AHJ** — Witnesses fire protection system tests and provides final acceptance

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: standard quality assurance practice; ASHRAE commissioning requirements

## Considerations

### Testing Timing and Construction Coordination

**Pre-Testing Requirements:**

- Construction substantially complete
- Systems operational with utilities connected
- Punch list items affecting testing must be completed
- Safety systems (fire protection, emergency lighting) operational
- Control systems programmed and functional (coordinate with PKG-19)

**Testing Sequence:**
1. **Installation inspection** — Visual inspection and dimensional verification
2. **Component testing** — Individual equipment functional tests
3. **System testing** — Integrated system performance tests
4. **Commissioning** — Functional performance testing and optimization

**Source:** Standard commissioning sequence per ASHRAE Guideline 0

### Commissioning Process and Authority

**Commissioning Authority (CxA) Role** (if appointed):

- Develops commissioning plan and test procedures
- Witnesses critical tests
- Reviews test records and approves acceptance
- Prepares commissioning report summarizing results and issues

**Project May Have:**
- **Owner's Commissioning Agent** — Third-party CxA engaged by owner
- **Contractor Self-Commissioning** — Contractor QA/QC performs commissioning
- **TBD** — Project commissioning approach per Employer's Requirements (location TBD)

**Source:** ASHRAE Guideline 0 commissioning process; project commissioning plan TBD

### Regulatory Inspections and Code Compliance

**Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) Inspections:**

**Fire Marshal:**
- Inspects fire protection system installation
- Witnesses or reviews main drain test, trip test, and fire pump test (if applicable)
- Signs off on NFPA 13 compliance
- Issues fire protection system acceptance certificate

**Building Inspector:**
- Inspects MEP installations for NBC 2020 compliance
- May witness pressure tests and functional tests
- Signs off on building permit (MEP portion)

**Coordination:**
- Schedule AHJ inspections in advance (may require 2-4 weeks notice)
- Provide test records and documentation for AHJ review
- Address any deficiencies identified by AHJ before final acceptance

### Record Management and Quality Assurance

**Record Quality Standards:**

- **Legibility** — All handwritten entries must be legible
- **Completeness** — All required fields completed
- **Authenticity** — Original signatures (or controlled electronic signatures with audit trail)
- **Traceability** — Instrument calibration certificates attached, test procedures referenced
- **Corrections** — Any corrections initialed and dated (no whiteout or erasures)

**Electronic Records:**
- If electronic forms used, must have secure signature and audit trail
- PDF scans of signed paper forms are acceptable for archival
- Backup and retention per project requirements

## Trade-offs

### Competing Concerns to Evaluate

#### Testing Thoroughness vs. Schedule Pressure

**Decision Point**: Extent of testing vs. project schedule and cost pressure

**Trade-off**:
- **Comprehensive testing** — Catches issues before turnover, reduces future problems, provides better performance baseline, but extends schedule and increases cost
- **Minimal testing** — Meets code minimum, faster schedule, lower cost, but higher risk of undetected issues and future failures

**Recommendation**:
- Always meet code-required testing (NBC 2020, NFPA 13) — non-negotiable
- Perform functional performance testing per ASHRAE guidelines — industry standard
- **TBD** — Project commissioning scope and extent per Employer's Requirements (location TBD)

**Source:** NBC 2020, NFPA 13 mandatory testing; ASHRAE commissioning guidelines

#### Third-Party Testing vs. Contractor Self-Testing

**Decision Point**: Independent third-party testing (TAB contractor, CxA) vs. contractor self-testing

**Trade-off**:
- **Third-party** — Independent verification, greater credibility, often required by codes or lenders, but higher cost
- **Contractor self-testing** — Lower cost, faster schedule, but potential conflict of interest

**Recommendation**:
- **Air balance (TAB)** — Independent TAB contractor recommended (often required by specifications)
- **Fire protection testing** — May require third-party per NFPA 13 or AHJ requirements
- **Commissioning** — Third-party CxA provides best results but increases cost
- **TBD** — Project testing and commissioning approach per Employer's Requirements (location TBD)
