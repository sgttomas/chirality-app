# Guidance: DEL-06.05 Structural Steel Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

- Support development of the records package that provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for PKG-06 structural steelwork (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252).
- Provide interpretation so records remain traceable to drawings/specification/data sheets and support Employer/Engineer review and handover (ASSUMPTION; confirm in ER clauses).

This deliverable is a **Record** produced by **D&B Contractor (QA/QC)** (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252).

## Principles

- Traceability: each record should map to the relevant steel item/assembly and the governing requirement clause (ASSUMPTION; traceability requirements TBD).
- Completeness: ensure all anticipated record categories are captured (mill certs, weld inspection, galvanizing certificates) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252).
- Authority: use Employer’s Requirements and document control expectations as the basis for record format, approvals, and retention; clauses **TBD** until extracted (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Considerations

- Align “required records” lists with DEL-06.02 (Technical Specification) clauses and DEL-06.04 (Data Sheet Package) fields so records are not missed (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED).
- Ensure certificates/inspection reports include identifiers sufficient for traceability (heat numbers, coating batch, inspection date, inspector ID) (**TBD** exact fields).
- Package scope focus remains Contractor-only; Employer-responsible items excluded except interfaces (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).
- Use a single “record index” as the backbone; avoid relying on file naming alone for traceability (ASSUMPTION; see Specification.md: Record Index Structure).

## Trade-offs

- Centralized record package vs distributed records: centralized packages aid review but require strict indexing; distributed records reduce compilation effort but risk gaps (TBD).
- Scanned vendor certs vs structured record forms: scans are common but can hinder traceability/search; choose approach based on ER/document control requirements (**TBD**).

## Examples

- Create a records index (spreadsheet/table) listing each item ID and required record types with status (ASSUMPTION; format TBD).
- For galvanizing/coating, attach both certificates and inspection hold-point sign-offs where required (**TBD** until ER/spec clauses extracted).

## Local Conflict Table (if unresolved)

| Topic | Issue | Impact | Needed to resolve | Owner |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Record format/retention | ER clauses not yet extracted for QA record requirements | Record templates and acceptance cannot be finalized | Identify relevant ER clauses and confirm record expectations | Human |

## Cross-Document Notes

- Technical Specification (DEL-06.02): record requirements should match the inspection/acceptance clauses (DEL-06.02 Specification.md).
- Data Sheets (DEL-06.04): use “Required Records” fields to drive record completeness (DEL-06.04 Guidance.md).
- Procedure: provides the step-by-step workflow for collecting and compiling records (Procedure.md: Steps).
- Specification → Procedure → Records traceability: use the `Specification.md` Cross-Reference Matrix to keep required records, workflow, and evidence aligned.
