## Conditions

**Context & intended use:**
- This deliverable provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for structural steelwork (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252).
- Intended users: QA/QC, Employer/Engineer review, project closeout/handover teams (ASSUMPTION; confirm in ER clauses).

**Record requirements basis:** **TBD** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Construction

**Record content focus (anticipated artifacts):**

Anticipated artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252; `_CONTEXT.md`):
- Mill certificates
- Weld inspection records
- Galvanizing certificates

**Suggested package contents (ASSUMPTION / TBD):**
- Records index (item ID from DEL-06.01 / drawing reference / specification clause from DEL-06.02 / record category / record identifier / filename / date / status) (Specification.md: Record Index Structure; Procedure.md: Step 5; Guidance.md: Considerations, Examples).
- Folder structure by record category (Mill certificates / Weld inspection records / Galvanizing certificates) (TBD; Procedure.md: Step 5).
- PDF "compiled set" for review transmittal, if required (TBD; Procedure.md: Step 5).

## Cross-Document Points

- Technical Specification (DEL-06.02): record types (mill certificates, weld inspection records, galvanizing certificates) and acceptance criteria should reflect specification clauses for materials, fabrication, and protective systems (DEL-06.02 Specification.md: Quality Requirements, Records and Submittals).
- Drawings (DEL-06.01): trace records to drawing item IDs, assemblies, and critical weld/coating locations identified on drawings (DEL-06.01 Guidance.md).
- Design Calculations (DEL-06.03): critical design assumptions affecting inspection/hold points (critical welds, bolting categories, coating systems) should be traceable to record requirements (DEL-06.03 Specification.md: Cross-Document Notes; DEL-06.03 Guidance.md: Considerations).
- Data Sheets (DEL-06.04): use data sheet "Required Records" fields to ensure complete record compilation for gangway and grating items (DEL-06.04 Specification.md: Quality Requirements, Suggested Field Sets; DEL-06.04 Guidance.md: Considerations).
- Specification → Procedure → Records traceability: see `Specification.md` Cross-Reference Matrix for how requirements map to Procedure steps and evidence.
