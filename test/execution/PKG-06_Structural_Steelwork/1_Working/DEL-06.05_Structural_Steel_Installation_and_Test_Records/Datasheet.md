## Conditions

**Context & intended use:**
- This deliverable provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for structural steelwork (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252).
- Intended users: QA/QC, Employer/Engineer review, project closeout/handover teams (ASSUMPTION; confirm in ER clauses).

**Record requirements basis:** **TBD** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Construction

**Record content focus (anticipated artifacts):**

Anticipated artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252; `_CONTEXT.md`):
- Mill certificates
- Weld inspection records
- Galvanizing certificates

**Suggested package contents (ASSUMPTION / TBD):**
- Records index (item ID from DEL-06.01 / drawing reference / specification clause from DEL-06.02 / record category / record identifier / filename / date / status) (Specification.md: Record Index Structure; Procedure.md: Step 5; Guidance.md: Considerations, Examples).
- Folder structure by record category (Mill certificates / Weld inspection records / Galvanizing certificates) (TBD; Procedure.md: Step 5).
- PDF "compiled set" for review transmittal, if required (TBD; Procedure.md: Step 5).

## Cross-Document Traceability

| Document | Section | Linked Content |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Specification.md | Scope | Anticipated record artifacts (mill certs, weld inspection, galvanizing) |
| Specification.md | Record Index Structure | Index fields for traceability (item ID, drawing ref, spec clause, etc.) |
| Specification.md | Cross-Reference Matrix | Requirement-to-verification-to-evidence traceability |
| Guidance.md | Principles | Traceability, completeness, ER authority |
| Guidance.md | Considerations | Alignment with DEL-06.02/04, certificate identifiers, scope focus |
| Guidance.md | Examples | Records index and certificate organization |
| Procedure.md | Steps 1–6 | Record definition through issue preparation workflow |
| Procedure.md | Verification | Acceptance criteria for completeness, traceability, archival format |
| Procedure.md | Records | Documentation outputs matching this Datasheet's scope |

**Cross-Deliverable Consistency (PKG-06):**
- DEL-06.01: Records trace to drawing item IDs, assemblies, critical weld/coating locations
- DEL-06.02: Record acceptance criteria reflect specification clauses for materials/fabrication/coatings
- DEL-06.03: Critical design assumptions (welds, bolting, coating systems) map to inspection/record requirements
- DEL-06.04: Data sheet "Required Records" fields drive record completeness for gangway/grating items
