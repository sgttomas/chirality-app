## Conditions

**Context & intended use:**
- This deliverable defines the design arrangement and detailing for structural steelwork within the Contractor’s scope (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).
- Package scope includes steel platforms, stairs, gangways, access structures, handrails, and pipe supports (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:242).
- Intended users: engineering/design reviewers, fabricators (shop drawing development), construction/QA teams (ASSUMPTION; to be confirmed in ER clauses).

**Design/environmental criteria:** **TBD** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD). See DEL-06.03 Structural Steel Design Calculations for governing design basis, load cases, and code requirements (Specification.md: Interface Requirements; Guidance.md: Considerations).

## Construction

**Configuration focus (drawing content):**

Anticipated artifacts within this drawing set (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248; `_CONTEXT.md`):
- Platform general arrangements (GAs)
- Stair drawings
- Gangway drawings
- Pipe rack / pipe support drawings
- Handrail details

**Material definition approach:** steel member sizes, material grades, protective coatings, and connection detailing are shown and/or referenced on drawings; materials/workmanship/coating requirements cross-reference DEL-06.02 Structural Steel Technical Specification (details **TBD** until Employer's Requirements clauses and design basis are extracted) (Specification.md: Requirements; Guidance.md: Considerations).

**Linked deliverables (for traceability):**
- DEL-06.02 Structural Steel Technical Specification (materials/workmanship/coatings)
- DEL-06.03 Structural Steel Design Calculations (assumptions, load cases, governing results)
- DEL-06.04 Structural Steel Data Sheet Package (gangway/grating item sheets, where applicable)
- DEL-06.05 Structural Steel Installation & Test Records (inspection/records evidence)
