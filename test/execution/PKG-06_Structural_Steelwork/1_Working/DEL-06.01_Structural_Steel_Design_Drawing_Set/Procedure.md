# Procedure: DEL-06.01 Structural Steel Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for producing and managing the **Structural Steel Design Drawing Set** within **PKG-06 Structural Steelwork**.

The deliverable defines the design arrangement and details for structural steel per Employer’s Requirements, within the Contractor’s scope of work (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).

**Deliverable type:** Drawing  
**Responsible party:** D&B Contractor

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:**
- See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` — **NOT_TRACKED**: dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see `execution/_Coordination/_COORDINATION.md`).
- Confirm availability of design inputs (surveys, equipment layouts, foundation criteria, piping routes) through project coordination channels (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED).

**Reference materials:**
- test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (PKG-06 / DEL-06.01 definition) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:238-252).
- Employer's Requirements — relevant clauses **TBD** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf; test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

**Personnel requirements:**
- Qualified structural designer/drafter and checker per project QA/QC expectations (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Steps

1. **Confirm scope checklist** — Use the anticipated artifacts list (Platform GAs, stair drawings, gangway drawings, pipe rack drawings, handrail details) to confirm required drawing outputs (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Scope; Guidance.md: Examples).
2. **Assemble inputs** — Collect design basis inputs and interface constraints from adjacent disciplines (foundation elevations, equipment support points, piping routes) (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; Specification.md: Interface Requirements; Guidance.md: Principles).
3. **Develop arrangement** — Produce preliminary layouts showing steelwork arrangement consistent with PKG-06 scope (platforms, stairs, gangways, access structures, handrails, pipe supports) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:242; Datasheet.md: Conditions).
4. **Detailing pass** — Add sections/details sufficient for review and downstream fabrication/detailing; cross-reference DEL-06.02 (materials/workmanship/coatings), DEL-06.03 (design basis/load cases), and DEL-06.04 (gangway/grating data sheets where applicable) (**TBD** level of detail per ER clauses) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Drawing Content; Guidance.md: Considerations, Trade-offs).
5. **Metadata/document control** — Apply drawing numbers, revisioning, and issue status per project document control process; ensure title blocks match `Datasheet.md` attributes (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Documentation; Guidance.md: Examples).
6. **Self-check** — Originator checks completeness, internal consistency, and consistency with Specification/Datasheet cross-references.
   - Confirm all five artifact groups (Platform GAs, stair drawings, gangway drawings, pipe rack drawings, handrail details) are present (Specification.md: Scope; Datasheet.md: Attributes).
   - Confirm `Specification.md` "Drawing Content (Minimum)" items are addressed or explicitly marked TBD (Specification.md: Requirements).
   - Verify cross-references to DEL-06.02, DEL-06.03, DEL-06.04 are correct (Specification.md: Drawing Content; Guidance.md: Considerations).
7. **IDC / interdisciplinary review** — Confirm interfaces (foundations/equipment/piping) and clashes; document comments and resolutions (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; Specification.md: Interface Requirements; Guidance.md: Principles, Trade-offs).
8. **Independent check / approval** — Checker reviews and approver authorizes issue for CHECKING package (sign-off rules **TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Quality Requirements).

## Verification

- Scope completeness: all five anticipated artifact groups present (Platform GAs, stair drawings, gangway drawings, pipe rack drawings, handrail details) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix; Steps 1, 6).
- Drawing content minimum: title blocks, general notes (referencing DEL-06.02, DEL-06.03, DEL-06.04), interface assumptions, drawing index / sheet list (Specification.md: Drawing Content; Steps 5, 6).
- Interface verification: bases/anchor assumptions/equipment and piping support points identified and coordinated (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; Specification.md: Interface Requirements; Guidance.md: Principles; Steps 2, 7).
- Cross-references verified: DEL-06.02, DEL-06.03, DEL-06.04 references on drawings match deliverable organization (Specification.md: Interface Requirements; Datasheet.md: Construction; Guidance.md: Considerations; Steps 4, 6).
- Drafting compliance: title block/metadata match document control requirements and `Datasheet.md` attributes (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Step 5).
- Cross-check: confirm `Specification.md` Cross-Reference Matrix evidence is available for the issue package (**TBD**; Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix).

## Records

**Documentation outputs:**
- Platform GAs
- Stair drawings
- Gangway drawings
- Pipe rack drawings
- Handrail details

(Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Scope, Documentation)

**Record management:**
- Records managed per project document control procedures (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Documentation).
- Filing convention: working files remain in `1_Working/`; review/issue copies can be packaged to `2_Checking/` / `3_Issued/` as adopted by the team (Source: README.md; Datasheet.md: References).
- Revision tracking: per project numbering system and `Datasheet.md` attributes (Datasheet.md: Attributes; Step 5).
- Retention requirements: **TBD**.
