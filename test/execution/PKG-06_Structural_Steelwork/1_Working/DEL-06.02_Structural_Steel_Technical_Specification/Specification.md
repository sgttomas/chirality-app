# Specification: DEL-06.02 Structural Steel Technical Specification

## Scope

This deliverable defines the performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for structural steel within **PKG-06 Structural Steelwork** (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249).

Package scope includes steel platforms, stairs, gangways, access structures, handrails, and pipe supports (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:242). This specification applies to those items unless explicitly excluded by the Employer’s Requirements or scope focus boundaries (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).

**Anticipated artifacts (sections/volumes) within this deliverable:**
- Structural steel specification
- Handrail specification
- Grating specification

(Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Procedure.md: Steps 2, Records; Guidance.md: Considerations)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Provide a technical specification that can be used to procure, fabricate, install, and inspect structural steelwork to the Employer’s Requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249).
- Include clear requirements for (minimum) materials, fabrication/workmanship, protective treatment/coatings, erection tolerances, and inspection/testing (**TBD** details) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).
- Define requirements for handrails and gratings as distinct subsections consistent with the anticipated artifacts list (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249).
- Ensure terminology and assumptions match the drawing set (DEL-06.01), calculations (DEL-06.03), and data sheets (DEL-06.04) deliverables (ASSUMPTION; deliverable set intent, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:248-252; Datasheet.md: Construction; Procedure.md: Verification; Guidance.md: Considerations).

### Performance Requirements

- Specify performance criteria that enforce durability and fitness-for-purpose in the site environment (**TBD** numeric values and exposure class) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).
- Identify required design basis references (codes/standards, load/environmental criteria) as applicable; clauses **TBD** until extracted from ER volumes (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

### Interface Requirements

- Coordinate interface assumptions to foundations, equipment, piping, and electrical supports through external coordination workflows; dependencies are not tracked in-file (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`) (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED).
- Where Employer-responsible items exist, specify only interface connection requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).
- Require that drawing notes (DEL-06.01) and datasheets (DEL-06.04) reference this specification for material and workmanship controls (ASSUMPTION; cross-document traceability; Datasheet.md: Construction; Guidance.md: Principles, Examples).

### Quality Requirements

- Include acceptance criteria and hold points suitable for QA/QC verification and record compilation (mill certificates, weld inspection records, galvanizing certificates) aligned to DEL-06.05 Structural Steel Installation & Test Records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252; Datasheet.md: Construction; Procedure.md: Step 4; Guidance.md: Principles, Considerations).
- Align document control, review/check, and revision/approval requirements to the Employer’s Requirements general requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

### Records and Submittals (Minimum)

The decomposition identifies these record categories for structural steelwork QA/QC evidence (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252). Specific ER-required formats and acceptance criteria remain **TBD** until extracted (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

| Category | Minimum expected content (TBD) | Delivered via |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| Mill certificates | Heat numbers, material grade, compliance statement, traceability to items (**TBD**) | DEL-06.05 record package |
| Weld inspection records | WPS/WPQR references, welder ID, inspection method/results, repairs (**TBD**) | DEL-06.05 record package |
| Galvanizing certificates | Coating system identification, batch/lot, thickness/inspection results (**TBD**) | DEL-06.05 record package |

## Standards

- Governing codes/standards for structural steelwork, handrails, and gratings are **TBD** until extracted from Employer’s Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Verification

- Technical review: confirm inclusion of all required sections and that clauses are traceable to Employer’s Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).
- Interdisciplinary review: confirm interfaces and terminology align with drawings/calculations (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED).
- Compliance matrix / traceability table: map key requirements to verification method and required records (**TBD** format) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Cross-Reference Matrix (Specification → Procedure → Records)

| Requirement area | Primary procedure step(s) | Evidence / record type |
|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Required sections present (Structural steel specification, Handrail specification, Grating specification) | Procedure.md: Step 2 | Reviewed draft with section checklist (**TBD** format; Datasheet.md: Attributes) |
| Clause traceability to ER | Procedure.md: Step 1 | ER clause register / citation list (**TBD**; Guidance.md: Principles) |
| Materials, workmanship, performance, inspection clauses | Procedure.md: Step 3 | Draft specification with TBDs marked (Guidance.md: Considerations) |
| Acceptance criteria and hold points defined | Procedure.md: Steps 3–4 | Inspection/hold point schedule (**TBD**) |
| Record types called up by clauses (verification & records alignment) | Procedure.md: Step 4 | DEL-06.05 record package: mill certificates, weld inspection records, galvanizing certificates (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252; Datasheet.md: Construction; Guidance.md: Examples) |
| Interdisciplinary review (interfaces validated) | Procedure.md: Step 5 | IDC comments / resolutions (**TBD**; Guidance.md: Considerations) |
| Document control applied | Procedure.md: Step 6 | Revision history / approvals (**TBD**; Datasheet.md: Attributes) |
