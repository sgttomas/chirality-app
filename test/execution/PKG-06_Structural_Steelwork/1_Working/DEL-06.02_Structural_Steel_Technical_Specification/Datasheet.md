## Conditions

**Context & intended use:**
- This deliverable defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for PKG-06 structural steelwork, within the Contractor’s scope (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).
- Package scope includes steel platforms, stairs, gangways, access structures, handrails, and pipe supports (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:242).
- Intended users: engineering reviewers, procurement, fabricators, construction, QA/QC (ASSUMPTION; confirm in ER clauses).

**Design/environmental criteria referenced by this spec:** **TBD** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Construction

**Specification content focus (anticipated artifacts):**

Anticipated artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249; `_CONTEXT.md`):
- Structural steel specification
- handrail specification
- grating specification

**Linked deliverables (for traceability):**
- DEL-06.01 Structural Steel Design Drawing Set (drawing notes reference this specification for materials/workmanship/coatings)
- DEL-06.03 Structural Steel Design Calculations (design basis assumptions/load cases referenced by performance requirements in this spec)
- DEL-06.04 Structural Steel Data Sheet Package (gangway/grating data sheet fields reflect requirements from this spec)
- DEL-06.05 Structural Steel Installation & Test Records (mill certificates, weld inspection records, galvanizing certificates evidencing compliance) (Specification.md: Records and Submittals; Guidance.md: Principles, Examples)
