# Procedure: DEL-06.02 Structural Steel Technical Specification

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for producing and managing the **Structural Steel Technical Specification** within **PKG-06 Structural Steelwork**.

The deliverable defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for structural steel per Employer’s Requirements, within the Contractor’s scope of work (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49).

**Deliverable type:** Specification  
**Responsible party:** D&B Contractor

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:**
- See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` — **NOT_TRACKED**: dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see `execution/_Coordination/_COORDINATION.md`).
- Confirm availability of the design basis inputs needed to write enforceable clauses (loads/exposure categories, coating requirements, inspection regime) (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED).

**Reference materials:**
- test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md (PKG-06 / DEL-06.02 definition) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:238-252).
- Employer's Requirements — relevant clauses **TBD** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf; test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

**Personnel requirements:**
- Qualified specification writer and checker per project QA/QC expectations (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).

## Steps

1. **Requirements extraction** — Identify the governing ER clauses for structural steel, handrails, and gratings; create ER clause register / citation list (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix; Guidance.md: Principles).
2. **Outline structure** — Create sections matching the anticipated artifacts list (Structural steel specification, Handrail specification, Grating specification) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Scope; Guidance.md: Considerations, Trade-offs).
3. **Draft clauses** — Write material/workmanship/performance/inspection clauses, explicitly marking **TBD** where ER-based values are missing; ensure terminology aligns with DEL-06.01, DEL-06.03, DEL-06.04 (Specification.md: Requirements; Guidance.md: Considerations).
4. **Define verification & records** — For each major clause, define the verification method and required records/submittals (mill certificates, weld inspection records, galvanizing certificates), aligned to DEL-06.05 Structural Steel Installation & Test Records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:252; Specification.md: Records and Submittals, Cross-Reference Matrix; Guidance.md: Principles, Considerations, Examples).
5. **Internal review** — Discipline check + interdisciplinary review to validate interfaces and terminology consistency with drawings/calculations/datasheets (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix; Guidance.md: Considerations).
6. **Issue preparation** — Apply document control metadata and revisioning per project requirements; ensure `Datasheet.md` attributes match specification document number and revision (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Documentation).
   - Confirm `Specification.md` Cross-Reference Matrix and "Records and Submittals" table are coherent and complete for issue (Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix, Records and Submittals).

## Verification

- Completeness check: all three required sections (Structural steel specification, Handrail specification, Grating specification) are present and traceable to ER clauses (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_3_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Scope, Cross-Reference Matrix; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Steps 1, 2).
- Materials/workmanship/performance/inspection clauses drafted: TBDs marked where ER values missing (Specification.md: Requirements; Step 3).
- Verification & records alignment: each major requirement maps to verification method and record type (mill certificates, weld inspection records, galvanizing certificates for DEL-06.05) (Specification.md: Records and Submittals, Cross-Reference Matrix; Step 4).
- Consistency check: terminology and assumptions align with drawing (DEL-06.01), calculation (DEL-06.03), and datasheet (DEL-06.04) deliverables (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; Specification.md: Functional Requirements; Guidance.md: Considerations; Steps 3, 5).
- Traceability check: ER clause register / citation list complete (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix; Step 1).
- Cross-check: confirm `Specification.md` Cross-Reference Matrix evidence is available for the issue package (**TBD**; Specification.md: Cross-Reference Matrix; Step 6).

## Records

**Documentation outputs:**
- Structural steel specification
- Handrail specification
- Grating specification

(Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:249; Datasheet.md: Attributes; Specification.md: Scope, Documentation)

**Record management:**
- Records managed per project document control procedures (**TBD**) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; Specification.md: Documentation).
- Filing convention: working files remain in `1_Working/`; review/issue copies can be packaged to `2_Checking/` / `3_Issued/` as adopted by the team (Source: README.md; Datasheet.md: References).
- Revision tracking: per project numbering system and `Datasheet.md` attributes (Datasheet.md: Attributes; Step 6).
- Retention requirements: **TBD**.
