# Procedure: DEL-35.05 Defects Liability Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Process for managing defects liability period — documenting defects identified during warranty period after handover and their rectification.

*Source: _CONTEXT.md*

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies**: Handover complete (DEL-35.03), facility operational under Employer control, defects liability period commenced (Taking Over Date)

*Cross-reference DEL-35.03*

**Reference Materials**:
- Design & Build Contract (defects liability/warranty clauses, response time requirements)
- Outstanding defects list from handover (DEL-35.03 punch list)
- Project documentation (for defect investigation and rectification)

**Personnel**:
- Contractor project manager (defects liability manager)
- Contractor QA/QC (defect assessment and rectification verification)
- Discipline specialists (as needed for defect rectification)
- Employer representative (defect notification, acceptance)

**Communication Protocol**: Establish Contractor-Employer communication protocol (defect notification process, site access requests, emergency contact)

## Steps

**Phase 1: Defects Liability Period Startup (Immediately Post-Handover)**
1. Establish Contractor defects liability management team and contact information
2. Brief Employer on defect notification process (how to report defects to Contractor)
3. Create defects liability register (initiate with outstanding defects from handover punch list)
4. Prioritize completion of outstanding defects from handover
5. Establish site access coordination process with Employer

**Phase 2: Defect Notification and Assessment (Throughout Defects Liability Period)**
1. Employer notifies Contractor of defect (defect notification form)
2. Log defect in defects liability register (assign defect ID, record notification date)
3. Contractor assesses defect within contract response time:
   - Inspect defect (request site access if needed)
   - Determine root cause
   - Assess warranty determination (Contractor responsibility vs. Employer issue vs. OEM warranty)
   - Classify urgency (emergency/urgent/routine)
   - Develop rectification work scope and plan
   - Estimate rectification duration
4. Communicate assessment to Employer (confirm responsibility, provide rectification plan and schedule)
5. If warranty dispute (Contractor believes not Contractor responsibility), document position and negotiate resolution with Employer

**Phase 3: Defect Rectification (As Scheduled)**
1. Coordinate site access with Employer (work authorization, permits)
2. Mobilize personnel, materials, equipment for rectification
3. Perform rectification work (document work activities, photographs before/during/after)
4. Perform testing/verification of rectified defect (functional test, safety test)
5. Contractor QA/QC inspection (certify rectification complete per standard)
6. Update defects liability register (rectification complete, pending Employer acceptance)

**Phase 4: Employer Acceptance (After Rectification)**
1. Request Employer inspection of rectified defect
2. Employer inspects rectified defect
3. Employer performs acceptance testing (if required)
4. Employer provides acceptance sign-off (defect closed) or requests additional work
5. If additional work requested, repeat Phase 3
6. Update defects liability register (defect closed, acceptance date recorded)

**Phase 5: Warranty Claims Management (As Needed)**
1. If Employer files warranty claim, document claim and respond per contract
2. If Contractor passes warranty claim to OEM/supplier, coordinate OEM rectification work
3. Document claim determination, resolution, and closure

**Phase 6: Defects Liability Period Closure (End of Period)**
1. Compile defects liability records (all defect notifications, rectification records, acceptance sign-offs)
2. Prepare defects liability period closure report:
   - Summary of defects identified and rectified
   - Response time performance
   - Employer satisfaction
   - Any unresolved defects (with explanation and proposed resolution)
3. Submit closure report to Employer
4. Request Employer acceptance that warranty obligations fulfilled
5. Resolve any disputed items through contract dispute resolution
6. Archive defects liability records per contract retention requirements (typically 2-3 years post-period for disputes)

## Verification

**VM-01**: All defects rectified or documented for resolution (defects register complete)
**VM-02**: All rectified defects inspected and accepted by Employer (acceptance sign-offs)
**VM-03**: Defects register accurate and current throughout period
**VM-04**: Contract response times met (track and document performance)

## Records

**Outputs**: Defect notification forms, defect assessment records, rectification work orders, test/completion records, Employer acceptance sign-offs, warranty claim records, defects liability register, defects liability period closure report

**Management**:
- Records filed throughout defects liability period in defects register
- Compiled at period end (closure report package)
- Retained per contract (typically 2-3 years post-period minimum)
- Employer receives copy of closure report and final defects register

*Cross-reference DEL-35.03 for warranty period commencement date*
