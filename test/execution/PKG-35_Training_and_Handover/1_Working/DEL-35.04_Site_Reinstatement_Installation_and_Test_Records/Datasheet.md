## Attributes

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Record Purpose | Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for site reinstatement — documenting removal of temporary facilities and site restoration |
| Record Category | Site Clearance and Reinstatement Records |
| Reinstatement Scope | Removal of temporary construction facilities, laydown areas, site offices, and restoration of disturbed areas to agreed condition |
| Site Context | Fraser Surrey Terminal (active marine terminal) — site reinstatement must minimize terminal disruption per **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity** |
| Record Format | **ASSUMPTION**: Checklists, inspection forms, and photographic evidence |
| Record Number | **TBD** — Per project record management numbering system |
| Retention Period | **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**: Minimum facility operational life or per regulatory requirements |
| Classification | **ASSUMPTION**: Contractor Confidential during project; transferred to Employer at handover |

## Conditions

**Site Reinstatement Context:**

Site reinstatement records document that the construction site has been cleared and restored prior to handover (cross-reference DEL-35.03):
- **Temporary construction facilities removed**: Site offices, laydown areas, construction access roads, temporary utilities
- **Disturbed areas restored**: Landscaping, paving, drainage restored to agreed condition
- **Site cleanliness**: Construction debris removed, site cleaned to operational standard
- **Safety hazards eliminated**: Excavations backfilled, temporary barriers removed
- **Environmental compliance**: Contaminated soil remediated, erosion controls removed after stabilization

**Project Location**: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC (active terminal)

*Source: Decomposition Section 1.1 (Project Overview), Section 2 (OBJ-5)*

**Terminal Continuity Consideration (OBJ-5):**
Fraser Surrey Terminal is an active marine terminal. Site reinstatement must be coordinated to minimize disruption to existing terminal operations.

*Source: Decomposition Section 2 (OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity)*

**Reinstatement Timing:**
- **ASSUMPTION**: Site reinstatement occurs progressively during construction completion and intensifies during pre-handover phase
- **ASSUMPTION**: Final site reinstatement complete before handover (handover acceptance criterion)

## Construction

**Site Reinstatement Record Deliverables:**

Per _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts:
- **Site clearance records**: Checklists and inspection forms documenting removal of temporary facilities and site cleanup
- **Reinstatement photographs**: Before/during/after photographic evidence of site condition

*Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts)*

**ASSUMPTION: Site clearance records shall include:**

**1. Temporary Facilities Removal Records**
- Site offices, trailers, welfare facilities — removal confirmation, disposal/return records
- Laydown areas and material storage — clearance confirmation, ground surface restoration
- Construction access roads (temporary) — removal or acceptance as permanent
- Temporary utilities (power, water, sewer connections) — disconnection confirmation, service termination records
- Construction fencing and barriers — removal confirmation
- Signage (construction signage) — removal confirmation

**2. Site Cleanup Records**
- Construction debris removal — waste manifests, disposal facility receipts
- Scrap material removal — recycling or disposal records
- Surplus materials disposition — return to suppliers, storage, or disposal records
- Hazardous waste removal (if any) — manifests, disposal certificates
- Site cleaning (sweeping, washing) — inspection records

**3. Ground Surface Restoration Records**
- Temporary excavations — backfill, compaction test records
- Disturbed paving areas — reinstatement inspection, compaction/materials compliance
- Landscaping restoration — planting records, topsoil placement, seeding
- Drainage restoration — inspection of restored drainage systems
- Erosion control removal (after stabilization) — confirmation that permanent erosion controls in place

**4. Environmental Compliance Records**
- Contaminated soil remediation (if required) — soil test results, disposal/treatment records
- Stormwater management — final inspection of permanent systems
- Spill remediation (if any spills occurred during construction) — cleanup verification
- Environmental site assessment (if required at closeout) — report

**5. Safety Hazard Elimination Records**
- Excavations backfilled and stabilized — inspection confirmation
- Temporary barriers and safety fencing removed — inspection confirmation
- Underground obstructions marked or removed — as-built verification
- Access controls and site security transitioned to Employer

**Reinstatement Photographs:**
- Before construction (baseline photos)
- During construction (showing temporary facilities in use)
- During reinstatement activities (removal and restoration in progress)
- After reinstatement (final condition for handover)
- Organized by area and date

*Source: **ASSUMPTION** — typical site reinstatement record content*

**Inspection and Acceptance:**
- **ASSUMPTION**: Contractor QA/QC inspects site reinstatement
- **ASSUMPTION**: Employer (or Employer's representative) inspects and accepts final site condition
- **ASSUMPTION**: Site reinstatement acceptance is handover acceptance criterion (cross-reference DEL-35.03)
