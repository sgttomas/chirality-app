# Procedure: DEL-35.04 Site Reinstatement Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Process for documenting site reinstatement — removal of temporary construction facilities and site restoration prior to handover.

*Source: _CONTEXT.md*

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies**: Construction substantially complete (can remove facilities only when no longer needed)

**Reference Materials**: Employer's Requirements (site condition requirements), Design & Build Contract (site reinstatement clauses), PKG-00 deliverables (temporary facilities to be removed)

**Personnel**: Construction manager, QA/QC inspector, environmental specialist (if remediation required), Employer representative (for acceptance inspection)

## Steps

**Phase 1: Planning (Late Construction)**
1. Review contract requirements for site reinstatement
2. Develop site clearance checklist (temporary facilities to be removed)
3. Take baseline "before construction" photographs (if not already done during mobilization)
4. Identify any environmental remediation needs
5. Plan reinstatement schedule (coordinate with construction completion)

**Phase 2: Progressive Reinstatement (During Construction Completion)**
1. Remove temporary facilities as soon as no longer needed (progressive approach)
2. Photograph facilities before removal and area after removal
3. Document disposal (waste manifests for debris, return records for rental equipment)
4. Backfill temporary excavations, restore temporary access roads (if not permanent)
5. Maintain site clearance checklist (mark items complete as removed)

**Phase 3: Final Site Cleanup (Pre-Handover)**
1. Remove all remaining temporary facilities (site offices, fencing, signage)
2. Final site cleanup (sweep, wash, remove all construction debris)
3. Restore disturbed landscaping (topsoil, seeding, planting)
4. Restore disturbed paving/drainage (if any)
5. Remove erosion controls (after permanent controls in place and site stabilized)
6. Take "after reinstatement" photographs (comprehensive site coverage)

**Phase 4: Environmental Compliance (Pre-Handover)**
1. Conduct environmental assessment if contamination suspected
2. Remediate contaminated soil/groundwater if required (document remediation)
3. Final stormwater system inspection
4. Compile waste manifests and disposal records
5. Document environmental compliance

**Phase 5: Inspection and Acceptance (Pre-Handover)**
1. Contractor QA/QC inspection (verify site clearance checklist 100% complete)
2. Compile site reinstatement records package (checklists, photographs, waste records)
3. Request Employer inspection
4. Employer representative inspects site (walk-through with checklist)
5. Address any deficiencies identified by Employer
6. Obtain Employer acceptance sign-off on site clearance checklist
7. Include site reinstatement records in handover package (DEL-35.03)

## Verification

**VM-01**: All temporary facilities removed (checklist 100% complete)
**VM-02**: Photographic evidence (before/after comparison demonstrates reinstatement)
**VM-03**: Employer inspection and acceptance (sign-off on checklist)
**VM-04**: Environmental compliance (waste manifests, remediation records if applicable)

## Records

**Outputs**: Site clearance checklists, reinstatement photographs (organized by area/date), inspection reports, waste disposal manifests, environmental records (if applicable), Employer acceptance sign-off

**Management**: Records included in handover package (DEL-35.03), retention per project requirements, Contractor archive copies retained for warranty period
