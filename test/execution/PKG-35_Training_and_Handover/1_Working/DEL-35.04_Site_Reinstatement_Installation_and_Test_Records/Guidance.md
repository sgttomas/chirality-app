# Guidance: DEL-35.04 Site Reinstatement Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Site reinstatement records document removal of temporary construction facilities and site restoration, demonstrating site is ready for handover in acceptable condition (cross-reference DEL-35.03).

## Principles

**Principle 1: Terminal Continuity (OBJ-5)**
Site reinstatement supports **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity** by coordinating removal of construction facilities to minimize disruption to existing Fraser Surrey Terminal operations.

**Principle 2: Environmental Protection (OBJ-7)**
Site reinstatement demonstrates **OBJ-7: Environmental Protection** through proper waste disposal, contamination remediation (if required), and site restoration.

**Principle 3: Handover Acceptance Criterion**
Site reinstatement completion is typically a handover acceptance criterion — site must be clean, safe, and restored before Employer accepts facility.

*Source: **ASSUMPTION** — typical handover requirement; cross-reference DEL-35.03*

## Considerations

**Consideration 1: Progressive vs. Final Reinstatement**
Reinstatement can occur progressively (remove facilities as soon as no longer needed) or as final cleanup before handover. Progressive approach reduces final cleanup intensity but requires coordination with ongoing construction.

**Consideration 2: Temporary vs. Permanent Facilities**
Some "temporary" facilities may become permanent (e.g., access roads incorporated into facility). Clarify with Employer what becomes permanent vs. what must be removed.

**Consideration 3: Environmental Contamination Risk**
Construction activities may cause soil/groundwater contamination (fuel spills, hazardous materials). Conduct environmental assessment if contamination suspected; remediate before handover.

**Consideration 4: Waste Disposal Documentation**
Maintain waste manifests for all waste disposal (especially hazardous waste) — regulatory requirement and demonstrates environmental compliance.

**Consideration 5: Photographic Evidence Value**
Before/after photographs are powerful evidence for reinstatement acceptance and protect against future claims about site condition.

## Trade-offs

**Trade-off 1: Reinstatement Timing vs. Construction Flexibility**
Early reinstatement reduces final cleanup burden but may eliminate access/staging areas still useful for late construction activities. Balance cleanup timing with construction needs.

**Trade-off 2: Restoration Quality vs. Cost**
Site can be restored to "better than before" (upgrade landscaping, paving) or "same as before" (minimum restoration). Balance enhancement opportunities vs. cost and schedule.
