## Conditions

**Handover Context:**

Handover documentation formalizes the transfer of the canola oil transload facility from D&B Contractor to Employer, certifying that:
- Facility is complete per contract requirements
- Facility is safe for operations
- All systems have been commissioned and tested
- Operations team is trained and competent (cross-reference DEL-35.01, DEL-35.02)
- All project documentation has been delivered
- Facility is ready for commercial operations

**Facility Capacity**: 1,000,000 MT per annum throughput, 45,000 MT storage

*Source: Decomposition Section 1.1 (Project Overview)*

**Handover Timing:**
- **ASSUMPTION**: Handover occurs after successful commissioning, performance testing, and operations team training
- **ASSUMPTION**: Handover typically coincides with "Taking Over" certificate issuance per contract terms
- **ASSUMPTION**: May be phased handover (by system or area) or single handover event depending on contract

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **TBD** — Specific handover acceptance criteria per Employer's Requirements and contract
- **ASSUMPTION**: Typically includes mechanical completion, successful commissioning, performance test acceptance, training completion, safety verification, documentation completeness, acceptable outstanding defects list

## Construction

**Handover Documentation Deliverables:**

Per _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts:
- **Taking Over certificates**: Formal certificate(s) signed by Employer accepting facility

**3. Deliverable Documentation Index**
- Master document index (all project deliverables)
- Design documentation index
- Operating documentation index
- Record documentation index

**4. Cross-References to Other Deliverables**
- Training materials (DEL-35.01) and records (DEL-35.02)
- Operating and maintenance documentation (PKG-27, PKG-31)
