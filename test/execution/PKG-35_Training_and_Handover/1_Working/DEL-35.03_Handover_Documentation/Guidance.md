# Guidance: DEL-35.03 Handover Documentation

## Purpose

Handover documentation formalizes facility transfer from D&B Contractor to Employer, certifying completion, commissioning success, trained operations team, documentation delivery, and operational readiness for the canola oil transload facility (1,000,000 MT/annum, 45,000 MT storage).

*Source: _CONTEXT.md, Decomposition Section 1.1*

## Principles

**Principle 1: Contractual Completion Milestone**
Handover marks substantial completion per Design & Build contract terms, triggering payment milestones, warranty commencement, and operational responsibility transfer.

**Principle 2: Operational Readiness Certification**
Handover certifies facility is safe and ready for commercial operations, supporting **OBJ-1: Safe & Reliable Operation**.

**Principle 3: Lifecycle Cost Optimization (OBJ-9)**
Comprehensive handover documentation supports **OBJ-9: Lifecycle Cost Optimization** by providing complete documentation and trained workforce, minimizing post-handover support costs and operational risks.

*Source: Decomposition Section 2 (OBJ-9), Section 6 (DEL-35.01-35.05 support OBJ-9)*

**Principle 4: Terminal Continuity (OBJ-5)**
Handover process considers **OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity** — minimizing disruption to existing Fraser Surrey Terminal operations during transition.

## Considerations

**Consideration 1: Handover Acceptance Criteria**
Critical to agree handover acceptance criteria early in project:
- Define "substantial completion" per contract
- Establish performance test acceptance criteria
- Agree acceptable outstanding defects (punch list criteria)
- Define training completion requirements (cross-reference DEL-35.02)
- Clarify documentation delivery requirements

**Consideration 2: Phased vs. Single Handover**
Large facilities may use phased handover (by system or area) to enable early partial operations. Consider schedule benefits vs. coordination complexity.

**Consideration 3: Integration with All Deliverables**
Handover depends on completion of essentially all project deliverables across all packages — early coordination critical to avoid handover delays.

**Consideration 4: Trained Operations Team Readiness**
Training completion (DEL-35.01, DEL-35.02) is often handover acceptance criterion — coordinate training schedule with handover target date.

*Cross-reference DEL-35.01 Training Materials, DEL-35.02 Training Records*

**Consideration 5: Outstanding Defects Management**
Outstanding defects (punch list) acceptable for handover if:
- Do not prevent safe operation
- Documented with completion plan
- Employer acknowledges acceptance
- Defects liability process established (cross-reference DEL-35.05)

*Cross-reference DEL-35.05 Defects Liability*

## Trade-offs

**Trade-off 1: Handover Timing vs. Completion Quality**
Early handover enables Employer revenue generation but may accept more outstanding defects. Balance schedule pressure vs. completion quality.

**Trade-off 2: Documentation Completeness vs. Handover Schedule**
Waiting for perfect as-built documentation delays handover. Accept preliminary as-built with update commitment, or delay handover for complete documentation.

**Trade-off 3: Formal Ceremony vs. Practical Transfer**
Formal handover ceremony provides project closure and stakeholder recognition, but adds schedule complexity. Balance formality with practical project needs.

## Examples

**Example 1: Taking Over Certificate Structure**
```
TAKING OVER CERTIFICATE

Project: Canola Oil Transload Facility — Phase 1
Contract No: [contract reference]
Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, Surrey, BC

This certifies that the Contractor [name] has achieved Substantial Completion
of the Works per Contract dated [contract date].

Works Description: [facility scope summary]
Taking Over Date: [date]

The Employer [name] hereby takes over the Works subject to:
- Outstanding defects listed in attached Defects List dated [date]
- Defects liability period of [period] commencing [date]

Contractor Representative: _________________ Date: _______
Employer Representative: _________________ Date: _______
Witness: _________________ Date: _______
```

**Example 2: Master Handover Checklist Structure**
| Item | Requirement | Status | Date | Contractor Sign | Employer Accept |
|------|-------------|--------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Mechanical completion | Complete | [date] | [signature] | [signature] |
| 2 | Commissioning complete | Complete | [date] | [signature] | [signature] |
| 3 | Performance tests passed | Complete | [date] | [signature] | [signature] |
| 4 | Training complete (DEL-35.02) | Complete | [date] | [signature] | [signature] |
| ... |
