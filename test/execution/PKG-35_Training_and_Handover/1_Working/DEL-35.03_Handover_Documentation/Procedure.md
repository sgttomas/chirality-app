- Performance tests passed
- Training complete (DEL-35.01, DEL-35.02)
- Safety systems verified
- Documentation delivered (all packages)
- Regulatory approvals obtained
- Site reinstatement complete (DEL-35.04)

*Cross-references: DEL-35.01, DEL-35.02, DEL-35.04*

**Reference Materials:**
- Design & Build Contract — handover clauses, acceptance criteria

## Steps

**Phase 1: Handover Planning (Early Project)**
1. Review contract handover requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Develop handover checklist templates (master, system, documentation, training, safety)
3. Establish handover acceptance criteria with Employer
4. Plan handover schedule (coordinate with commissioning and training)

**Phase 2: Pre-Handover Preparation (Late Commissioning)**
1. Complete system commissioning and testing
2. Complete operations team training (DEL-35.01, DEL-35.02)
3. Compile documentation package (all deliverables, document index)
4. Complete site reinstatement (DEL-35.04)
5. Prepare handover checklists (populate with completion evidence)

**Phase 3: Handover Readiness Review (Pre-Handover)**
1. Internal Contractor review of handover readiness
2. Complete all handover checklists with supporting evidence
3. Prepare outstanding defects list (punch list) if applicable
4. Submit handover package to Employer for review
5. Resolve Employer comments or document as punch list items

**Phase 4: Handover Execution (Handover Event)**
1. Conduct handover briefing with Employer (facility status, systems review, operations team intro)
2. Walk through handover checklists with Employer (obtain sign-offs)
3. Review and agree outstanding defects list (establish defects liability process per DEL-35.05)
4. Execute Taking Over Certificate (authorized representatives sign)
5. Transfer documentation package to Employer
6. Conduct handover ceremony (optional — stakeholder recognition)

**Phase 5: Post-Handover Transition (Immediate Post-Handover)**
1. Transfer facility keys, access controls, system passwords to Employer
2. Brief Employer operations team on facility status and outstanding items
3. Establish defects liability communication protocol (DEL-35.05)
4. Archive Contractor copies of handover documentation
5. Celebrate project completion with team
