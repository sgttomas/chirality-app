## Trade-offs

**Design Trade-offs to Evaluate:**

| Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Considerations | Specification Link | Recommended Approach | Decision Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Header routing | **Direct routing:** Shortest pipe run from stations to discharge point (lower cost, less material, less pressure drop, simpler installation) | **Routed for access:** Longer pipe run with routing to maintain access corridors (higher cost, more material, slightly higher pressure drop, better maintenance access, more operational flexibility) | OBJ-1 (safe operation, maintenance access) vs. cost; operational flexibility (OBJ-4) vs. initial capital; long-term maintenance cost vs. initial cost | FN-04 (header routing), PF-04 (header performance) | **PROPOSAL:** Balance direct routing with access requirements; provide access at key points (isolation valves, branch connections, high points with air release valves); avoid extreme routing but ensure maintenance accessibility; verify pressure drop acceptable with DEL-10.03 hydraulic analysis | **TBD** — human ruling required; document in design review minutes |
| Containment approach | **Individual pans per station:** 32 separate containment pans, one under each station (simpler isolation during maintenance, higher material cost, more sump pumps potentially, better failure mode — single pan failure affects one station only) | **Common containment trench:** Single continuous containment system under all stations (lower material cost, fewer sump pumps, more complex drainage design with longer drain runs, larger single sump, single-point failure affects all stations) | Cost (material, installation, pumps) vs. maintenance (isolation, failure modes) vs. regulatory compliance (containment volume requirements); operational impact of pan failure (one station vs. all stations); drainage design complexity | FN-05 (containment shown), PF-03 (containment volume requirements) | **PROPOSAL:** Individual pans for operational flexibility and isolation (aligns with OBJ-1 safe operation and OBJ-4 operational flexibility); simplifies compliance (each pan sized for one railcar); better failure mode (localized impact); **TBD** — verify regulatory requirements allow individual pans (some jurisdictions may require common secondary containment); cost analysis to compare total installed cost | **TBD** — human ruling required after cost analysis and regulatory review; document decision with rationale |
| Drawing detail level | **Minimum for construction:** Provide minimum detail required for construction (faster production, less detail, lower engineering cost, requires more field decisions and RFIs) | **Additional detail for operations/maintenance:** Provide comprehensive detail including operational information (slower production, more complete, higher engineering cost, reduces field questions and RFIs, better long-term value for operations/maintenance) | Schedule (faster issue) vs. long-term value (fewer RFIs, better operations documentation); construction needs (build to this) vs. operations/maintenance needs (operate and maintain using this); project stage (early drawings vs. IFC drawings) | QA-01 (appropriate detail level) | **PROPOSAL:** Provide sufficient detail for construction (dimensions, locations, connections clear); supplement with vendor details (DEL-10.04 provides equipment details); focus drawing set on contractor-installed scope (Specification.md §Scope exclusions); align detail level with project stage gate requirements (30% less detail, IFC more detail); **TBD** — confirm detail level expectation with Employer and project stage gate requirements | **TBD** — align with project stage gate requirements; may vary by issue stage (30% / 60% / 90% / IFC) |
| Standard vs. custom arms | **Standard catalog unloading arms:** Use vendor standard products (lower cost, faster delivery, proven design, vendor support, limited optimization for site-specific conditions) | **Custom-designed arms:** Design custom arms for specific application (higher cost, longer delivery lead time, optimized for specific site constraints and performance, potential performance benefits, less vendor support) | Cost (standard lower) vs. optimization (custom better); delivery schedule (standard faster) vs. performance (custom potentially better); vendor support (standard better) vs. custom engineering; site constraints (track curvature, clearances — may require custom if severe) | FN-03 (arm positions); DEL-10.04 (arm data sheets) | **PROPOSAL:** Standard catalog arms unless specific site constraints require custom (e.g., severe track curvature, unusual clearances, non-standard railcar interface); verify vendor standard arms can accommodate site conditions (track geometry per PKG-07, clearances); **TBD** — confirm with equipment vendor survey and DEL-10.03 analysis (reach envelope, positioning tolerance); decision impacts DEL-10.04 (standard data sheets vs. custom design) | **TBD** — human ruling required after vendor survey and site constraint analysis; document decision with rationale |
| Unloading arm type | **Top-loading arms:** Connect to railcar top outlet (lower cost, simpler, requires railcar top access via platform, slower unloading, more vapor release to atmosphere) | **Bottom-loading arms:** Connect to railcar bottom outlet (higher cost, more complex arm design with swivel joints, faster unloading via gravity, less vapor release, no top access required, safer operations) | Cost (top-loading lower) vs. operational efficiency (bottom-loading faster); safety (vapor management — bottom-loading better) vs. capital cost; unloading speed (bottom-loading faster for gravity unloading) vs. complexity; industry practice (bottom-loading typical for liquid bulk terminals) | FN-03 (arm arrangement); OBJ-1 (safe operation), OBJ-2 (throughput capacity) | **ASSUMPTION:** Bottom-loading arms typical for edible oil transload terminals (industry standard practice; faster unloading via gravity; better vapor management; aligns with OBJ-1 and OBJ-2); **TBD** — confirm with ER requirements (may specify arm type); verify railcar fleet compatibility (most modern tank cars have bottom outlets, but confirm with expected railcar types) | **ASSUMPTION** — bottom-loading; **TBD** — verify with ER and railcar fleet data |

**ASSUMPTION:** All trade-off decisions to be documented in design rationale records, design review minutes, or basis of design document. Human ruling required for final selection of design options. Decisions impact multiple deliverables (drawings, calculations DEL-10.03, data sheets DEL-10.04, specifications DEL-10.02).

**Schedule vs. Quality Trade-offs:**

| Consideration | Issue | Recommendation | Procedure Link | Specification Link |
|---------------|-------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Early GA issue for coordination | Issue GA early (30% design stage) for civil/structural coordination (PKG-05) and rail interface coordination (PKG-07) vs. waiting for detailed design completion (90% or IFC) | **Recommended:** Phased issue approach: (1) GA at 30% for early coordination (may have TBDs and assumptions clearly marked), (2) detailed drawings (arrangements, header layout, containment details) at 60–90% for construction, (3) IFC issue with all details finalized; allows early coordination while maintaining design flexibility | Procedure.md Step 6 (issue process); **TBD** — project stage gate requirements and phased issue plan | Specification.md §Documentation (may have multiple issues at different design stages) |
| IDC timing | Conduct IDC early (30–50% design stage — more design changes expected but more time to resolve conflicts) vs. late IDC (70–90% design stage — fewer design changes but less time to resolve conflicts, higher cost of changes if major conflicts found) | **Recommended:** Conduct IDC at appropriate design stage (50–60% typical) to balance design flexibility and conflict resolution time; allows changes without major rework but sufficient design maturity for meaningful coordination; may require multiple IDC sessions at different stages (early IDC for major interfaces, later IDC for detail confirmation) | Procedure.md Step 4 (IDC process and timing) | Specification.md IF-01 through IF-06 (all interface requirements require IDC coordination) |
| Revision management | Frequent revisions (more current information but more document control overhead and potential for confusion) vs. infrequent revisions (less overhead but information may be out of date for longer periods) | **Recommended:** Align revisions with project milestones and freeze points (e.g., 30% freeze, 60% freeze, 90% freeze, IFC); issue formal revisions at these milestones; use informal mark-ups or RFIs for minor changes between milestones; reduces overhead while providing controlled updates at key decision points | Procedure.md Step 6 (revision management); **TBD** — project stage gate plan and freeze point schedule | Specification.md QA-02 (revision control); Datasheet.md §Attributes (revision control **TBD**) |

   - **Purpose:** Provides detail for arm installation; defines clearances for construction and operations; shows railcar interface

3. **Header Pipe Layout**
   - **Content:** Gravity flow header routing (plan and profile views showing elevations), pipe sizes (per DEL-10.03 calculations — note pipe sizes on drawing), slopes (minimum 1:100 — mark slopes with arrows and slope values), branch connections from each of 32 stations (connection details), isolation valves (show valve locations, types, operators — manual vs. actuated), air release valves (at high points for venting), pipe supports (support locations — interface with PKG-05/PKG-06), discharge connection to PKG-14 piping (connection size, elevation, location)
   - **Typical scale:** 1:50 or 1:100 (system overview with sufficient detail for pipe routing and connections)
   - **Key interfaces:** PKG-14 (discharge connection — coordinate size, location, elevation), PKG-05 (pipe supports — support locations and loads), PKG-06 (structural supports for overhead piping if applicable)
   - **Purpose:** Defines piping system for installation; shows gravity flow design (slopes); provides basis for piping material takeoff and installation

4. **Containment Details**
   - **Content:** Spill containment pans (32 individual per PROPOSAL or combined system per trade-off decision — show pan arrangement, dimensions), collection sumps (sump locations, dimensions, volume), drain routing (from pans to sumps — pipe sizes, slopes), sump pump locations (pump type, capacity, mounting), sump sizing (volume calculations or reference to DEL-10.03), containment volume calculations reference (note volume and reference to DEL-10.03), level switches (sump level instrumentation — interface PKG-20), electrical connections for pumps (power supply locations — interface PKG-17)
   - **Typical scale:** 1:20 or 1:50 (sufficient detail for containment construction and drainage connections)
   - **Key interfaces:** PKG-05 (containment structure — support for pans if required), PKG-17 (pump power — electrical connections), PKG-20 (level switches — instrument connections)
   - **Purpose:** Defines containment system for environmental protection; demonstrates regulatory compliance; provides detail for containment construction

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| — | No conflicts identified at this stage | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:**
- `_REFERENCES.md` is not yet populated with specific Employer's Requirements clauses. Conflicts may emerge when ER content is reviewed during detailed design (Procedure.md Step 2). Update this table as needed during WORKING_ITEMS sessions.
- Trade-offs identified in §Trade-offs above require human ruling for final selection. Document decisions in design review minutes, basis of design, or trade-off analysis report. Decisions impact multiple deliverables.
- Interface coordination conflicts (if any) to be resolved through IDC process per Procedure.md Step 4. Unresolved conflicts to be escalated to project management with recommendation.
- Cross-document consistency conflicts: none identified in Pass 2 and Pass 3 reviews. All cross-references verified.

**Cross-Document Consistency Check (Pass 3 — Final Verification):**

| Check | Status | Verification Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Datasheet entities appear in Specification requirements | ✓ Verified | All 7 PKG-10 scope elements from Datasheet.md §Conditions are explicitly addressed in Specification.md FN-01 through FN-05 |
| Specification requirements have rationale in Guidance | ✓ Verified | All requirement categories (FN/PF/IF/QA) have corresponding principles, considerations, and rationale in this document with bidirectional cross-references |
| Specification requirements have verification in Procedure | ✓ Verified | Verification matrix in Specification.md aligns with Procedure.md steps; all requirements traceable to procedure steps |
| Terminology consistent across documents | ✓ Verified | Consistent use across all 4 documents: "unloading arms" (not "loading arms" or "transfer arms"), "quick-connects" (not "couplers" alone), "gravity flow header" (not just "header"), "spill containment" (not "secondary containment" inconsistently), "collection system", "atmospheric venting", "flow indicators" |
| Values consistent across documents | ✓ Verified | Key values consistent: 32 stations, 1,000,000 MT/annum throughput, minimum 1:100 header slope, 4 anticipated drawing types, all scope elements (7 items) |
| Interface elements consistent | ✓ Verified | Interface requirements IF-01 through IF-06 in Specification.md align with Datasheet.md §Construction interface table, Procedure.md Step 4 IDC process, and this document §Interface Considerations |
| Anticipated artifacts consistent | ✓ Verified | Drawing list consistent across all documents: (1) GA, (2) Arm Arrangement, (3) Header Layout, (4) Containment Details — same sequence and naming in Datasheet.md §Construction, Specification.md §Documentation, Procedure.md Step 1, and this document §Examples |
| Procedure prerequisites match Specification requirements | ✓ Verified | Procedure.md §Prerequisites lists upstream inputs that align with Specification.md requirements (DEL-10.02 for design basis, DEL-10.03 for calculations, DEL-10.04 for equipment data, PKG-07 for track alignment, etc.) |
| Objective alignment consistent | ✓ Verified | All 4 project objectives (OBJ-1, OBJ-2, OBJ-4, OBJ-7) consistently referenced across Datasheet.md §References, Specification.md requirements (FN, PF), and this document §Principles with consistent interpretation |
| TBD and ASSUMPTION labels consistent | ✓ Verified | All TBDs and ASSUMPTIONs consistently marked across documents; same items marked TBD in all documents (ER clauses, CAD standard, design life, etc.) |
