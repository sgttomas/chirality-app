# Guidance: DEL-10.02 Railcar Unloading Technical Specification

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of the **Railcar Unloading Technical Specification** for **PKG-10 Railcar Unloading System**.

The Technical Specification defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for the railcar unloading system, enabling safe and reliable transfer of canola oil from railcars (32 stations) to the gravity flow header and downstream storage. This specification serves as the technical requirements basis for equipment procurement, fabrication, installation, and testing, and drives the content of related deliverables (DEL-10.01 drawings, DEL-10.03 calculations, DEL-10.04 data sheets, DEL-10.05 installation/test records). (**Source:** Decomposition §5 PKG-10; Datasheet.md §Conditions; Specification.md §Scope)

**Deliverable Classification:**
- **Type:** Specification (Technical Specification for Equipment & Systems)
- **Discipline:** Process
- **Responsible:** D&B Contractor
- **Status:** INITIALIZED

**Downstream Use:**
- **Procurement team** uses specification for equipment procurement (unloading arms, pumps, valves, instruments — technical requirements for bid packages and purchase orders)
- **Vendors/manufacturers** use specification to design, fabricate, and test equipment meeting project requirements
- **Construction contractors** use specification for installation standards (welding, surface preparation, testing, quality control)
- **QA/QC inspectors** use specification for inspection and testing criteria (acceptance criteria, test requirements, documentation requirements)
- **Design team** uses specification as basis for detailed design (DEL-10.01 drawings show equipment per specification; DEL-10.03 calculations verify performance per specification; DEL-10.04 data sheets implement specification for specific equipment)
- **Commissioning team** uses specification for pre-commissioning requirements (cleaning, testing, functional verification)
- **Operations and maintenance teams** use specification for understanding equipment capabilities and maintenance requirements

**Engineering Design Principles (Technical Specification Development):**

| Principle | Application | Specification Link | Rationale | Procedure Link |

## Trade-offs

**Design Trade-offs to Evaluate (Require Human Ruling):**

| Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Considerations | Specification Link | Recommended Approach | Decision Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|

Document decision with rationale including cost analysis, food-grade certification verification, and structural implications. | **TBD** — Awaiting human ruling; decision affects DEL-10.04 (data sheet specifications for arms), DEL-10.03 (structural loads for foundations), procurement (equipment cost and vendor selection) |
| **Header piping material** | **Carbon steel ASTM A53 Grade B with internal coating or lining:** Lower material cost (significant savings for large diameter/long run piping), readily available (standard pipe sizes in stock), acceptable for canola oil service if properly coated/lined (coating prevents corrosion and provides smooth surface), requires coating maintenance (periodic inspection, recoating if coating degrades — lifecycle cost consideration), field welding easier (standard welding procedures for carbon steel) | **Stainless steel SS304 or SS316:** Higher material cost (major cost impact for large diameter/long run piping), excellent corrosion resistance (no coating required), food-grade without coating (widely accepted for food contact), lower long-term maintenance (no coating to maintain), better for food service (industry preference for edible oils), field welding more complex (requires qualified welders and procedures for stainless) | **Cost vs. performance vs. lifecycle:** Carbon steel lower initial cost but requires coating maintenance (inspect, recoat periodically — lifecycle cost); stainless higher initial cost but lower maintenance (no coating) — lifecycle cost may favor stainless depending on design life and maintenance cost. **Food-grade considerations:** Stainless preferred for food-grade service (no coating to degrade or contaminate product); carbon steel acceptable if coating food-grade and properly maintained. **Corrosion:** Stainless superior corrosion resistance (no coating failure risk); carbon steel adequate if coating maintained. **OBJ-9 (lifecycle cost if applicable):** Initial cost (carbon steel lower) vs. lifecycle cost (stainless potentially lower due to maintenance savings). **TBD** — Perform lifecycle cost analysis comparing initial cost + coating maintenance cost over design life; confirm Employer preference for food-grade piping materials; consider industry practice for similar facilities. | Specification.md MT-02 (pipe materials per code — carbon steel or stainless steel acceptable; select based on lifecycle cost analysis and food-grade considerations) | **PROPOSAL:** Stainless steel SS304 or SS316 for header piping (preferred for food-grade service, long-term durability, lower maintenance, and industry practice for edible oil facilities); carbon steel with food-grade coating acceptable alternative if lifecycle cost analysis demonstrates significant savings and Employer accepts coated carbon steel for food contact. **TBD** — Human ruling required after lifecycle cost analysis (compare initial material cost + installation cost + maintenance cost over design life **TBD** — typically 25–30 years), Employer preference confirmation for food-grade piping (some food facilities require stainless for all product contact piping), and review of industry practice for similar edible oil terminals. Document decision with rationale including lifecycle cost analysis, food-grade compliance, and maintenance considerations. | **TBD** — Awaiting human ruling; decision has major cost impact (material cost, installation cost, maintenance cost); affects DEL-10.01 (header pipe specification on drawings), DEL-10.03 (cost estimate), procurement (piping material procurement) |
| **Containment pan material** | **Coated carbon steel (epoxy or polyurethane coating for corrosion protection):** Lower material cost (carbon steel less expensive than stainless), adequate structural capacity (carbon steel suitable for containment loads), requires coating for corrosion protection (outdoor exposure, product spills, cleaning chemicals), coating maintenance required (inspect coating, repair/recoat as needed — lifecycle cost), cleanability depends on coating condition (smooth coating when new; may degrade over time requiring maintenance) | **Stainless steel SS304 (no coating required):** Higher material cost (stainless significantly more expensive than coated carbon steel for large containment pans), excellent corrosion resistance (no coating required for outdoor exposure or product spills), no coating maintenance (eliminates coating inspection/repair/recoat — lifecycle cost benefit), easier cleaning (stainless smooth surface; no coating to degrade), better long-term durability (no coating failure risk) | **Cost vs. maintenance vs. cleanability:** Coated carbon steel lower initial cost but requires coating maintenance (inspect, repair, recoat — lifecycle cost and maintenance effort); stainless higher initial cost but eliminates coating maintenance (lifecycle cost may favor stainless depending on design life and coating maintenance frequency). **Environmental protection (OBJ-7):** Both materials adequate if properly maintained; stainless has no coating failure risk (eliminates one potential failure mode). **Cleanability:** Stainless easier to clean (smooth surface, no coating degradation); coated steel adequate if coating maintained. **OBJ-9 (lifecycle cost if applicable):** Initial cost (coated steel lower) vs. lifecycle cost (stainless potentially lower if coating maintenance avoided). **TBD** — Perform lifecycle cost analysis; consider maintenance effort and cleanability; confirm Employer preference. | Specification.md MT-03 (containment materials — coated carbon steel or stainless steel per corrosion resistance and cleanability requirements) | **PROPOSAL:** Coated carbon steel (epoxy or polyurethane coating) for containment pans (acceptable for environmental protection and corrosion resistance with proper coating; lower initial cost; coating maintenance manageable with routine inspection/repair program); stainless steel SS304 preferred alternative if lifecycle cost analysis supports or if Employer prefers stainless for easier cleaning and lower maintenance. **TBD** — Human ruling required after lifecycle cost analysis (compare initial material cost + coating cost + maintenance cost over design life), maintenance program assessment (coating inspection/repair feasibility and cost), cleanability requirements confirmation (frequency of cleaning, ease of cleaning importance), and Employer preference. Document decision with rationale including cost analysis, maintenance plan, and cleanability considerations. | **TBD** — Awaiting human ruling; decision affects containment system cost (material cost, coating cost, maintenance cost); affects DEL-10.01 (containment details specification on drawings), DEL-10.03 (cost estimate) |
| **Specification detail level (performance-based vs. prescriptive)** | **Performance-based specification:** Specifies required outcomes (flow rate, pressure rating, temperature range, operational envelope) without prescribing specific designs or methods; allows vendors to propose optimal solutions (proven designs, cost-effective approaches, innovative solutions); requires clear performance criteria and acceptance criteria (must be verifiable); procurement flexibility (multiple vendors can propose different solutions meeting performance requirements); quality control through performance verification (testing, demonstration) | **Prescriptive specification:** Specifies exact designs, materials, methods, and procedures; less vendor flexibility (specific products or approaches required); tighter quality control (specific requirements easier to inspect and verify); may eliminate vendor innovation (optimal solutions may not be considered); may increase cost (limits competition, may specify non-optimal approaches) | **Flexibility vs. control:** Performance-based allows vendor innovation and optimization (may reduce cost, improve performance); prescriptive provides tighter control (easier to verify compliance, less risk of non-conforming proposals). **Procurement:** Performance-based encourages competition (more vendors can propose); prescriptive may limit competition (fewer vendors meet specific requirements). **Risk:** Performance-based requires robust acceptance criteria and verification (performance testing, demonstration); prescriptive easier to verify (inspect against specific requirements). **Industry practice:** Performance-based typical for equipment procurement (proven vendor designs); prescriptive typical for safety-critical items or where specific approach required by code/regulation. **Recommendation:** Mix of performance-based and prescriptive: performance-based for equipment (arms, pumps — allow vendor optimization); prescriptive where required by code (welding per ASME B31.3, materials per code) or where specific approach required (food-grade requirements, containment volume per regulatory). | Specification.md (all requirements); Guidance.md §Principles (performance-based requirements principle) | **RECOMMENDED:** Primarily performance-based specification with prescriptive requirements where required by code, regulation, or Employer requirements: Performance-based for equipment (unloading arms, pumps, instruments — specify required performance, allow vendor to propose optimal design meeting performance); Prescriptive for code-required items (welding per ASME B31.3, materials per code, testing per code); Prescriptive for food-grade requirements (food-grade materials and finishes per industry standards or ER); Prescriptive for containment volume (per regulatory requirements and DEL-10.03 calculations). This approach balances vendor flexibility and innovation with quality control and compliance. Clear acceptance criteria and verification methods required for all performance-based requirements (specify how compliance will be verified — calculation, testing, demonstration). | **RECOMMENDED** — This is standard industry practice and aligns with Guidance.md §Principles; implement unless Employer prefers more prescriptive approach. Document specification approach in specification introduction and compliance matrix. |

**ASSUMPTION:** All trade-off decisions requiring human ruling to be documented in design rationale records, design review minutes, or basis of design document. Decisions affect multiple deliverables and have cost, schedule, and performance implications. Human ruling required for final selection; document rationale including technical analysis (lifecycle cost, performance, reliability), Employer preference, and industry practice.

**Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs (General Principles):**

| Consideration | Trade-off | Guidance |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Material selection | Higher-grade materials (e.g., stainless steel) increase initial cost but may reduce lifecycle maintenance cost (no coating, better corrosion resistance, longer life) | Perform lifecycle cost analysis comparing initial cost + maintenance cost over design life **TBD** (typically 25–30 years); consider OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization if applicable); recommend stainless for product contact (food-grade service) and coated carbon steel for non-product contact (lower cost acceptable where food-grade not required) |
| Workmanship standards | More stringent workmanship requirements (e.g., 100% radiography vs. spot radiography for welds; tighter surface finish tolerances; more comprehensive testing) increase construction cost but improve reliability and reduce risk of failures | Follow code-minimum requirements where adequate (codes provide acceptable safety and reliability); specify more stringent requirements only where justified by risk, criticality, or Employer requirements; avoid over-specification (unnecessary cost without commensurate benefit) |
| Equipment quality | Higher-quality equipment (e.g., premium brands, higher reliability ratings, longer warranties) increases initial cost but may reduce maintenance cost and downtime | Specify proven equipment designs from reputable vendors (balance cost and quality); avoid low-cost equipment with unproven reliability for critical applications (unloading arms, pumps — failures impact operations per OBJ-1, OBJ-2); consider vendor warranties and service support (longer warranties and better support reduce lifecycle cost) |
| Testing and verification | More comprehensive testing (e.g., functional testing of all equipment, 100% leak testing vs. sample testing, witnessed testing vs. certification) increases cost but provides greater assurance of compliance | Specify code-required testing (mandatory); specify additional testing for critical items (unloading arms, containment — critical for safety and environmental protection per OBJ-1, OBJ-7); risk-based approach (more testing for higher-risk items, less testing for lower-risk commodity items) |

**ASSUMPTION:** Optimize for OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization if applicable as project objective) where trade-offs involve initial cost vs. lifecycle cost. Document cost/performance trade-offs and obtain Employer input on cost/quality balance preferences.
