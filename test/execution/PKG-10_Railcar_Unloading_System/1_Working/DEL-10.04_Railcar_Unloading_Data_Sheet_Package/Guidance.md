## Principles

**Project Objective Alignment:**

This deliverable supports the following project objectives (per decomposition §6 Objective Mapping):

| Objective | ID | Relevance to DEL-10.04 | Specification Link | Data Sheet Requirement | Datasheet Link |
|-----------|-----|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Safe & Reliable Operation | OBJ-1 | Data sheets must specify equipment suitable for safe, reliable service (proven designs, code-compliant materials, adequate ratings, reliable seals, robust construction); equipment specifications ensure safe operations (adequate capacity margins, proper materials preventing failures, reliable quick-connects preventing spills) | Specification.md UA-01 through UA-06, SP-01 through SP-05 (all equipment content requirements ensure safe and reliable specifications) | Specify proven equipment designs (vendor standard products with track record preferred over custom designs unless justified); require code-compliant materials and construction; specify adequate safety margins in ratings (pressure/temperature ratings ≥ design conditions with margin) | Datasheet.md §Conditions (design conditions establish equipment rating requirements for safe operation) |
| Throughput Capacity (1,000,000 MT/annum) | OBJ-2 | Equipment capacity must support required throughput (arm flow rates per DEL-10.03 unloading rate calculations ensure throughput achievable; 32 arms with specified capacity achieve 1,000,000 MT/annum per DEL-10.03 verification) | Specification.md UA-02 (arm flow rate from DEL-10.03 throughput calculations); IF-02 (data sheet conditions align with DEL-10.03) | Specify arm flow rates meeting DEL-10.03 calculated requirements (flow capacity per station from throughput analysis); verify 32 arms with specified capacity support throughput per DEL-10.03 verification; coordinate equipment capacity with procurement (ensure purchased equipment meets or exceeds data sheet flow capacity) | Datasheet.md §Conditions (throughput capacity parameter drives equipment sizing — arm flow rates sized for throughput in DEL-10.03) |
| Operational Flexibility | OBJ-4 | Equipment specifications should enable flexible operations (arms operable individually — not hard-wired dependencies between stations; pump specifications support flexible containment operations; equipment suitable for partial system operations, maintenance isolation, varied operating scenarios) | Specification.md UA-02, SP-02 (equipment performance supports flexible operations) | Specify equipment for individual operation (each arm independently operable — not requiring all 32 stations operating simultaneously per DEL-10.03 flexible operations analysis); specify isolation provisions where applicable (valves, disconnects enabling equipment isolation for maintenance); avoid equipment dependencies limiting operational flexibility | Datasheet.md §Conditions (equipment designed for flexible operations per OBJ-4 — individual station operation capability) |
| Environmental Protection | OBJ-7 | Materials and containment equipment must protect environment (food-grade materials prevent product contamination — environmental concern for food products; containment pump specifications ensure spill recovery capability per DEL-10.03 containment design; leak-tight quick-connects prevent product release during operations) | Specification.md UA-03, SP-03 (materials requirements — food-grade compatible, environmentally suitable); SP-02 (pump capacity for spill recovery per DEL-10.03 containment calculations) | Specify food-grade compatible materials for all product contact (arms, couplers, pump wetted parts if pumping product — prevent product contamination per food safety and environmental protection); specify leak-tight construction and dry-break couplers (prevent spills and environmental releases); specify sump pump capacity adequate for containment evacuation per DEL-10.03 regulatory compliance calculations (environmental protection through spill recovery) | Datasheet.md §Conditions (food-grade product requirements drive material selections in data sheets); §Construction (pump sizing for containment drainage per OBJ-7 environmental protection) |

**Data Sheet Development Principles:**

| Principle | Application | Specification Link | Rationale | Procedure Link |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Completeness** | All required fields populated for each data sheet (identification, process data, construction, materials, standards — no missing sections); All equipment in scope documented (32 arms all have data sheets, quick-connects all documented, pump(s) all documented); No missing information without justification (if field cannot be populated, mark TBD with reason — awaiting vendor data, awaiting ER clarification, etc.) | Specification.md FN-04 through FN-07 (all required fields); FN-01 through FN-03 (all equipment documented); FN-08 (ER requirements **TBD** may specify additional fields) | Complete data sheets serve intended purposes (procurement requires complete specifications — incomplete data sheets delay procurement; installation requires complete information — missing data causes field questions and delays); Quality assurance (completeness checked independently per QA-04 — missing information identified before issue); Professional documentation (complete data sheets reflect thoroughness and attention to detail) | Procedure.md Step 3 (populate all required fields; mark TBD if information not available with justification); Step 5 (checker verifies completeness — all required fields populated or TBD justified) |
| **Accuracy** | Data reflects design intent and calculation results accurately (no transcription errors, no calculation errors, no misinterpretation of sources); Process conditions from DEL-10.03 calculations accurate (flow rates, pressures, temperatures correctly transferred from calculation results to data sheets); Specifications from DEL-10.02 accurate (materials, standards, performance requirements correctly reflected in data sheets); Drawing references from DEL-10.01 accurate (equipment locations, P&ID references, tags match drawings) | Specification.md IF-01 (drawing references accurate), IF-02 (calculation data accurate); QA-05 (alignment with DEL-10.02 — accuracy of specifications); Guidance.md §Principles (accuracy principle) | Accuracy critical for procurement (incorrect specifications lead to wrong equipment procurement — cost impact, schedule impact, rework); Accuracy critical for safety (incorrect ratings lead to equipment operating outside safe limits — safety risk); Independent check verifies accuracy (QA-04 — checker catches errors before issue, preventing downstream problems) | Procedure.md Step 2 (accurately transfer data from sources — DEL-10.01, DEL-10.02, DEL-10.03; verify values during transfer), Step 3 (accurately populate data sheets from sources); Step 5 (checker verifies accuracy — cross-checks data sheets against sources, identifies errors for correction) |
| **Consistency** | Tagging and numbering consistent across package (tags per tagging scheme QA-01; data sheet numbers per numbering scheme; sequential and logical); Units consistent throughout package (same unit system used for all data sheets QA-02 — all flow rates in m³/hr or all in gpm, not mixed; all pressures in kPa or all in psi, not mixed); Terminology consistent (same terms used across data sheets and consistent with other deliverables — "unloading arm" not "loading arm" inconsistently; "quick-connect" not "coupler" alone inconsistently); Format consistent (all data sheets of same type use same template — all 32 arm data sheets have identical section structure, field labels, format; all pump data sheets use same format) | Specification.md QA-01 (consistent tagging), QA-02 (consistent units), QA-03 (consistent metadata/format); cross-document consistency (terminology consistent with DEL-10.01, DEL-10.02, DEL-10.03) | Consistency supports usability (users can find information easily if format consistent; reduces confusion; supports comparison between similar equipment — easy to compare arm specifications if all formatted identically); Consistency supports quality (inconsistencies indicate potential errors — checker looks for inconsistencies as error indicator); Consistency supports project coordination (consistent tagging and terminology across all deliverables — DEL-10.01, DEL-10.02, DEL-10.03, DEL-10.04 — critical for multi-discipline coordination) | Procedure.md Step 1 (establish consistent templates and tagging scheme — apply to all data sheets), Step 3 (use consistent format, tags, units when populating all data sheets); Step 5 (checker verifies consistency across package per QA-01, QA-02 — tag audit, unit check) |
| **Traceability** | Data traceable to design basis and sources (process conditions traceable to DEL-10.03 calculations, specifications traceable to DEL-10.02, locations/arrangements traceable to DEL-10.01, ER requirements traceable to ER clauses); Cross-references clear (data sheets reference drawings, calculations, specifications; other deliverables reference data sheets — mutual traceability); Sources cited where applicable (if data from vendor — cite vendor proposal or submittal; if data from calculation — reference DEL-10.03 calculation number; if data from code/standard — cite code/standard section) | Specification.md IF-01 (drawings referenced), IF-02 (calculations referenced), QA-05 (DEL-10.02 referenced); FN-05 (traceability per DEL-10.03 **NOTE:** this is DEL-10.03 requirement, not DEL-10.04 — but principle applies); Guidance.md §Principles (traceability principle from calculation deliverable applies to data sheets as well) | Traceability supports verification (checker can verify data sheet values against sources — calculations, specifications, drawings; verifies accuracy and consistency); Traceability supports future modifications (if equipment needs replacement or modification, traceable data sheets show basis for original specifications — supports engineering for modifications); Traceability supports coordination (clear references to drawings, specifications, calculations enable multi-deliverable coordination and integration) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain data from traceable sources — DEL-10.01, DEL-10.02, DEL-10.03; document sources), Step 3 (include cross-references in data sheets — drawing numbers, calculation references, specification references); Step 5 (checker verifies traceability — data from correct sources, references correct) |
| **Procurement-ready** | Data sheets contain sufficient detail for equipment procurement (performance requirements clear — flow, pressure, temperature, reach specified adequately for vendor bids; materials specified clearly — vendor knows what materials required; construction details adequate — vendor knows what type/configuration required; standards identified — vendor knows what codes/certifications required); Specifications unambiguous (no vague requirements — specific values, clear criteria, objective specifications enabling fair bid evaluation and equipment selection); Vendor can quote equipment meeting data sheet specifications (data sheets provide complete procurement basis — vendor can propose equipment, provide pricing, commit to specifications without excessive clarifications or RFIs) | All Specification.md FN and content requirements (UA-xx, SP-xx) ensure procurement-ready detail; Guidance.md §Principles (procurement-ready principle — sufficient detail for procurement) | Procurement success depends on complete specifications (incomplete data sheets delay procurement — vendors cannot quote accurately, RFIs delay process, procurement risk increases); Clear specifications enable competitive procurement (multiple vendors can bid on clearly specified equipment — competition improves pricing and quality; ambiguous specifications limit competition); Complete data sheets reduce procurement risk (vendor proposals directly comparable to requirements, less risk of non-conforming equipment, clearer scope for procurement) | Procedure.md Step 3 (populate data sheets with procurement-ready level of detail — all critical specifications for procurement clearly stated; performance, materials, construction adequate for vendor bidding); Step 4 (vendor coordination — if vendor equipment selected, verify vendor data completes data sheets for procurement execution) |

**Data Sheet Content Principles:**

| Principle | Rationale | Quality Link | Procedure Link | Specification Link |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Standard format** | Use consistent template for each equipment type (all 32 arm data sheets use identical format — same sections, same field labels, same organization; all pump data sheets use same pump template); Templates per project standards (use ER-provided templates if ER specifies format, or contractor standard templates, or industry-standard templates like API 610 for pumps); Consistent format supports usability and comparison (users familiar with format after reviewing first data sheet — find information easily in subsequent data sheets; easy to compare similar equipment — e.g., compare arm specifications across 32 arms to verify consistency or identify site-specific variations) | Specification.md QA-03 (consistent format/metadata); Datasheet.md §Attributes (format/template **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 1 (obtain/confirm data sheet templates per project standards — apply templates to all data sheets in package), Step 3 (populate data sheets using templates — consistent format for all data sheets of same type) | Specification.md QA-03 (metadata and format consistency requirement) |

| **Complete process/operating conditions** | All operating and design conditions specified (product, flow rate, temperature range — operating and design, pressure range — operating and design, ambient conditions, other parameters relevant to equipment — viscosity for arms affects performance, NPSH for pumps affects cavitation, area classification for motors affects electrical rating); Conditions from authoritative sources (DEL-10.03 calculations provide process conditions — flow rates, pressures, temperatures verified by engineering analysis; DEL-10.02 specifications provide design criteria — margins, ratings, limits from specifications); Conditions enable equipment selection (vendor can select equipment meeting operating conditions — adequate ratings, suitable materials, appropriate design for conditions) | Specification.md FN-05 (operating conditions section required); UA-02, SP-02 (specific conditions for arms and pumps); IF-02 (conditions from DEL-10.03 calculations) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain complete process conditions from DEL-10.03 calculations and DEL-10.02 specifications — gather all relevant parameters), Step 3 (populate complete operating conditions in each data sheet — all relevant parameters for equipment selection); Step 5 (checker verifies conditions complete and accurate per IF-02) | Specification.md FN-05 (process/operating conditions requirement); UA-02, SP-02 (conditions content requirements) |
| **Material specification clarity** | Materials fully specified for procurement (material types, grades, certifications clearly stated — e.g., "Wetted parts: SS316, ASTM A240, food-grade certified per NSF or equivalent" provides complete specification for procurement; not just "stainless steel" which is ambiguous — many stainless grades, not all food-grade certified); Material requirements per DEL-10.02 specifications (food-grade compatible for product contact per MT-01, seal materials compatible with product and temperature per MT-04, corrosion-resistant for outdoor exposure per MT-02/MT-03); Material certifications noted (if certifications required — food-grade certification, material test reports, manufacturer certifications — note requirement in data sheet for procurement and QA verification) | Specification.md FN-07 (materials section required); UA-03, SP-03 (specific material requirements); QA-05 (materials per DEL-10.02) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain material requirements from DEL-10.02 — detailed material specifications with grades, standards, certifications), Step 3 (populate materials clearly in data sheets — specify material types, grades, standards, certifications per DEL-10.02 requirements); Step 4 (if vendor equipment, verify vendor materials meet requirements — check material certifications); Step 5 (checker verifies materials specified clearly and per DEL-10.02) | Specification.md FN-07 (materials requirement); UA-03, SP-03 (material content requirements) |
| **Standards reference** | Applicable codes and standards identified (design codes for equipment — ASME B31.3 for piping components, API 610 for pumps if applicable, manufacturer standards if proprietary equipment; material standards — ASTM for materials; food-grade standards — FDA, NSF, 3-A, or other for food contact; other certifications — seismic qualification if required, pressure equipment certification in BC/Canada if required); Standards referenced support compliance verification (inspector can verify equipment complies with specified codes and standards; vendor knows what standards to comply with for equipment design, fabrication, testing) | Specification.md UA-06, SP-05 (standards section required in data sheets); §Standards (applicable standards for project listed — data sheets reference project-applicable standards for each equipment) | Procedure.md Step 3 (populate standards section from DEL-10.02 applicable standards and project codes/standards), Step 5 (verify standards appropriate for equipment and service) | Specification.md UA-06, SP-05 (standards reference requirements); §Standards (all applicable standards listed) |

| **Sump Pumps** | Service suitability (sump pump handles containment drainage — spills, rainwater, washwater; mixed fluid service requires materials compatible with canola oil + water + cleaning chemicals; may contain debris — open impeller or solids-handling capability if debris expected); Capacity per DEL-10.03 calculations (pump flow rate and head per containment calculations — flow rate = containment volume ÷ drainage time, head = sump depth + discharge elevation/losses; verify pump selection meets calculated duty with margin); Pump type selection (submersible vs. external vertical per trade-off — submersible simpler installation, less piping, no priming issues, easier sump access; external better for maintenance access, easier motor/seal service, lower motor replacement cost — see §Trade-offs); Environmental suitability (outdoor installation — motor suitable for outdoor service TEFC enclosure, weather-resistant; wet environment — pump suitable for sump service, submersible if submerged; winter operation — motor insulation suitable for low temperature); Area classification compatibility (motor rated for area classification per HAC study **TBD** — Class I Div 2 / Zone 2 rated motor if classified, general purpose if unclassified; coordinate with PKG-17 per IF-03); Control interface (manual or automatic operation — typical sump pump automatic via level switches; control interface with PKG-20 level switches for start/stop; coordinate with PKG-17 and PKG-21 for control circuit design if automated) | Size pump per DEL-10.03 containment calculations (flow rate and head from calculations — verify pump selection meets calculated duty; apply margin for pump degradation and reliability — typical 10–20% margin on pump capacity); Select pump type per site requirements and trade-off analysis (submersible recommended for simplicity if sump access adequate for motor replacement **PROPOSAL** — see §Trade-offs; external vertical if maintenance access critical or if discharge head excessive for submersible); Specify materials per service (wetted parts compatible with canola oil, water, cleaning chemicals — stainless steel or coated cast iron for casing, stainless impeller; seals compatible with fluids; motor suitable for outdoor/wet environment — TEFC enclosure or submersible motor); Coordinate electrical with PKG-17 (motor voltage per PKG-17 electrical supply — typical 480V 3-phase for >5 HP or 240V for smaller pumps **TBD**; motor area classification per PKG-17 HAC design; motor starter requirements per PKG-17 — DOL, VFD, soft starter **TBD**); Specify control interface (automatic operation typical for sump pump — level switches provide high alarm and pump start/stop control; coordinate level switch specifications with PKG-20; coordinate control circuit with PKG-17 and PKG-21 if automated control system) | Specification.md SP-01 (pump type, size requirements), SP-02 (pump flow/head from DEL-10.03), SP-03 (pump materials), SP-04 (pump electrical coordination with PKG-17); IF-03 (electrical interface with PKG-17) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain pump requirements from DEL-10.03 sizing, DEL-10.02 materials, PKG-17 electrical coordination), Step 3b (populate pump data sheet with complete specifications meeting all requirements); Step 4 (if vendor pump, verify vendor pump meets all requirements); Step 5 (verify pump specifications complete and coordinated per IF-03) |

**Process Condition Considerations (Data Sheet Operating Conditions):**

|-----------|---------------|--------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Flow rate per station** | From DEL-10.03 unloading rate calculations (calculated flow per station **TBD** m³/hr becomes specified arm flow capacity in data sheets); Verify arm flow capacity adequate (arm vendor data or selection must provide flow rate ≥ specified flow from DEL-10.03; verify with vendor Q-H curve at available railcar head); Account for variations (flow rate may vary with railcar head — full car higher flow rate than nearly empty car; data sheet may specify rated flow at design head, or flow range, or reference to vendor curve) | DEL-10.03 Unloading Rate Calculations (flow per station calculated); vendor data (arm Q-H curve if available — flow rate vs. head for specific arm model) | Arm data sheets specify flow rate in process data section (specified flow from DEL-10.03 or flow range if variable; reference vendor curve if available); Verify vendor arm selection meets specified flow (procurement specification — vendor proposes arm meeting or exceeding specified flow capacity at design head) | Specification.md UA-02 (arm flow rate in process conditions); IF-02 (flow rate from DEL-10.03 calculations) |

| **Quick-connect seals** | Product compatibility (seals compatible with canola oil — no swelling, degradation, extractables contaminating product); Temperature compatibility (seals functional over ambient temperature range −15°C to +35°C **TBD** — low temperature affects seal flexibility and sealing capability, high temperature affects seal degradation); Food-grade certification (seals in product contact require food-grade certification or compliance with food contact regulations); Leak-tightness (seals provide leak-tight connection during operations and dry-break on disconnection — critical for environmental protection OBJ-7 and operational safety OBJ-1); Durability (seals withstand frequent connection/disconnection cycles — may be thousands of cycles per year; seal replacement frequency acceptable — more durable seals reduce maintenance) | EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer — good general-purpose elastomer; canola oil compatible; food-grade grades available; temperature range typically −40°C to +120°C; economical), Viton / FKM (fluoroelastomer — excellent chemical resistance, canola oil compatible; food-grade grades available; temperature range typically −20°C to +200°C; more expensive than EPDM but more durable), PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene — excellent chemical resistance, canola oil compatible; food-grade; temperature range −200°C to +260°C; low friction; more expensive; requires special seal designs), Other approved food-grade elastomers (verify compatibility with canola oil, temperature range, food-grade certification from manufacturer or material data) | Specification.md UA-03 (seal materials in arm materials section), UA-04 (seal materials in quick-connect section); DEL-10.02 MT-04 (seal material requirements — product compatible, temperature-rated, food-grade) | (Seal material selection typically per vendor standard for selected quick-connect type — verify vendor seal materials meet DEL-10.02 MT-04 requirements; alternative seal materials may be specified if vendor standard seals inadequate) |

**Tagging Considerations (Equipment Identification — Critical for Project Coordination):**

| Aspect | Consideration | Guidance | Specification Link | Procedure Link |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Tag scheme format** | Consistent with project tagging standard **TBD** (obtain tagging standard from ER or contractor procedures; apply consistently to all equipment); Systematic and logical (tag format enables equipment identification — equipment type, area, sequential number clear from tag; e.g., UA-10-001 indicates Unloading Arm, Area 10, sequential 001; or simplified UA-1001 if area designation not needed); Unique project-wide (tags must be unique across entire project — not just within PKG-10; coordinate with other packages to avoid duplicate tags; verify tag uniqueness in project tag database or register if available) | Establish tagging scheme early (Step 1 of procedure — before populating data sheets; obtain project tagging standard from ER **TBD** or contractor procedures; confirm scheme with discipline lead and document control), Apply scheme consistently (all 32 arms tagged per scheme — e.g., UA-1001 through UA-1032 sequential; pumps tagged per scheme — e.g., P-1001, P-1002; quick-connects tagged as components of arms or separately per scheme **TBD**), Verify tag uniqueness (check against project tag register to avoid duplicates; coordinate with other packages if shared tag space — e.g., if PKG-12, PKG-14, PKG-15 also have pumps, coordinate "P-" prefix tags to avoid conflicts) | Specification.md QA-01 (consistent tagging requirement); FN-04 (tag in identification section) | Procedure.md Step 1 (establish tagging scheme per project standard), Step 3 (assign tags to all equipment per scheme when populating data sheets); Step 5 (tag audit — verify tags consistent, unique, per scheme) |
| **Sequential numbering** | Logical sequence for 32 arms (number arms sequentially per station locations — e.g., UA-1001 at Station 1, UA-1002 at Station 2, ..., UA-1032 at Station 32; logical correlation between tag and location supports operations and maintenance — operators/maintainers know station number from arm tag); Sequential numbering for other equipment (pumps numbered P-1001, P-1002, etc. if multiple pumps; logical sequence per containment zones or sump locations from DEL-10.01) | Number arms per station sequence (if 32 stations numbered 1–32, tag arms UA-1001 through UA-1032 corresponding to stations; if stations have different numbering, coordinate tags with station numbers), Document tag-to-location correlation (equipment list shows tag and location for each piece of equipment — supports field identification and coordination with drawings), Verify sequence logical (tags should follow logical order matching physical layout — supports construction, operations, maintenance) | Specification.md QA-01 (systematic tagging); FN-04 (location in identification section) | Procedure.md Step 1 (establish sequential tag numbering scheme), Step 3 (assign sequential tags correlated to locations from DEL-10.01) |
| **Location reference in data sheets** | Tags should correlate to physical locations clearly (data sheet identification section includes location field — station number, area designation, coordinates, or other location descriptor matching DEL-10.01 drawings); Location enables equipment to be found (operators, maintainers, inspectors can find equipment on site using data sheet location information; location correlates to DEL-10.01 drawing locations — equipment tag on data sheet matches tag on drawings, location on data sheet matches location on drawings) | Populate location field clearly in each data sheet (e.g., "Location: Station 15, Unloading Area, Railcar Position 15" provides clear location; or "Location: per DEL-10.01 Dwg GA-001, Station 15" references drawing for location), Coordinate locations with DEL-10.01 (verify locations in data sheets match equipment locations on drawings — consistency critical), Use location descriptors per project convention (station numbers, area designations, grid coordinates, or other per project site layout and drawing conventions) | Specification.md FN-04 (location in identification section requirement); IF-01 (drawing references enable location identification) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain equipment locations from DEL-10.01 drawings), Step 3 (populate location field in each data sheet per DEL-10.01 locations); Step 5 (verify locations consistent with DEL-10.01 per IF-01) |
| **P&ID reference** | Data sheets reference P&ID if P&IDs developed (P&ID number and equipment tag on P&ID — enables cross-referencing between data sheets and P&IDs); **TBD** — verify if P&IDs developed for this project (some projects have detailed P&IDs showing all equipment and piping; other projects use simplified flow diagrams or equipment layouts without formal P&IDs; coordinate with project deliverables to determine if P&IDs exist or will be developed) | If P&IDs exist: Obtain P&ID numbers and verify equipment tags on P&IDs (coordinate with P&ID development team — may be part of DEL-10.01 or separate deliverable **TBD**), Populate P&ID reference in each data sheet (P&ID number and tag in identification section — e.g., "P&ID: P&ID-10-001, Tag UA-1001"), Verify tags consistent between data sheets and P&IDs (tags match — critical for coordination); If P&IDs do not exist: Mark P&ID reference as "N/A — no P&IDs for this project" or leave blank with note; Use drawing references per IF-01 instead (DEL-10.01 drawings serve as equipment location reference in lieu of P&IDs) | Specification.md FN-04 (P&ID reference in identification section — if applicable **TBD**); IF-01 (drawing references — may substitute for P&ID references if no P&IDs) | Procedure.md Step 2 (determine if P&IDs exist; obtain P&ID numbers and tags if applicable), Step 3 (populate P&ID reference if applicable, or mark N/A if no P&IDs) |

## Trade-offs

**Equipment Selection Trade-offs (Require Vendor Survey and Human Ruling):**

| Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Considerations | Specification Link | Recommended Approach | Decision Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Sump pump type (submersible vs. external)** | **Submersible pump:** Pump and motor submerged in sump (fully submersible design); Advantages: simpler installation (no pump house or weather protection required; no suction piping — pump submerged in fluid), no priming issues (pump always primed — submerged in sump), easier sump access for pump removal (lift pump out of sump — no piping disconnect required), quieter operation (pump submerged — noise attenuated); Disadvantages: motor replacement more difficult (must remove pump from sump — may require lifting equipment; motor not accessible for inspection without pump removal), motor more expensive (submersible motors more expensive than standard motors — sealed construction, submersible cable entry), maintenance access (pump service requires sump access — may be confined space if deep sump; safety considerations for personnel access to sump) | **External vertical pump:** Pump and motor external to sump (pump mounted outside sump or on sump cover; suction piping into sump); Advantages: easier motor maintenance (motor accessible without pump removal — motor inspection, bearing service, replacement easier), lower motor cost (standard TEFC motor vs. submersible motor — lower cost, more readily available), easier maintenance access (pump and motor above ground — no sump entry required for service); Disadvantages: more complex installation (pump mounting structure, suction piping, weather protection or pump house may be required), priming required (pump not submerged — may need priming provisions or self-priming pump), more noise (pump and motor external — noise not attenuated by sump), larger footprint (pump and motor require space external to sump) | **Installation vs. maintenance trade-off:** Submersible simpler installation but maintenance requires sump access; external more complex installation but maintenance easier. **Cost:** Submersible motor more expensive, but installation savings may offset; external motor cheaper but installation more complex (piping, structure, weather protection costs). **Operations:** Submersible quieter and simpler operations (no priming); external may be noisier and requires priming considerations. **Site constraints:** Sump access and space availability may favor one type (limited sump access favors external for maintenance; limited external space favors submersible). **Safety:** Sump entry for submersible maintenance may be confined space (safety procedures required); external maintenance above ground safer. **OBJ-1 (safe operation, maintainability):** External may be safer for maintenance (no sump entry); submersible simpler operations. **TBD** — Evaluate based on: sump access (is sump accessible for submersible motor removal? confined space?), maintenance philosophy (prefer simpler operations vs. easier maintenance?), cost analysis (compare installed costs — submersible motor premium vs. external installation complexity), site space constraints, Employer preference. | Specification.md SP-01 (pump type requirement — submersible or external **TBD** per selection) | **PROPOSAL:** Submersible pumps for simplicity and typical sump service (submersible centrifugal pumps standard for sump drainage applications; simpler installation; adequate for containment drainage service; motor replacement acceptable with lifting equipment and sump access provisions). External vertical pumps if: sump access severely limited (confined space hazard makes submersible maintenance unsafe), or discharge head excessive for submersible pump capability (submersible pumps typically limited to ~20–30m head; if higher head required per DEL-10.03, external vertical pump needed), or if Employer/operations strongly prefers easier motor maintenance access. **TBD** — Select pump type during Step 1 scope definition or Step 3 pump data sheet development (coordinate with Employer for preference; evaluate sump access safety; verify pump head requirements from DEL-10.03 within submersible pump capability; document selection rationale with trade-off considerations). Decision affects pump data sheet specifications (pump type, mounting, motor type, installation requirements). | **TBD** — Select during data sheet development (Procedure.md Step 1 or Step 3b); coordinate with Employer and operations for preference; document decision with rationale |

**ASSUMPTION:** Trade-off decision documented in data sheet notes or separate equipment selection basis document. Human ruling or coordination with Employer required for pump type selection (affects cost, installation, maintenance — significant decision). Document decision rationale including trade-off analysis, site constraints, Employer preference, cost impact, maintenance philosophy.

**Standardization vs. Optimization (Equipment Procurement Strategy):**

| Consideration | Standardization Approach | Optimization Approach | Recommendation |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **32 unloading arms** | Standardize all 32 arms (same vendor, same model, same specifications for all arms); Advantages: simplified procurement (single bid for 32 arms — volume pricing, single vendor coordination), simplified spare parts inventory (one set of spare parts for all 32 arms — seals, bearings, components interchangeable), simplified maintenance (maintainers familiar with single arm type — standardized procedures, training, troubleshooting), simplified operations (operators familiar with single arm type — consistent operations across all 32 stations); Disadvantages: may not be optimized for site-specific variations (if some stations have tighter clearances, track curvature, or other constraints — standard arm may not be optimal for all stations; custom optimization for specific stations not possible) | Optimize arms per station-specific requirements (different arms for different stations if constraints vary — e.g., tighter clearance arms for constrained stations, longer reach arms for curved track sections, etc.); Advantages: each arm optimized for specific station (better fit, better performance for site-specific constraints); Disadvantages: complex procurement (multiple bid packages, multiple vendors potentially, complex coordination), complex spare parts (different spare parts for different arm types — larger inventory, more complex management), complex maintenance (maintainers must be familiar with multiple arm types — more training, more procedures, more troubleshooting complexity), complex operations (operators must be familiar with multiple arm types — more training, potential for operational errors) | **RECOMMENDED:** Standardization approach — specify identical arms for all 32 stations unless site constraints require variations (standardization benefits significantly outweigh optimization benefits for this application — 32 arms with consistent specifications simplify procurement, spare parts, maintenance, operations per OBJ-1 operational considerations; cost benefits from volume procurement). **Exceptions:** If specific stations have constraints preventing standard arm use (e.g., severe clearance restrictions, unusual track curvature, interference requiring custom reach — coordinate with DEL-10.01 arrangement to identify constrained stations), specify custom arm for those stations only (minimize custom variations — e.g., 30 standard + 2 custom is manageable; 5 different arm types across 32 stations is excessive complexity — avoid unless absolutely necessary). **TBD** — Verify station constraints from DEL-10.01 final layout (identify any stations with unusual constraints); coordinate with Employer for standardization preference; document standardization approach in equipment list or procurement strategy. Standardization decision affects all 32 arm data sheets (identical specifications for standard arms; variant specifications for custom arms if needed) and procurement (single bid package vs. multiple packages). |

**ASSUMPTION:** Preference for standardization unless specific benefit from optimization justified and Employer approves (standardization aligns with industry practice for facilities with multiple identical equipment — reduces lifecycle cost per OBJ-9 if applicable, improves operational reliability per OBJ-1). Document standardization approach and any exceptions with justification.

Applicable Standards and Certifications** | Pump standards (API 610 / ISO 13709 if applicable **TBD**, or manufacturer standards if commercial pump); Motor standards (NEMA MG-1 or IEC for motor design and testing); Electrical standards (NEC for electrical installation per PKG-17; area classification standards if applicable); Material standards (ASTM for pump materials); Food-grade certification (if required for sump service **TBD** — verify with Employer or regulatory authority if sump pump wetted parts require food-grade certification; may not be required if pump handles only spills and washwater, not pure product for process); Other certifications (if applicable — pressure equipment certification in BC, seismic qualification if required, other regulatory certifications) | Specification.md SP-05 (standards reference requirement); §Standards (applicable pump standards) | Datasheet.md §Construction (standards section in pump data sheet); §Conditions (food-grade requirement, seismic requirement, regulatory requirements affect certifications) |
| **8. Notes / Special Requirements** | Special requirements (any project-specific or site-specific requirements — e.g., outdoor installation provisions, winterization provisions if low-temperature operation, confined space considerations for submersible pump maintenance); Control interface (level switch interface per PKG-20 — high alarm, pump start/stop levels; control voltage and logic per PKG-17/PKG-21); Discharge piping (discharge connection details — size, type; discharge routing per DEL-10.01 and PKG-14 interface **TBD** if discharge to process or separate drain); Maintenance access (provisions for pump removal/service; lifting equipment if heavy; sump access safety if confined space); Vendor options (if vendor can propose alternatives or options — note acceptable variations or options); TBDs (note any information to be confirmed — e.g., "Control interface details to be finalized with PKG-20/PKG-21"; "Discharge piping routing per PKG-14 interface — TBD") | Specification.md (notes capture special requirements, interfaces, TBDs not fitting standard fields) | Datasheet.md §Construction (notes section in pump data sheet) |

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| — | No conflicts identified at this stage | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:**
- Conflicts may emerge during data sheet development (Procedure.md Steps 2–3) if sources provide conflicting data: e.g., DEL-10.03 calculates flow rate = X m³/hr, but vendor data shows arm capacity = Y m³/hr < X (vendor equipment inadequate for calculated requirement — conflict between calculated requirement and available equipment); DEL-10.02 specifies stainless steel, but vendor proposes aluminum (material substitution — requires evaluation of acceptability per DEL-10.02 material requirements and food-grade compliance); Drawing locations from DEL-10.01 do not match calculated reach requirements from DEL-10.03 (layout/performance conflict — may require layout revision or arm specification revision). Document conflicts in this table; analyze options; propose resolution; request human ruling if cannot resolve technically.
- Vendor data conflicts: If vendor-supplied data differs from design requirements (vendor equipment performance, materials, or specifications do not exactly match data sheet requirements — common in procurement where vendor standard products may not precisely match custom specifications), evaluate acceptability (if vendor equipment meets or exceeds critical requirements — flow, pressure, temperature, materials — minor variations may be acceptable; if vendor equipment deficient in critical requirements — inadequate capacity, incompatible materials, insufficient ratings — not acceptable without design revision). Document evaluation; obtain discipline lead or Employer approval for significant variations; update data sheets with vendor data if variations accepted (note variance and approval in data sheet notes).
- Trade-off requiring human ruling: Pump type selection (submersible vs. external) per §Trade-offs requires coordination with Employer and operations (preference for installation simplicity vs. maintenance access; cost/benefit analysis; site constraints). Document ruling in data sheet notes or equipment selection basis.
