| **Header pipe sizing** | Header capacity ≥ design throughput + margin (**TBD** margin — typically 10–25%); Flow velocity within acceptable range (**TBD** — typically 1.5–3 m/s for oils; minimum for self-draining, maximum to prevent erosion); Slope achievable with layout (calculated slope requirements feasible with site elevations per DEL-10.01); Pressure drop acceptable (gravity head ≥ total pressure losses — gravity flow viable without pumping) | PF-01 (header capacity requirement with margin); Industry practice for velocity limits; ASME B31.3 velocity guidance **TBD**; Gravity flow viability (fundamental requirement for gravity system) | Header sizing calculation results; checker verification; comparison to acceptance criteria in results summary | Procedure.md Step 4b (header sizing with acceptance criteria verification); Step 1 (acceptance criterion defined: capacity > design + margin) |
| **Unloading rate / throughput** | Calculated annual throughput ≥ 1,000,000 MT/annum (demonstrate capacity meets minimum requirement); Preferably with margin (demonstrate capacity exceeds 1,000,000 MT/annum — e.g., 1,100,000–1,250,000 MT/annum with design assumptions — provides operational flexibility per OBJ-4 and future expansion capability per OBJ-8 if applicable); Unloading time per railcar acceptable (**TBD** — verify unloading time meets ER requirements or operations plan; typical 30–60 minutes); 32 stations adequate (required simultaneous stations + margin ≤ 32 available stations — demonstrates adequate station count) | PF-02 (throughput capacity requirement ≥ 1,000,000 MT/annum); Decomposition §1, §2 OBJ-2 (throughput objective); ER Vol 2 unloading time requirements **TBD**; OBJ-4 (operational flexibility — margin supports flexibility) | Unloading rate calculation results; checker verification; comparison to 1,000,000 MT/annum in results summary | Procedure.md Step 4a (throughput verification with acceptance criterion); Step 1 (acceptance criterion defined: ≥ 1,000,000 MT/annum) |
| **Containment volume** | Calculated containment volume ≥ regulatory requirement (**TBD** — Environment Canada, BC regulations; typically 110% of largest vessel or 100% + freeboard + rainfall allowance); Worst-case spill scenario identified and volume calculated (largest credible spill — typically one railcar or largest header section); Regulatory compliance demonstrated (calculation shows compliance with specific regulation — cite regulation and demonstrate formula/criteria met) | PF-03 (containment compliance requirement); Environmental regulations **TBD** (regulatory minimum volume); OBJ-7 (environmental protection — regulatory compliance critical) | Containment volume calculation results; checker verification; regulatory compliance statement in results summary; comparison to regulatory requirement | Procedure.md Step 4c (containment volume with regulatory compliance verification); Step 1 (acceptance criterion defined: ≥ regulatory requirement) |
| **Documentation** | All inputs documented with sources (per IN-01 through IN-05); all assumptions documented with justification (per Step 3); all methods documented with references (per QA-03); all results presented with comparison to acceptance criteria; calculation reproducible by independent checker (per QA-01) | FN-04 (documentation requirement); QA-03 (reproducibility requirement); Industry practice for calculation documentation | Document review by checker (verify documentation complete per FN-04 requirements) and discipline lead (verify documentation adequate during approval Step 6) | Procedure.md Steps 2, 3, 4 (document inputs, assumptions, methods); Step 5 (checker verifies documentation complete and reproducible) |
| **TBD** — **Additional acceptance criteria per Employer's Requirements** | (e.g., Specific design margins, specific velocity limits, specific safety factors, specific analysis cases, third-party review requirements) | ER Vol 2 clauses **TBD** | **TBD** — per ER verification requirements | Procedure.md Step 1 (define ER acceptance criteria during scope definition) |

**Non-Conformance Handling:**
- Calculation errors identified during independent check (Step 5) to be corrected and recalculated (arithmetic errors, method errors, input errors — correct and reissue for checking)
- Results not meeting acceptance criteria: investigate and resolve (if results do not meet acceptance criteria — e.g., header capacity insufficient, throughput below 1,000,000 MT/annum, containment volume below regulatory minimum — revise design assumptions, resize equipment, revise layout, or other design changes to achieve acceptable results; coordinate design changes with DEL-10.01, DEL-10.02, DEL-10.04; recalculate with revised design; verify acceptance criteria met)
- **TBD** — Non-conformance procedure per project quality plan (may require non-conformance reports if results do not meet criteria; corrective action; design revision; re-review)
