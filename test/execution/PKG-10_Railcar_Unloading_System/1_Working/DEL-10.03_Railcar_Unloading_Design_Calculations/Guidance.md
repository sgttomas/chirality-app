# Guidance: DEL-10.03 Railcar Unloading Design Calculations

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of the **Railcar Unloading Design Calculations** for **PKG-10 Railcar Unloading System**.

The Design Calculations provide the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for the railcar unloading system, demonstrating that the design can achieve 1,000,000 MT/annum throughput (OBJ-2) with 32 unloading stations operating by gravity flow, with adequate spill containment (OBJ-7) and safe operating margins (OBJ-1). Calculations size critical components (header piping, containment system) and verify system performance, providing the technical foundation for design drawings (DEL-10.01), technical specifications (DEL-10.02), and equipment data sheets (DEL-10.04).

## Considerations

**Header Pipe Sizing Considerations:**

| Factor | Consideration | Guidance | Specification Link | Procedure Link |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Flow regime** | Gravity flow can be open channel (partially full header with free surface and atmospheric pressure) or full pipe flow with slope (closed header operating full with gravity head driving flow); Determine flow regime based on header configuration from DEL-10.01 (vented header may operate as open channel; closed header with vapor space operates as full pipe flow); Flow regime affects sizing method selection (Manning equation for open channel; Darcy-Weisbach or Hazen-Williams for full pipe) | Determine header configuration from DEL-10.01 or preliminary design (open vs. closed header; vent configuration); Select sizing method appropriate to flow regime (open channel methods for open header; pipe flow methods for closed header); If uncertain, analyze both regimes and select conservative result (larger pipe size provides adequate capacity for either regime); Document regime determination and method selection rationale | Specification.md FN-01 (header sizing); Datasheet.md §Construction (sizing method selection — Manning or Darcy-Weisbach per flow regime) | Procedure.md Step 4b (determine flow regime; select method; document selection rationale) |
| **Sizing method** | Multiple methods available for pipe flow: Manning equation (open channel flow — best for partially full gravity flow with free surface; requires channel geometry, roughness, slope), Darcy-Weisbach equation (full pipe flow — accurate for all fluids including viscous oils; requires friction factor from Moody diagram or Colebrook-White; accounts for viscosity effects), Hazen-Williams equation (full pipe flow — simpler than Darcy-Weisbach but less accurate for viscous fluids; widely used for water but may overestimate capacity for oils; use with caution for canola oil); Select method based on flow regime, fluid properties, required accuracy | For open channel flow (if header partially full): use Manning equation with appropriate roughness coefficient (n = 0.012–0.015 for steel, depending on condition); For full pipe flow (if header operates full): prefer Darcy-Weisbach for viscous fluids like canola oil (accounts for viscosity effects on friction factor; more accurate than Hazen-Williams for oils); Hazen-Williams acceptable for preliminary sizing or verification but note limitations for viscous fluids; Document method selection and justification; Cite reference for method (code, handbook, or engineering reference) | Specification.md FN-01 (header sizing method); §Standards (hydraulic references for methods); Datasheet.md §Construction (method selection documented) | Procedure.md Step 4b (select sizing method per flow regime and fluid properties; apply method with appropriate equations and friction factors; cite references) |
| **Velocity limits** | Flow velocity must be within acceptable range: Minimum velocity for self-draining and solids transport (if applicable — may not be critical for clean canola oil but ensures drainage and prevents stagnation; typical minimum 0.5–1.0 m/s for drainage), Maximum velocity to prevent erosion and excessive pressure drop (typical maximum 1.5–3.0 m/s for vegetable oils; higher velocities acceptable if erosion/corrosion verified acceptable — stainless steel more resistant than carbon steel; verify with ASME B31.3 velocity guidance **TBD**); Optimal velocity for efficiency (balance pressure drop and pipe size — higher velocity reduces pipe size but increases pressure drop; lower velocity increases pipe size but reduces pressure drop — optimize for gravity flow viability) | Apply velocity limits per industry practice and code guidance: Minimum velocity **TBD** (typical 0.5–1.0 m/s for drainage; verify with project requirements or industry practice), Maximum velocity **TBD** (typical 1.5–3.0 m/s for vegetable oils; verify with ASME B31.3 or industry practice; may be higher for stainless steel due to erosion resistance); Verify calculated velocity within limits (if velocity too low, increase slope or reduce pipe size; if velocity too high, decrease slope or increase pipe size); Balance velocity and pipe size for optimal design (consider cost — larger pipe more expensive but lower pressure drop and velocity; smaller pipe less expensive but higher pressure drop and velocity) | Specification.md PF-01 (velocity verification requirement); Datasheet.md §Construction (velocity verification in header sizing) | Procedure.md Step 4b (calculate velocity; verify within acceptable range per limits **TBD**; adjust pipe size or slope if needed to achieve acceptable velocity) |
| **Slope requirements** | Header slope critical for gravity flow and drainage: Minimum slope for gravity drainage (typically 1:100 = 1% = 0.01 m/m minimum for reliable drainage; steeper slopes acceptable and improve drainage; verify with code or industry practice **TBD**), Maximum slope limited by practical installation and site constraints (very steep slopes may be difficult to install; limited by available elevation difference and horizontal distance; coordinate with site elevations from DEL-10.01 and PKG-05 structural), Actual slope from DEL-10.01 layout (if layout available — use actual slopes from profile drawings; if preliminary — assume slopes and verify achievable with site elevations) | Specify minimum slope requirement (1:100 minimum typical; verify with project requirements or code if specified); Use actual slopes from DEL-10.01 if available (preferred — calculations verify actual layout); Use assumed slopes if preliminary (assume reasonable slopes — e.g., 1:100 to 1:50; verify achievable with site constraints; mark as assumption; verify when DEL-10.01 layout available); Verify slope achievable (check available elevation difference ÷ horizontal distance ≥ required slope; coordinate with site elevations from PKG-05 or site survey); If slope inadequate for required capacity: increase slope if possible (coordinate with DEL-10.01 and PKG-05), or increase pipe size to achieve capacity at available slope | Specification.md PF-01 (slope verification requirement); FN-01 (slope verification in header sizing); Datasheet.md §Construction (slope verification and drainage capability) | Procedure.md Step 4b (verify slope requirements; use slopes from DEL-10.01 or document assumed slopes; verify slope achievable with site elevations; verify capacity adequate at available slope) |
| **Design margin** | Header capacity should exceed design throughput by margin (not sized exactly to minimum requirement); Margin purposes: operational flexibility (accommodate operational variations, peak demands above average), future expansion (support throughput increases per OBJ-8 if applicable — verify if OBJ-8 included in project objectives), uncertainty allowance (account for uncertainties in inputs — product properties, operating conditions, equipment performance may vary from assumed values; margin provides buffer against under-capacity), degradation allowance (pipe roughness may increase over time due to fouling, corrosion — margin accommodates degradation); Margin selection: **TBD** (typically 10–25% overcapacity; select based on uncertainty, flexibility requirements, cost impact — higher margin increases pipe size and cost but provides more operational flexibility and robustness) | Apply design margin per project requirements or industry practice: Typical margin 10–25% overcapacity (select within range based on project requirements **TBD**, uncertainty level, operational flexibility importance), Document margin selection rationale (justify margin based on operational flexibility per OBJ-4, uncertainty in inputs, future expansion per OBJ-8 if applicable), Verify margin achievable (ensure margin does not result in excessive pipe size — cost impact, installation difficulty, velocity too low), Report capacity as design throughput + margin (e.g., "Header capacity = 1,250 MT/hr = 1,000 MT/hr design + 25% margin for operational flexibility") | Specification.md PF-01 (margin requirement); Datasheet.md §Conditions (design margin **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 4b (apply design margin; document margin selection rationale); Step 1 (define margin in acceptance criteria — capacity ≥ design + margin) |
| **Air entrainment and release** | Gravity flow headers may entrain air (air pockets can cause vapor locks, reduce flow capacity, create operational problems); Air release provisions required at high points (automatic air release valves prevent air accumulation); Air entrainment in calculation: if significant air entrainment expected (turbulent flow, fall distances, cascading flows), account for air in sizing (two-phase flow calculation may be required **TBD** — complex; simplified approach: size header for liquid-only flow with margin to accommodate air effects); Vent sizing: **TBD** (atmospheric vents on header or individual stations; size vents for vapor displacement during unloading; coordinate with DEL-10.02 venting requirements) | Provide air release provisions in header design (automatic air release valves at high points shown on DEL-10.01 Header Layout; specified in DEL-10.02), If air entrainment significant: account in sizing (apply margin to accommodate air effects — e.g., 15–25% margin partially accommodates air; or perform two-phase flow calculation if accuracy critical **TBD**), If air entrainment minimal (low turbulence, smooth flow): liquid-only calculation with standard margin adequate, Vent sizing calculation **TBD** (may be separate calculation or included in this deliverable; coordinate with DEL-10.02 for vent requirements) | Specification.md FN-01 (air release consideration in header sizing); Datasheet.md §Construction (air entrainment consideration; vent sizing **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 4b (consider air entrainment in header sizing; provide air release provisions; document approach to air handling — margin or two-phase flow calculation) |

**Unloading Rate Calculation Considerations:**

| Factor | Consideration | Guidance | Specification Link | Procedure Link |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Throughput basis** | Annual capacity 1,000,000 MT must be converted to required rate: Operating hours per year **TBD** (e.g., 8,000 hr/yr assumes ~22 hr/day × 365 days accounting for downtime, maintenance, holidays; or 6,000 hr/yr for 16 hr/day × 375 days/yr; affects required hourly rate significantly), Required hourly rate (1,000,000 MT/annum ÷ operating hours/yr = MT/hr; convert to volumetric rate using product density ~920 kg/m³), Peak rate vs. average (if peak periods require higher rate than annual average — e.g., harvest season peaks — **TBD** verify if peak rate specified in ER or use annual average as design basis) | Obtain operating schedule from ER **TBD** (ER may specify operating hours, shift patterns, seasonal variations); If ER does not specify: make reasonable assumption (document assumption and justification — e.g., "Assumed 8,000 operating hours per year based on 22 hr/day operation with 2 hr/day downtime allowance for maintenance, railcar delays, etc."); Convert annual capacity to hourly rate accounting for operating schedule; Consider peak rate requirements if specified (design for peak rate may require higher capacity than annual average basis — verify with ER or Employer) | Specification.md PF-02 (throughput requirement); Datasheet.md §Conditions (operating schedule parameter **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain operating schedule from ER or document assumption); Step 4a (calculate required hourly rate from annual capacity and operating hours) |
| **Station capacity** | Flow rate per station depends on multiple factors: Railcar head pressure (static head from product level in railcar — typically 2–4m head for full railcar decreasing as railcar empties; affects gravity flow rate), Arm design and pressure drop (pressure drop through unloading arm, swivel joints, quick-connect — vendor-specific; affects flow rate for given head), Product viscosity (viscosity affects flow rate and pressure drop — temperature dependent; higher viscosity reduces flow rate; winterization considerations **TBD**), Piping configuration (arm discharge piping to header — pipe diameter, length, fittings affect pressure drop and flow rate), Branch connection to header (connection type — swept or abrupt — affects back-pressure from header on individual station flow) | Obtain arm flow capacity from vendor data: Prefer vendor Q-H curve (flow rate vs. head curve for specific arm model; most accurate method using actual equipment performance data), If vendor data not available: first-principles calculation (calculate flow rate using Bernoulli equation, orifice flow equations, or pipe flow equations accounting for arm geometry, quick-connect restriction, piping; requires assumptions about arm internal configuration — less accurate than vendor data), If neither available: use industry typical values with assumption (typical 50–200 m³/hr for gravity unloading arms; justify based on industry precedents; mark as assumption; verify when vendor data available); Account for head variation (railcar head decreases as unloading progresses; use average head or time-averaged flow rate for unloading time calculation) | Specification.md IN-04 (equipment data input — arm flow capacity); PF-02 (unloading rate verification); Datasheet.md §Conditions (unloading rate per station **TBD** from vendor data or calculation) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain arm flow capacity from DEL-10.04 or vendor data; if not available, calculate or assume with justification); Step 4a (use arm flow capacity in throughput calculation; account for head variation if significant) |
| **Simultaneous operations** | Number of stations unloading simultaneously critical for throughput and header sizing: Determine required simultaneous operations from throughput requirement (required hourly throughput ÷ flow per station = minimum simultaneous stations; round up to integer; add margin **TBD** % for operational flexibility — typically 10–25% margin means design for more simultaneous operations than strict minimum, providing operational flexibility per OBJ-4), Operating scenarios (normal operations — typical simultaneous stations under normal conditions; peak operations — maximum simultaneous stations for peak demand; partial operations — reduced simultaneous stations for maintenance, outages, startup/shutdown; verify system functional under various scenarios), Verify 32 stations adequate (required simultaneous + margin ≤ 32 available stations; demonstrate adequate capacity), Sensitivity to assumptions (simultaneous operations depend on operating schedule assumptions, flow rate per station assumptions — perform sensitivity analysis varying key assumptions to demonstrate design robust **TBD**) | Determine realistic simultaneous operations: Not likely all 32 stations operate simultaneously continuously (some stations down for maintenance, railcar delays, product switches, etc.), Typical simultaneous operations **TBD** (may be 4–16 stations based on operating schedule, unloading time, railcar availability — verify with ER operating scenario requirements or operations planning assumptions), Design simultaneous operations = required minimum + margin (provides operational flexibility; accounts for peak periods; supports partial operations scenarios), Document simultaneous operations assumption clearly (critical assumption affecting header sizing and throughput verification — mark as key assumption; verify with Employer or operations planning when data available); Sensitivity analysis recommended (vary simultaneous operations ±20–50% to demonstrate system meets throughput under range of operating scenarios — demonstrates robustness of design) | Specification.md PF-02 (throughput verification with simultaneous operations determination); Datasheet.md §Conditions (simultaneous operations parameter **TBD** — critical design assumption) | Procedure.md Step 3 (document simultaneous operations assumption with justification — critical assumption); Step 4a (determine required simultaneous operations; verify 32 stations adequate; perform sensitivity analysis **TBD**) |
| **Railcar parameters** | Railcar characteristics affect unloading rate: Railcar capacity **TBD** (~80–100 m³ typical for North American tank cars; ~100,000–120,000 liters; ~92–110 MT of canola oil at 920 kg/m³), Railcar head (static head from product level in full railcar — typically 2–4m for tank car geometry; decreases as unloading progresses), Unloading time per railcar (railcar capacity ÷ flow rate per station = unloading time; typical 30–60 minutes for 100 m³ railcar at 100–200 m³/hr flow rate), Railcar turnaround time (time from railcar arrival to departure — includes unloading time + connection/disconnection time + railcar positioning time + delays; affects throughput calculation if total cycle time specified rather than just unloading time) | Obtain railcar data from PKG-07 or Employer: Railcar fleet data (typical railcar models and capacities used for canola oil transport to this facility), Railcar specifications (capacity, dimensions, outlet configuration, head pressure), If railcar data not available: use industry typical tank car data with assumption (North American tank cars typically 80–100 m³ capacity; document assumption; verify when railcar data available); Calculate unloading time (verify acceptable per ER requirements **TBD** or operations plan); Consider railcar turnaround time if specified (total cycle time may limit throughput even if unloading rate adequate — verify total cycle time acceptable for throughput) | Specification.md IN-04 (railcar data as input); PF-02 (unloading rate verification includes unloading time); Datasheet.md §Conditions (railcar capacity parameter **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain railcar data from PKG-07, Employer, or use industry typical values with assumption); Step 4a (calculate unloading time per railcar; verify acceptable; account for turnaround time if applicable) |
| **Product properties** | Canola oil properties affect flow calculations: Viscosity strongly affects flow rate and pressure drop (higher viscosity reduces flow rate, increases pressure drop; viscosity decreases significantly with temperature — e.g., 80 cSt at 20°C, 30 cSt at 40°C; viscosity-temperature curve required for accurate calculations), Density affects mass-volume conversions and pressure drop (density ~920 kg/m³ at 15°C; temperature dependent — decreases ~0.7 kg/m³ per °C), Temperature during unloading (ambient temperature for unheated operations **TBD**, or heated temperature if winterization required — heated product flows faster due to lower viscosity; affects flow rate and capacity significantly) | Obtain product data with temperature dependence: Density-temperature curve (for accurate mass-volume conversions at operating temperature), Viscosity-temperature curve (critical for flow rate calculations — viscosity can vary by factor of 2–3 over temperature range; significantly affects flow rate and pressure drop); Use appropriate temperature in calculations: Operating temperature **TBD** (from ER or operations assumptions — ambient temperature for summer operations, heated temperature for winter operations if winterization implemented), Account for temperature range (calculate flow rates at minimum temperature — worst case for viscosity — and maximum temperature; verify system performs adequately at both extremes if wide temperature range); If product data not available: use typical canola oil properties with assumption (density 920 kg/m³ at 15°C, viscosity 60–80 cSt at 20°C; document assumption; verify when product data available; note uncertainty in results due to assumed product properties) | Specification.md IN-02 (product properties input with temperature dependence); Datasheet.md §Conditions (product properties — density, viscosity, temperature parameters **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain product properties with temperature dependence; document source); Step 4a, 4b (use temperature-dependent properties in flow and pressure drop calculations; verify at operating temperature range extremes if applicable) |
| **Operating schedule** | Operating hours per year affects required throughput rate: More operating hours → lower required hourly rate (e.g., 8,000 hr/yr requires 125 MT/hr average; 6,000 hr/yr requires 167 MT/hr average — 33% higher rate for fewer operating hours), Operating schedule variations (continuous year-round operations vs. seasonal operations — harvest season may be peak period requiring higher capacity; shift patterns — 24/7 vs. day shift only vs. other patterns; downtime allowance for maintenance, railcar delays, weather delays), Design basis selection (design for average rate with margin, or design for peak rate — depends on ER requirements and operational requirements **TBD**) | Clarify operating schedule basis with Employer or from ER: Obtain operating hours per year (ER may specify; otherwise coordinate with Employer operations planning), Determine if seasonal peaks require higher capacity than annual average (verify with ER or Employer — harvest season throughput requirements **TBD**), Account for downtime (maintenance downtime, unplanned outages, railcar delays, weather delays — reasonable allowance typically 5–10% of total hours), Document operating schedule assumption clearly (critical assumption — affects required hourly rate significantly; e.g., "Assumed 8,000 operating hours per year based on 22 hr/day operation × 365 days with ~2 hr/day downtime allowance"; mark for verification with Employer) | Specification.md IN-01 (operating schedule design basis input); Datasheet.md §Conditions (operating schedule parameter **TBD**) | Procedure.md Step 2 (obtain operating schedule from ER or document assumption; justify downtime allowance); Step 4a (calculate required hourly rate from annual capacity and operating hours; verify operating schedule assumption reasonable) |

**Containment Volume Calculation Considerations:**

| Factor | Consideration | Guidance | Specification Link | Procedure Link |

| **Regulatory basis** | Containment volume requirements from environmental regulations: Applicable regulations **TBD** (Environment Canada Environmental Code of Practice for Aboveground and Underground Storage Tank Systems — Section 4 Secondary Containment; BC Spill Reporting Regulation and related environmental regulations — Ministry of Environment requirements; municipal bylaws for Fraser Surrey or Surrey, BC — local spill containment requirements), Containment volume formula or criteria (regulations typically specify: 110% of largest tank/vessel volume, or 100% of largest tank/vessel + freeboard + rainfall allowance, or other formula — verify specific requirement in applicable regulations), Worst-case scenario definition (regulations typically specify largest single container or largest credible spill scenario — verify regulatory definition; adapt for railcar unloading — typically one railcar full capacity or largest header section between isolation valves), Compliance demonstration (calculation must demonstrate compliance with regulatory formula — show calculated volume ≥ regulatory minimum; cite specific regulation and demonstrate formula satisfied) | Identify all applicable regulations (federal, provincial, municipal — multiple regulations may apply; satisfy most stringent requirement), Obtain regulatory text or guidance (purchase regulations or access online; obtain official interpretation if ambiguous — consult regulatory authority or environmental consultant), Extract containment calculation requirements from regulations (volume formula, worst-case scenario, freeboard, rainfall, drainage — specific requirements vary by jurisdiction), Apply regulatory formula to project scenario (adapt regulatory requirements for railcar unloading — regulations often written for storage tanks; apply principles to unloading facility), Demonstrate compliance clearly (calculation shows regulatory requirement, shows calculated volume, demonstrates compliance — cite regulation and show compliance statement in results summary) | Specification.md IN-05 (regulatory requirements input); PF-03 (regulatory compliance verification); §Standards (environmental regulations listed) | Procedure.md Step 2 (identify and document regulatory requirements from regulations — obtain regulations, extract containment calculation requirements); Step 4c (apply regulatory requirements; demonstrate compliance clearly with citation and compliance statement) |
| **Worst-case spill volume** | Determine largest credible spill scenario for containment sizing: Potential spill sources: One railcar full capacity (if railcar connection fails or railcar ruptures — **TBD** ~100–150 m³ per typical tank car capacity; largest single source at any station), Header section volume between isolation valves (if header rupture occurs — volume of header pipe segment; typically smaller than one railcar unless very large header or long section between isolation valves; calculate header volume from pipe size and length per DEL-10.01), Other sources **TBD** (e.g., pump rupture if sump pumps large — typically small compared to railcar; arm rupture — small volume in arm; unlikely to be controlling), Select controlling scenario (largest volume among potential sources — typically one railcar capacity is controlling for unloading facilities); Document scenario selection and justification (justify why selected scenario is worst-case; why other scenarios not controlling) | Identify all potential spill sources (railcar, header sections, equipment), Calculate volume for each source (railcar capacity **TBD** — use railcar data from PKG-07 or typical tank car capacity ~100–150 m³; header section volume calculated from pipe size per header sizing calculation and section length per DEL-10.01 layout between isolation valves), Select largest volume as worst-case (typically one full railcar capacity ~100–150 m³ is controlling — larger than header section unless very large header diameter and long section), Verify scenario selection reasonable (if railcar capacity significantly larger than header section: one railcar is appropriate worst-case; if header section larger: may need to consider header rupture as worst-case), Document selection clearly (justify worst-case scenario selection; note if conservative assumptions made — e.g., using maximum railcar capacity rather than average, or considering largest header section rather than typical section) | Specification.md PF-03 (worst-case volume determination); Datasheet.md §Construction (worst-case spill scenario identified in containment calculation) | Procedure.md Step 4c (identify potential spill sources; calculate volumes; select worst-case scenario; document selection and justification) |
| **Rainfall allowance** | If regulations require stormwater capacity in open containment: Design storm criteria **TBD** (regulations may specify design storm — e.g., 24-hour storm, 1-in-25-year return period, or other criteria; verify regulatory requirement), Rainfall intensity and duration **TBD** (obtain local rainfall data for Fraser Surrey, BC — Environment Canada climate data, municipal standards, or regulatory specifications), Rainfall volume calculation (rainfall intensity mm/hr × storm duration hr × pan area m² = rainfall volume m³; add to containment volume requirement), Verify if rainfall allowance required (some regulations require rainfall capacity for open containment; other regulations may exempt if containment covered or if drainage adequate; verify applicability to this project — open or covered containment per DEL-10.01 design **TBD**) | Verify if rainfall allowance required by applicable regulations: Review regulations for rainfall requirements (if containment open to atmosphere, rainfall capacity typically required; if covered, may be exempted), If required: obtain design storm criteria from regulation or municipal standards (Fraser Surrey or Surrey, BC stormwater management requirements **TBD**; or regulatory default if not specified — e.g., 1-in-25-year 24-hour storm), Calculate rainfall volume per criteria (obtain local rainfall data; calculate volume; add to containment requirement), If not required: document why exempted (e.g., "Rainfall allowance not required per [regulation] due to covered containment design" — coordinate with DEL-10.01 to confirm containment covered if exemption claimed) | Specification.md PF-03 (rainfall allowance if required per regulations); Datasheet.md §Construction (rainfall allowance in containment calculation if applicable) | Procedure.md Step 2 (identify if rainfall allowance required; obtain design storm criteria if applicable); Step 4c (calculate rainfall volume if required; add to containment volume; or document exemption if not required) |
| **Freeboard** | Additional capacity above design liquid level: Freeboard purpose (prevents overflow from wave action, sloshing, filling transients; provides safety margin above calculated spill volume), Freeboard requirement **TBD** (regulations may specify minimum freeboard — typical 150–300mm above design liquid level, or percentage of total depth — e.g., 10% freeboard; verify regulatory requirement), Freeboard in calculation (add freeboard to calculated spill volume + rainfall allowance — total required containment volume = spill + rainfall + freeboard; freeboard as depth dimension — e.g., 200mm freeboard above design liquid depth), Verify adequate (ensure total containment depth (liquid depth + freeboard) does not exceed practical pan depth — very deep pans may be difficult to construct or require structural support; coordinate with DEL-10.01 containment details and PKG-05 structural if deep pans) | Apply freeboard per regulatory requirement or engineering practice: Regulatory freeboard if specified (use regulatory minimum — typically 150–300mm), Engineering practice freeboard if regulation does not specify (typical 200–300mm or 10% of total depth, whichever is greater — provides reasonable safety margin), Calculate total containment depth (liquid depth from spill + rainfall volume ÷ pan area + freeboard depth = total required pan depth), Verify depth practical (typical containment pans 0.5–2.0m depth; deeper pans require structural design and may be difficult to construct; if calculated depth excessive, consider: increasing pan area to reduce depth, providing overflow provisions if freeboard exceeded, or verifying regulatory requirement interpretation — consult regulatory authority if needed) | Specification.md PF-03 (freeboard in containment volume); Datasheet.md §Construction (freeboard in containment calculation) | Procedure.md Step 4c (add freeboard per regulatory requirement or engineering practice; calculate total containment depth; verify depth practical and constructible) |
| **Drainage and sump sizing** | Containment system must have drainage and sump pump for spill recovery: Drainage time requirement **TBD** (regulations or operations requirements may specify maximum time to evacuate containment after spill — typical 4–24 hours; verify requirement), Sump volume sizing (sump must accommodate: drainage from containment pans, pump cycling between start/stop levels, high-level alarm offset above pump stop level; sump volume typically 5–20% of containment volume or per pump cycling requirements), Pump capacity sizing (sump pump flow rate to evacuate containment within required drainage time — containment volume ÷ drainage time = required minimum pump flow rate; add margin for pump degradation, reliability — typically 10–25% margin on pump capacity), Pump head (pump must overcome: sump depth, discharge piping elevation and friction losses, discharge pressure if pumping to process system or drain system — coordinate with DEL-10.01 and PKG-14 for discharge piping configuration) | Determine drainage time requirement: Obtain from regulations if specified (environmental regulations may require spill evacuation within specified time), Obtain from operations requirements if not regulated (operations may specify acceptable cleanup time), If not specified: use reasonable assumption (typical 4–24 hours; faster drainage better for environmental protection and operations recovery but requires larger pumps; document assumption and justification); Size sump for drainage requirements: Sump volume for pump cycling (allow pump to cycle at reasonable frequency — not continuous operation; typically sump volume = pump flow rate × 5–15 minutes run time between start/stop cycles), Add high-level alarm offset (alarm set above pump stop level to provide warning before overflow — typically 200–500mm or per alarm requirements); Size pump for drainage time: Pump capacity = containment volume ÷ drainage time + margin; Pump head from discharge piping analysis (elevation lift + friction losses + discharge pressure; coordinate discharge piping with DEL-10.01 Containment Details and PKG-14 if discharge to process system) | Specification.md PF-04 (drainage time, sump sizing, pump capacity requirements); Datasheet.md §Construction (sump and pump sizing in containment volume calculation) | Procedure.md Step 4c (determine drainage time requirement; size sump and pump per requirements; calculate pump head per discharge configuration; document sizing basis) |
| **Multiple spill scenarios** | Whether multiple simultaneous spills considered: Single spill scenario (one railcar spills; containment sized for one railcar — typical approach for individual containment pans per station), Multiple spill scenario (multiple railcars spill simultaneously; containment sized for multiple railcars — may be required if common containment system for multiple stations), Regulatory interpretation **TBD** (regulations typically based on single largest source; multiple simultaneous spill scenarios unusual unless specifically required; verify regulatory interpretation with authority if uncertain — especially for common containment system serving multiple stations), Individual vs. common containment trade-off (individual pans: each pan sized for one railcar spill — simpler compliance and isolation; common system: may need to address multiple spill scenario or demonstrate isolation between sections — verify regulatory requirements) | Determine regulatory requirement for spill scenarios: Single largest source typical (one railcar per regulations — largest credible single spill event), Multiple source scenarios typically not required unless specified (uncommon to require multiple simultaneous equipment failures; verify with regulatory authority if uncertain), If individual pans per station (per DEL-10.01 design **PROPOSAL**): each pan sized for one railcar spill (straightforward compliance — each pan independent), If common containment system (per DEL-10.01 design **TBD** if common system selected): clarify regulatory requirement (common system for multiple stations — does regulatory requirement consider multiple simultaneous spills, or single spill with additional capacity margin? — verify interpretation; may require engineering judgment or regulatory consultation); Document scenario selection and justification (justify single vs. multiple spill scenario; cite regulatory requirement or interpretation; note conservatism if applicable) | Specification.md PF-03 (worst-case scenario includes single vs. multiple spill consideration); Datasheet.md §Construction (spill scenario assumptions in containment calculation) | Procedure.md Step 4c (determine applicable spill scenario — single or multiple per regulatory requirement and containment configuration; document scenario and justification) |

## Trade-offs

**Design Trade-offs in Calculations (Affect Design Decisions and Calculation Approach):**

| Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Considerations | Specification Link | Recommended Approach | Decision Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Header sizing approach** | **Size for all 32 stations simultaneously:** Assume all 32 stations can operate simultaneously (conservative approach; large header; high cost; significant overcapacity under normal operations); header capacity = 32 stations × flow per station | **Size for realistic simultaneous maximum:** Assume realistic number of simultaneous operations (e.g., 8–16 stations based on operating schedule, railcar availability, operations planning; smaller header; lower cost; adequate capacity for realistic operations with margin) | **Conservative vs. economical:** All 32 stations approach very conservative (unlikely all stations operate continuously simultaneously); realistic approach adequate with margin (balance capacity and cost). **OBJ-4 (operational flexibility):** Realistic approach with margin (10–25% above realistic max) provides operational flexibility without excessive cost. **Cost impact:** Header size significantly affects cost (large diameter pipe expensive; smaller pipe lower cost); size for realistic max + margin balances cost and capacity. **TBD** — Determine realistic simultaneous operations from ER operating scenario requirements or operations planning; coordinate with Employer for operating expectations; document assumption clearly as critical sizing basis. | Specification.md PF-01 (header capacity requirement — method affects margin); Datasheet.md §Conditions (simultaneous operations parameter **TBD** — critical assumption affecting header sizing approach) | **RECOMMENDED:** Size for realistic simultaneous maximum + design margin (e.g., if realistic maximum = 12 stations, design for 12 × 1.25 = 15 stations equivalent capacity; provides 25% margin above realistic operations for flexibility and peak periods; results in economical header size while maintaining adequate capacity and operational flexibility per OBJ-4). **TBD** — Human ruling required on simultaneous operations assumption (ER may specify; otherwise coordinate with Employer operations planning for realistic operating scenario; sensitivity analysis recommended to demonstrate system robust to operating scenario variations). Document decision with rationale including operating scenario assumptions, margin justification, and cost impact consideration. Decision affects header size (major cost impact), DEL-10.01 Header Layout (pipe sizes), DEL-10.02 Header Specification (capacity requirements). | **TBD** — Awaiting ER requirements or Employer input on operating scenario; proceed with assumption if needed (document assumption; verify when data available; recalculate if assumption changes significantly) |
| **Design margin magnitude** | **Higher margin (20–25% or more):** More conservative design; larger equipment; higher cost; greater operational flexibility; more future expansion capability; more robustness to uncertainty | **Lower margin (10–15%):** More economical design; smaller equipment; lower cost; adequate for normal operations; less flexibility for peak demands or future expansion; less robustness if assumptions optimistic | **Safety/flexibility vs. cost:** Higher margin increases safety and flexibility but also cost; lower margin reduces cost but requires assumptions more accurate (less tolerance for uncertainty or variations). **OBJ-4 (operational flexibility), OBJ-8 (future expansion if applicable):** Higher margin supports flexibility and expansion; lower margin may limit operational flexibility and make future expansions more difficult (equipment undersized for increased throughput). **Uncertainty:** Higher margin appropriate if significant uncertainty in inputs (product properties, operating schedule, equipment performance — margin accommodates variations); lower margin acceptable if inputs well-defined and uncertainty low. **Industry practice:** Typical margins 10–25% for process equipment sizing (balance conservatism and economy). **TBD** — Select margin based on: uncertainty level (product data available? operating schedule defined?), operational flexibility importance (Employer preference for flexibility vs. cost), future expansion plans (OBJ-8 applicable?), cost impact (larger equipment cost vs. value of flexibility/expansion capability). | Specification.md PF-01, PF-02 (design margin requirements); Datasheet.md §Conditions (design margin parameter **TBD**) | **RECOMMENDED:** Moderate margin 15–20% typical for balance of conservatism and economy (adequate margin for operational flexibility per OBJ-4; accounts for reasonable uncertainty in inputs and assumptions; supports minor future expansion; economical compared to higher margins like 30–40%). Higher margin 20–25% if uncertainty significant (limited product data, operating schedule uncertain, equipment data preliminary) or if future expansion important (OBJ-8 applicable and Employer wants expansion capability). Lower margin 10–15% if inputs well-defined (product data confirmed, operating schedule from ER, equipment data from vendor) and economy important (budget constraints, cost-sensitive project). **TBD** — Select margin during calculation development (Step 4); coordinate with Employer for preference on conservatism vs. economy; document margin selection and justification in calculation assumptions section. | **TBD** — Select during calculation development (Procedure.md Step 4); document in assumptions with justification (uncertainty level, flexibility requirements, cost considerations, industry practice) |
| **Containment sizing (minimum regulatory vs. exceed minimum)** | **Minimum regulatory compliance:** Size containment to exactly meet regulatory minimum (100% or 110% of worst-case spill + freeboard + rainfall per regulation; no additional margin; lowest cost; meets compliance requirement) | **Exceed regulatory minimum:** Provide containment volume greater than regulatory minimum (e.g., 120–150% of worst-case spill or regulatory minimum + additional margin; higher cost; more environmental protection; risk tolerance; operational buffer for overfill scenarios) | **Cost vs. risk tolerance:** Minimum compliance lowest cost (smaller pans, less material, less structural support required); exceeding minimum increases cost but reduces environmental release risk (if spill larger than worst-case or if freeboard exceeded, additional volume provides buffer). **OBJ-7 (environmental protection):** Minimum compliance adequate for regulatory requirement (regulations designed to be adequate); exceeding minimum provides additional protection (may be valued by Employer for environmental stewardship or risk-averse culture). **Regulatory vs. operational:** Minimum meets regulatory requirement (compliance ensured); exceeding minimum provides operational benefits (larger containment accommodates errors, overfills, multiple minor spills before evacuation required). **TBD** — Coordinate with Employer: some Employers prefer minimum compliance (cost-effective), others prefer exceeding minimum (environmental stewardship, risk aversion, operational buffer). | Specification.md PF-03 (containment volume ≥ regulatory requirement — minimum or exceed); Datasheet.md §Construction (containment sizing approach — minimum vs. exceed) | **RECOMMENDED:** Meet regulatory minimum with standard freeboard (regulatory compliance ensures adequate environmental protection — regulations established based on environmental risk assessment; additional margin typically not cost-justified unless Employer specifically requests or site-specific risk factors warrant). **Optional:** Exceed minimum by 10–20% if Employer values environmental stewardship (additional protection at moderate cost increase) or if operational considerations support (larger containment provides buffer for operational variations, reduces cleanup urgency). **TBD** — Coordinate with Employer for preference on minimum compliance vs. exceeding minimum (cost vs. environmental stewardship); document approach and justification in calculation. | **RECOMMENDED** minimum compliance unless Employer specifies otherwise; coordinate preference during calculation development (Procedure.md Step 1 or Step 4c) |
| **Calculation complexity (detailed analysis vs. simplified approach)** | **Detailed hydraulic model:** Comprehensive analysis using hydraulic software (e.g., AFT Fathom, PIPENET, PIPESIM — models entire header system with all branches, fittings, valves, elevation changes; provides detailed hydraulic profile, pressure at all points, flow distribution among branches; high accuracy; significant effort to build and verify model; may be excessive for gravity flow application) | **Simplified hand calculations:** Basic analysis using standard equations and spreadsheet (Darcy-Weisbach or Manning for pipe sizing; simple mass balance for throughput; regulatory formula for containment; adequate accuracy for gravity flow application; less effort; faster execution; easier to check; transparent calculations) | **Accuracy vs. effort:** Detailed model provides higher accuracy and more comprehensive analysis but requires more effort (model building, input data, verification); simplified approach adequate accuracy for gravity flow (low pressure, not highly complex system) with less effort (faster execution, easier checking, more transparent). **Appropriateness:** Gravity flow application relatively simple (not high-pressure or highly complex); simplified approach appropriate and industry-standard (detailed model may be overkill). **Checkability:** Simplified hand calculations easier to check independently (checker can verify step-by-step; no software license or specialized knowledge required); detailed model requires checker to have software and expertise (more difficult to check comprehensively). **OBJ-9 (cost if applicable):** Simplified approach lower engineering cost (less effort); detailed model higher engineering cost (more effort, software license cost). **TBD** — Determine appropriate complexity based on: system complexity (gravity flow relatively simple), accuracy requirements (typically adequate with simplified approach for sizing), Employer expectations (if ER requires specific software or analysis approach **TBD**), project budget (detailed model may not be cost-justified for this application). | Specification.md QA-03 (appropriate methods); QA-04 (software use); Datasheet.md §Attributes (software used **TBD**) | **RECOMMENDED:** Simplified hand calculations using standard equations and spreadsheet (appropriate for gravity flow application; adequate accuracy for sizing; transparent and checkable; cost-effective engineering; industry-standard approach for this type of system). Use hydraulic software only if system complexity warrants (e.g., very large diameter header with complex branching, significant elevation changes, critical pressure drop analysis) or if Employer specifically requests detailed modeling. **TBD** — Confirm approach with discipline lead during calculation scope definition (Procedure.md Step 1); document calculation approach and rationale (why simplified approach appropriate; or why detailed model needed if model used). | **RECOMMENDED** simplified approach unless complexity or Employer requirements warrant detailed model; confirm during scope definition (Procedure.md Step 1) |

**ASSUMPTION:** All trade-off decisions requiring human ruling to be documented in calculation assumptions section with justification and rationale. Decisions affect calculation results, design sizing, costs, and compliance. Human ruling required for critical assumptions (simultaneous operations, design margins, containment sizing approach); document rationale including technical analysis, Employer coordination, industry practice, and applicable requirements.

**Conservatism Guidelines (Application of Conservative Assumptions and Margins):**

| Application | Guidance | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Throughput calculations** | Demonstrate margin over minimum requirement: Calculate throughput capacity showing ≥ 1,000,000 MT/annum + margin (typical 10–25% margin — e.g., demonstrate 1,100,000–1,250,000 MT/annum capacity); Use conservative assumptions for uncertainties: If operating schedule uncertain, use fewer operating hours (requires higher hourly rate — conservative for equipment sizing); if flow rate per station uncertain, use lower flow rate (requires more simultaneous stations — conservative for verifying 32 stations adequate) | Margin demonstrates design robustness (capacity exceeds minimum even with variations in assumptions or operating conditions); Conservative assumptions reduce risk of under-capacity (if assumptions prove optimistic, design still adequate due to conservatism); Operational flexibility (margin provides capacity for peak demands, future growth per OBJ-4, OBJ-8) |
| **Header sizing calculations** | Apply design margin to header capacity (size header for design throughput + margin — typically 10–25%; larger header provides operational flexibility and future expansion capability); Use conservative values for uncertain parameters: If product viscosity uncertain, use higher viscosity (reduces flow rate, increases pressure drop — conservative for sizing requiring larger pipe); if roughness coefficient uncertain, use higher roughness (increases friction, requires larger pipe — conservative); if simultaneous operations uncertain, use higher number (requires larger header — conservative) | Margin prevents under-capacity (ensures header adequate even if actual throughput higher than design basis or if simultaneous operations exceed design assumption); Accounts for degradation (pipe roughness may increase over time due to fouling or corrosion — margin accommodates degradation; coating roughness higher than new pipe); Operational flexibility (margin supports operational variations, peak demands, partial operations without performance issues) |
| **Containment calculations** | Meet or exceed regulatory minimum (never undersize containment — regulatory non-compliance risk and environmental release risk); Use conservative assumptions for worst-case scenario: If railcar capacity uncertain, use largest railcar (conservative for containment volume); if rainfall requirement uncertain, use higher rainfall intensity or duration (conservative for containment volume); if freeboard uncertain, use higher freeboard (conservative for safety margin) | Regulatory compliance mandatory (undersizing containment violates regulations — permit non-compliance, environmental violation, liability); Environmental protection (OBJ-7 — conservative containment sizing provides better environmental protection, reduces risk of overflow and environmental release); Risk mitigation (larger containment accommodates scenarios beyond strict worst-case — provides safety margin for unforeseen events, operational errors, multiple minor spills before evacuation) |
| **ASSUMPTION** | Design margins per project design basis (if project design basis document exists **TBD**, use specified margins; otherwise use industry practice margins — typically 10–25% for equipment sizing); margins justified in calculation assumptions section; excessive margins avoided (greater than 50% margins typically not justified unless specific project requirements warrant — excessive over-design increases cost without commensurate safety or reliability benefit) | Balanced conservatism (adequate margins for safety and reliability without excessive cost) |

**Typical Calculation Flow (Step-by-Step Guidance for Each Calculation Topic per Guidance.md — Use as Template for Procedure.md Step 4):**

**Header Pipe Sizing Calculation Flow:**
1. Determine design flow rate (from unloading rate calculation — required hourly volumetric throughput; or from simultaneous operations assumption × flow per station)
2. Select pipe material and determine roughness (carbon steel ε = 0.045mm typical for new pipe; stainless steel ε = 0.015–0.045mm; or use roughness factor per material selection and condition; higher roughness for aged/fouled pipe if applicable)
3. Determine available slope/head (slope from DEL-10.01 layout if available — use actual slopes from profile; or assume minimum slope 1:100 if preliminary and verify achievable; head from elevation difference between highest inlet and outlet per DEL-10.01 elevations)
4. Size pipe for required capacity with margin (apply gravity flow equation — Manning for open channel or Darcy-Weisbach for full pipe; iterate pipe diameter until calculated capacity ≥ design flow rate + margin; select standard pipe size equal to or larger than calculated diameter)
5. Verify velocity within acceptable range (calculate flow velocity = flow rate ÷ pipe area; verify velocity ≥ minimum for drainage and ≤ maximum to prevent erosion — typical 1.5–3 m/s for oils; adjust pipe size or slope if velocity out of range)
6. Calculate pressure drop and verify gravity flow viable (calculate total pressure drop — friction losses + fitting/valve losses + elevation changes; verify gravity head ≥ total pressure drop — ensures gravity flow without pumping; if pressure drop exceeds gravity head, increase pipe size or slope to reduce losses)
7. Confirm slope achievable with layout (verify required slope feasible with site elevations per DEL-10.01 and PKG-05; if slope not achievable, revise pipe size to achieve capacity at available slope, or revise layout to provide required slope — coordinate with DEL-10.01)
8. Document results (selected pipe size, calculated capacity, velocity, pressure drop, margin; comparison to acceptance criteria; conclusions)

**Unloading Rate / Throughput Verification Calculation Flow:**
1. Determine annual throughput requirement (1,000,000 MT/annum from decomposition §1 and OBJ-2)
2. Calculate operating hours available (obtain from ER **TBD** or assume reasonable value — e.g., 8,000 hr/yr for ~22 hr/day accounting for downtime; document assumption and justification)
3. Determine required hourly/daily rate (annual capacity ÷ operating hours = required hourly rate MT/hr; convert to volumetric rate m³/hr using product density ~920 kg/m³)
4. Calculate flow rate per station (obtain from vendor data for unloading arm, or calculate from first principles, or assume typical value — **TBD** ~50–200 m³/hr for gravity unloading; verify with DEL-10.04 when vendor data available)
5. Determine simultaneous stations needed (required hourly volumetric rate ÷ flow per station = minimum simultaneous stations for average throughput; round up to integer; add margin **TBD** % — e.g., 20% margin — for operational flexibility and peak periods)
6. Verify capacity exceeds requirement (verify required simultaneous + margin ≤ 32 available stations — demonstrates adequate station count; calculate annual throughput capacity with design assumptions — verify ≥ 1,000,000 MT/annum + margin)
7. Calculate unloading time per railcar (railcar capacity **TBD** m³ ÷ flow rate per station = unloading time; typical 30–60 minutes; verify acceptable per ER requirements or operations plan **TBD**)
8. Document results (required simultaneous operations, unloading time, annual throughput capacity with margin; comparison to 1,000,000 MT/annum requirement; conclusions demonstrating throughput achievable)

**Containment Volume Calculation Flow:**
1. Identify regulatory requirements (Environment Canada Code of Practice **TBD**, BC environmental regulations **TBD**, municipal bylaws **TBD**; obtain regulations and extract containment volume requirements — formula, scenarios, allowances)
2. Determine worst-case spill volume (identify largest single spill source — typically one railcar full capacity ~100–150 m³ or largest header section volume between isolation valves if larger; select controlling scenario; document selection and justification)
3. Add rainfall allowance if applicable (if regulations require stormwater capacity: obtain design storm criteria **TBD** — intensity, duration, return period; calculate rainfall volume = intensity × duration × pan area; add to spill volume; if regulations do not require or if containment covered, document exemption)
4. Add freeboard (minimum freeboard above design liquid level — **TBD** per regulations or engineering practice — typical 150–300mm; add to liquid depth to get total required containment depth)
5. Calculate total required containment volume (spill volume + rainfall volume + freeboard volume = total required volume; or apply regulatory formula if different from additive approach — e.g., 110% of largest source)
6. Compare to pan sizing from layout (obtain pan dimensions from DEL-10.01 Containment Details if available; calculate pan volume from dimensions; verify pan volume ≥ required volume; if individual pans: verify each pan ≥ required volume; if common system: verify total system volume ≥ required volume)
7. Verify regulatory compliance (demonstrate calculated/provided containment volume ≥ regulatory minimum; cite regulation and show compliance statement — e.g., "Containment volume = X m³ ≥ regulatory requirement Y m³ per [regulation citation]; Complies with [regulation name and section]")
8. Size sump and pump (sump volume per drainage and pump cycling requirements **TBD**; pump capacity per drainage time requirement **TBD** — e.g., 24-hour drainage requires pump flow rate ≥ containment volume ÷ 24 hr)
9. Document results (required containment volume, provided containment volume, regulatory compliance statement, sump/pump sizing; conclusions demonstrating compliance)

**Notes:**
- Conflicts may emerge when ER requirements reviewed (Procedure.md Step 2 — ER inputs and requirements identification) if ER requirements conflict with codes, regulations, or industry practice. Document conflicts in this table with proposed resolution; request human ruling.
- Calculation assumption conflicts: If different sources provide different values for same parameter (e.g., different product density values from different sources), document conflict and select conservative value with justification; or request human ruling if significant impact on results.
- Trade-offs requiring human ruling: See §Trade-offs above — simultaneous operations assumption, design margin selection, containment sizing approach (minimum vs. exceed), calculation complexity (detailed vs. simplified) all require human coordination/ruling during calculation development. Document rulings in calculation assumptions section with justification.

**Cross-Document Consistency Check (Pass 3 — Final Verification):**

| Check | Status | Verification Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Datasheet parameters appear in Specification requirements | ✓ Verified | All design basis parameters from Datasheet.md §Conditions are addressed in Specification.md input requirements (IN-01 through IN-05) and performance requirements (PF-01 through PF-03) |
| Specification requirements have rationale in Guidance | ✓ Verified | All requirement categories (FN, PF, IN, QA) have corresponding principles, considerations, and calculation guidance in this document; calculation flows provide step-by-step guidance for meeting requirements |
| Specification requirements have verification in Procedure | ✓ Verified | Verification matrix in Specification.md aligns with Procedure.md steps; all requirements traceable to procedure steps (scope definition Step 1, inputs Step 2, execution Step 4, checking Step 5) |
| Terminology consistent across documents | ✓ Verified | Consistent use across all 4 documents: "header pipe sizing" (not "header sizing" alone inconsistently), "unloading rate calculations" (not "throughput analysis" alone inconsistently — though both terms used, primary term is "unloading rate calculations"), "containment volume calculations" (not "spill containment sizing" inconsistently), "gravity flow" (consistently used), "design margin" (consistently used for overcapacity), "simultaneous operations" (consistently used for concurrent unloading stations) |
| Values consistent across documents | ✓ Verified | Key values consistent: 32 stations, 1,000,000 MT/annum throughput, 3 calculation topics (Header Sizing, Unloading Rate, Containment Volume), gravity flow operation, canola oil product, typical design margins 10–25%, typical velocity limits 1.5–3 m/s for oils |
| Calculation outputs support other deliverables | ✓ Verified | All 3 calculation topics have downstream use clearly stated: Header Sizing results used in DEL-10.01 (pipe sizes) and DEL-10.02 (performance requirements); Unloading Rate results verify OBJ-2 and inform DEL-10.02, DEL-10.04; Containment Volume results used in DEL-10.01 (pan dimensions) and demonstrate OBJ-7 compliance; all linkages documented in Datasheet.md §Construction and Specification.md §Documentation |
| Procedure prerequisites match Specification inputs | ✓ Verified | Procedure.md §Prerequisites lists upstream inputs (ER for design basis, product data for properties, DEL-10.01 for geometry, DEL-10.04 for equipment data, regulations for containment requirements) that align with Specification.md input requirements IN-01 through IN-05 |
| Objective alignment consistent | ✓ Verified | All 4 project objectives (OBJ-1, OBJ-2, OBJ-4, OBJ-7) consistently referenced: OBJ-1 for safe margins, OBJ-2 for throughput verification (primary calculation purpose), OBJ-4 for operational flexibility (margins and partial operation scenarios), OBJ-7 for environmental protection (containment volume regulatory compliance); interpretation and application consistent across all documents |
| TBD and ASSUMPTION labels consistent | ✓ Verified | All TBDs and ASSUMPTIONs consistently marked across documents; same items marked TBD (ER clauses, product properties, railcar data, simultaneous operations, margins, regulatory requirements, software used, etc.); assumptions consistently labeled (personnel qualifications, quality procedures, industry practice references, etc.) |
| Trade-offs consistent with related deliverables | ✓ Verified | Calculation trade-offs (simultaneous operations, design margins, containment sizing approach) consistent with and referenced by DEL-10.01 Guidance (gravity flow design, operational flexibility), DEL-10.02 Guidance (material selection trade-offs driven by calculation results), and this document; decisions documented for human ruling with impact on multiple deliverables noted |
