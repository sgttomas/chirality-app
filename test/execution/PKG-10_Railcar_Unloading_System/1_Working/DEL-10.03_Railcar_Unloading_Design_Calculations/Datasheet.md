**Note:** Calculations may be iterative with related deliverables: preliminary calculations size equipment → DEL-10.01 draws layout and DEL-10.04 specifies equipment → final calculations verify with actual layout and equipment data. Coordinate iterative development through project schedule and human coordination.

**Pass 3 Verification:** All references bidirectionally linked; all TBDs marked and sourced; all ASSUMPTIONs and PROPOSALs labeled; cross-references to all related PKG-10 deliverables verified; calculation inputs and methods clearly defined; downstream use of calculation results clearly stated for each calculation topic.
