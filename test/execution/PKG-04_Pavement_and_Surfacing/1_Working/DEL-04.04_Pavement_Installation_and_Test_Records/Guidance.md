# Guidance: DEL-04.04 Pavement Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This guidance clarifies how to review pavement installation and test records to ensure completeness, accuracy, traceability to DEL-04.01/04.02/04.03, and compliance with acceptance criteria, while verifying OBJ-8 Phase 2 expansion corridor enhanced documentation is complete.

## Principles

### P1: Records Are Legal Documents
Test records serve as:
- Proof of contractual compliance (demonstrates work conforms to contract requirements)
- Basis for payment (quantities installed, acceptance test results)
- Legal evidence (in case of disputes, warranty claims, or litigation)
- Long-term reference (for maintenance, rehabilitation, Phase 2 expansion)

**Rationale**: Incomplete, inaccurate, or illegible records have no legal standing. Records must be complete, accurate, legible, and properly signed to be admissible as evidence of conformance.

### P2: Test Results Must Be Traceable to Requirements
Every test result must link to:
- The requirement being verified (DEL-04.02 specification clause, DEL-04.03 calculated value)
- The design element being tested (DEL-04.01 drawing section or detail)
- The acceptance criterion (pass/fail threshold from DEL-04.02 or DEL-04.03)
- The consequence of failure (NCR process, corrective action, re-testing)

**Rationale**: Untraceable test results cannot prove conformance. Explicit linkage enables verification that all requirements were tested and all tests met acceptance criteria.

### P3: Non-Conformances Must Be Closed
Every NCR must have:
- Clear description of what requirement was not met
- Root cause determination
- Approved corrective action plan
- Verification that corrective action was effective (re-testing showing conformance)
- Closure approval by Engineer

**Rationale**: Unclosed NCRs represent unresolved quality issues. Final acceptance cannot be granted until all NCRs are closed or have approved disposition.

### P4: OBJ-8 Documentation Supports Future Expansion
Phase 2 expansion corridor records must be:
- More comprehensive than standard areas (enhanced testing frequency, additional documentation)
- Easily retrievable (indexed separately, clearly marked)
- Sufficient for Phase 2 design (material properties, as-built dimensions, construction details)

**Rationale**: OBJ-8 Future Expandability is a project objective. Insufficient Phase 2 documentation forces costly field investigation or design assumptions during Phase 2.

## Considerations

### Record Timing and Real-Time Documentation
- **Field records same-day**: Compaction test results, daily QC observations recorded same day
- **Laboratory records per standard**: Laboratory testing follows standard curing and testing schedules
- **Record compilation ongoing**: Organize and index records continuously during construction
- **Real-time NCR process**: Identify and document non-conformances immediately

### Testing Frequency Adequacy
- **Statistical confidence**: Testing frequency must provide adequate confidence
- **Risk-based approach**: Increase frequency in high-risk areas (heavy load zones, critical interfaces, OBJ-8 expansion corridors)
- **Random vs. systematic**: Balance random sampling with targeted testing

## Coordination Guidance

### Internal PKG-04 Coordination
- **DEL-04.01**: Verify test locations on drawings; verify drawing revisions referenced are current
- **DEL-04.02**: Verify acceptance criteria match specification; account for specification revisions
- **DEL-04.03**: Verify target values match calculations; account for calculation revisions

### Cross-Package Coordination
- **PKG-03**: Verify utility trench backfill compaction documented
- **PKG-05**: Verify structure-to-pavement transition testing documented
- **PKG-07**: Verify rail crossing testing documented
- **PKG-08**: Verify pavement-to-wharf interface testing documented

### Owner/Engineer Coordination
- **Record format approval**: Confirm format meets requirements
- **NCR disposition**: Obtain Engineer approval for NCRs
- **Final acceptance inspection**: Coordinate walkthrough and punch list

## Trade-offs

### Testing Frequency: Coverage vs. Cost
Use DEL-04.02 frequency as baseline; increase for high-risk areas; do not decrease below minimum without approval.

### Digital vs. Paper Records
Use format specified in contract; consider hybrid approach with paper originals and digital scans; plan for long-term format compatibility.
