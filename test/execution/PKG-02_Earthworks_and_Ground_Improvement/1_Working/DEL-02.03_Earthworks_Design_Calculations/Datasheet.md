    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Provides the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for earthworks. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: TBD (references not yet provided).

    ## Construction content

    - Cut/fill quantity calculations
- bearing capacity calculations

    **Configuration notes:**

    - TBD (details require ER volumes and design inputs).

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how the requirements will influence deliverable execution.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` capture the verification expectations for the recorded artifacts.

    ## References

    - _CONTEXT.md, `Documentation for deliverable identity and anticipated artifacts`.
    - Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-02 scope, DEL-02 entries; location TBD).
    - _REFERENCES.md is empty; Employer's Requirements volumes listed in decomposition remain pending (TBD).
