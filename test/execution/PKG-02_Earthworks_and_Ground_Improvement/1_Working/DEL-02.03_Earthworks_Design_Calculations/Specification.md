### R5: Design Basis Documentation
**Requirement:** Document design assumptions, inputs, methods, criteria, and references clearly and traceably.
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Standard engineering calculation practice; engineering rigor requirement.
- **Datasheet mapping:** Calculation format attribute; inputs, methods, outputs in calculation content.
- **Verification:** V4 (calculation check and review).
- **Note:** Traceability enables design verification and future modifications.

### R6: Document Control and Checking
**Requirement:** Include document control fields (calculation ID, title, revision, dates, preparer, checker, approver); independent check required.
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Standard D&B engineering QA/QC practice; details **TBD** pending ER requirements.
- **Datasheet mapping:** Attributes (calculation package ID, check status, revision).
- **Verification:** V4.

## Standards

**Applicable Standards:**
The following standards and codes are anticipated to govern earthworks design calculations (**ASSUMPTION** — to be confirmed from ER requirements and DEL-02.04):

- Geotechnical design standards: **TBD** — e.g., Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual, CSA standards, applicable provincial codes.
- Bearing capacity methods: **TBD** — e.g., Terzaghi, Meyerhof, or code-specified methods.
- Settlement calculation methods: **TBD** — e.g., elastic settlement, consolidation methods.
- Civil design standards: **TBD** — grading, cut/fill balance, earthwork measurement standards.
- Calculation documentation standards: **TBD** — project calculation format and checking requirements.

**Note:** Employer's Requirements volumes are referenced in decomposition but not yet provided. Standards identification is **TBD** until ER volumes and DEL-02.04 are available.

## Verification

### V1: Content Completeness
**Method:** Verify inclusion of required calculation packages (R2-R3) and documentation (R5, R6).
- **Responsible:** Design engineer (preparer) and checker.
- **Criteria:** All required calculations present with inputs, methods, outputs clearly documented; independent check complete.
- **Records:** Calculation review checklist; checker sign-off.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 4 in Procedure.md.

### V2: Scope Alignment
**Method:** Verify calculations address PKG-02 scope (grading, excavation, fill, ground improvement) per R4.
- **Responsible:** Design lead.
- **Criteria:** All scope items have corresponding design basis; no scope gaps.
- **Guidance reference:** Principles in Guidance.md regarding scope coverage and completeness.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 2 in Procedure.md.

### V3: ER Compliance
**Method:** Verify calculations align with ER design criteria and methods once Employer's Requirements volumes are available (R1).
- **Responsible:** Design lead and quality reviewer.
- **Criteria:** **TBD** — calculation methods and criteria consistent with ER.
- **Status:** Requirements not yet available; verification criteria to be established when ER volumes provided.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 1 in Procedure.md.

### V4: Calculation Accuracy and Coordination
**Method:** Independent check of calculations; verify coordination with design and construction deliverables.
- **Responsible:** Independent checker (different engineer than preparer).
- **Criteria:**
  - Calculation inputs, methods, and results are accurate and verifiable.
  - Assumptions are reasonable and documented.
  - Calculations support DEL-02.01 (Design Drawing Set) and DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification).
  - Calculation outputs (cut/fill quantities, bearing capacity) are used correctly in drawings and specifications.
  - No conflicts between calculations and design/geotechnical recommendations.
- **Guidance reference:** Principles P1-P4 in Guidance.md.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 3-4 in Procedure.md.
