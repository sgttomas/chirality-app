# Guidance: DEL-02.04 Geotechnical Reports

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Geotechnical Reports aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements, and Procedure realization. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

## Principles

- **Technical Rigor and Accuracy**: Geotechnical reports must provide reliable, defensible analysis based on sound investigation data and engineering judgment to support design decisions and regulatory approvals. **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with professional engineering standards and project risk management objectives.
- **Completeness and Clarity**: Reports shall comprehensively address subsurface conditions, design parameters, and recommendations in clear, unambiguous language suitable for review by engineers, contractors, and regulatory authorities. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard professional practice.
- **Coordination and Consistency**: Geotechnical recommendations shall align with design requirements in DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings), DEL-02.02 (Specifications), DEL-02.03 (Calculations) and provide necessary parameters for structural packages (PKG-05, PKG-06, PKG-04). Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Cross-package coordination requirement.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Reports shall satisfy jurisdictional requirements for professional engineering practice, including sealing/stamping by licensed geotechnical engineer where required. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Professional engineering standards; **TBD**: ER will specify regulatory authority.
- Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Align report content with PKG-02 earthworks scope (grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement, geotechnical works). Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

## Requirement Traceability

- R1 (Geotechnical Investigation Report content): Guidance emphasizes importance of comprehensive site characterization to reduce design uncertainty and construction risk. Investigation scope must be sufficient to address all foundation types, earthworks activities, and potential geohazards.
- R2 (Report sections and technical content): Guidance highlights need for clear organization, logical flow from data presentation to analysis to recommendations, and sufficient detail for design without excessive conservatism.
- R3 (Ground Improvement Design Report): Guidance notes that ground improvement, if required, demands specialized analysis of treatment effectiveness, cost-benefit assessment, and construction quality control measures.
- R4 (PKG-02 scope coverage): Guidance emphasizes ensuring all geotechnical aspects of grading, excavation, fill placement are addressed; gaps in coverage can lead to construction delays or unforeseen conditions claims.
- R5 (Document control): Guidance highlights importance of clear revision tracking as geotechnical understanding evolves during design development.
- R6 (Professional qualifications): Guidance stresses that report credibility and regulatory acceptance depend on qualified, licensed geotechnical engineer authorship.
- R7 (Cross-package parameters): Guidance emphasizes early coordination to provide timely geotechnical parameters for structural and pavement design schedules.
- R8 (Excavation, dewatering, compaction): Guidance highlights these are critical for construction planning, cost estimating, and means-and-methods development.

## Considerations

- **Investigation Program Adequacy**: Ensure borehole/test pit locations, depths, and testing frequency are sufficient to characterize subsurface variability across the site. **TBD**: ER will specify minimum investigation requirements; **ASSUMPTION**: Industry standards (e.g., one borehole per foundation location, minimum spacing for area characterization).
- **Seasonal and Groundwater Variability**: Consider timing of investigation relative to seasonal groundwater fluctuations; supplemental investigation may be required. **TBD**: Site-specific hydrogeologic conditions from ER.
- **Laboratory Testing Scope**: Balance standard classification testing with advanced testing (e.g., consolidation, triaxial, chemical) based on soil types, foundation loads, and design sensitivity. **ASSUMPTION**: Testing program defined by qualified geotechnical engineer.
- **Design Parameter Conservatism**: Apply appropriate factors of safety and select design parameters (bearing capacity, friction angle, cohesion) consistent with investigation quality, soil variability, and consequence of failure. **ASSUMPTION**: Professional engineering judgment per applicable codes.
- **Ground Improvement Feasibility**: If weak soils or high groundwater encountered, evaluate ground improvement options (e.g., preloading, stone columns, soil mixing) vs. deep foundations; consider cost, schedule, and constructability. **TBD**: ER may prescribe foundation approach.
- Tie Datasheet Attributes to Specification requirements (R1–R8) to ensure report content completeness. **ASSUMPTION**: Cross-document consistency ensures nothing falls through gaps.
- Environmental and regulatory constraints (e.g., contaminated soil handling, dewatering discharge permits) should be captured once references become available. **TBD** pending Employer's Requirements volumes.
- Contractor QA/QC procedures should confirm report content satisfies Specification requirements and verification steps in `Procedure.md`. **ASSUMPTION**: Typical D&B QA/QC practice.

## Trade-offs

- **Investigation Scope vs. Budget**: More extensive investigation reduces subsurface uncertainty but increases upfront cost; insufficient investigation risks costly surprises during construction. Guidance: Follow ER minimum requirements as baseline; supplement based on risk assessment and geotechnical complexity.
- **Detailed Analysis vs. Schedule**: Sophisticated numerical modeling (e.g., settlement analysis, slope stability) provides refined design but requires more time; simplified methods may suffice for low-risk conditions. Guidance: Use Specification requirements (R1–R8) and coordination needs (R7) to prioritize analysis effort where it adds most value.
- **Prescriptive vs. Performance-Based Recommendations**: Prescriptive recommendations (e.g., "compact to 95% standard Proctor") provide clear acceptance criteria; performance-based (e.g., "achieve bearing capacity of X kPa") offers contractor flexibility. Guidance: Reference Specification verification approach (V1–V3) and `Procedure.md` to balance clarity with constructability.
