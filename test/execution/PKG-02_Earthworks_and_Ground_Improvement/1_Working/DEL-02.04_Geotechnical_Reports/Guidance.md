# Guidance: DEL-02.04 Geotechnical Reports

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Geotechnical Reports aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements R1-R8, and Procedure realization.

**Deliverable Role:** Geotechnical reports establish the subsurface conditions and engineering parameters that form the foundation for earthworks design. They provide critical inputs to DEL-02.01 (Drawings), DEL-02.02 (Specification), DEL-02.03 (Calculations), and cross-package coordination (PKG-04, PKG-05, PKG-06).

## Principles

### Technical Rigor and Accuracy
**Principle:** Geotechnical reports must provide reliable, defensible analysis based on sound investigation data and engineering judgment to support design decisions and regulatory approvals.

**Rationale:** Geotechnical uncertainty is a major source of construction risk. Rigorous investigation and analysis reduce the likelihood of unforeseen conditions and costly design changes.

**Application:**
- Ensure investigation program is sufficient to characterize subsurface variability.
- Use appropriate testing methods and interpretation techniques.
- Apply engineering judgment consistent with professional standards.
- Document data quality limitations and their impact on recommendations.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with professional engineering standards and project risk management.

| Datasheet mapping | Basis of report, Author/organization |
| Procedure Step | Steps 4-7 |

### Completeness and Clarity
**Principle:** Reports shall comprehensively address subsurface conditions, design parameters, and recommendations in clear, unambiguous language suitable for review by engineers, contractors, and regulatory authorities.

**Rationale:** Incomplete or ambiguous reports lead to design gaps, construction questions, and potential disputes. Clear documentation supports efficient design development and construction execution.

**Application:**
- Follow standard report structure (executive summary, site description, investigation, analysis, recommendations).
- Present data clearly with appropriate tables, figures, and appendices.
- State conclusions and recommendations unambiguously.
- Identify limitations and areas requiring additional investigation or monitoring.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Standard professional practice.

| Datasheet mapping | Report Content sections |
| Procedure Step | Step 9 |

### Coordination and Consistency
**Principle:** Geotechnical recommendations shall align with design requirements in DEL-02.01, DEL-02.02, DEL-02.03 and provide necessary parameters for structural packages (PKG-04, PKG-05, PKG-06).

**Rationale:** Geotechnical parameters are fundamental inputs to multiple design disciplines. Inconsistencies between geotechnical recommendations and design assumptions create conflicts and rework.

**Application:**
- Coordinate investigation scope with anticipated foundation types and earthworks requirements.
- Provide parameters in format and units suitable for downstream design use.
- Communicate recommendations early to support design schedule.
- Resolve any conflicts between geotechnical recommendations and design requirements proactively.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Cross-package coordination requirement.

| Procedure Step | Steps 1, 11 |

### Regulatory Compliance
**Principle:** Reports shall satisfy jurisdictional requirements for professional engineering practice, including sealing/stamping by licensed geotechnical engineer where required.

**Rationale:** Professional engineering licensure requirements ensure competence and accountability. Non-compliant reports may not be accepted by regulatory authorities.

**Application:**
- Verify licensing requirements for BC jurisdiction.
- Ensure report is prepared under supervision of licensed geotechnical engineer.
- Include required professional seals/stamps.
- Comply with any ER-specified regulatory requirements.
- **TBD**: ER will specify regulatory authority.

## Considerations

### Investigation Program Adequacy
- Ensure borehole/test pit locations, depths, and testing frequency characterize subsurface variability.
- **TBD**: ER will specify minimum investigation requirements.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Industry standards (e.g., one borehole per foundation location, minimum spacing for area characterization).
- **Procedure reference:** Step 2.

### Seasonal and Groundwater Variability
- Consider timing of investigation relative to seasonal groundwater fluctuations.
- Supplemental investigation may be required.
- **TBD**: Site-specific hydrogeologic conditions from ER.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 4, 6.

### Laboratory Testing Scope
- Balance standard classification testing with advanced testing based on soil types, foundation loads, and design sensitivity.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Testing program defined by qualified geotechnical engineer.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 5.

### Design Parameter Conservatism
- Apply appropriate factors of safety and select design parameters consistent with investigation quality, soil variability, and consequence of failure.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Professional engineering judgment per applicable codes.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 7.

### Ground Improvement Feasibility
- If weak soils or high groundwater encountered, evaluate ground improvement options vs. deep foundations.
- Consider cost, schedule, and constructability.
- **TBD**: ER may prescribe foundation approach.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 8.

### Environmental and Regulatory Constraints
- Capture contaminated soil handling, dewatering discharge permits when references become available.
- **TBD** pending ER volumes.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 1, 3.

## Trade-offs

### Investigation Scope vs. Budget
**Trade-off:** More extensive investigation reduces subsurface uncertainty but increases upfront cost; insufficient investigation risks costly surprises during construction.

**Guidance:** Follow ER minimum requirements as baseline; supplement based on risk assessment and geotechnical complexity.

### Detailed Analysis vs. Schedule
**Trade-off:** Sophisticated numerical modeling provides refined design but requires more time; simplified methods may suffice for low-risk conditions.

**Guidance:** Use Specification requirements (R1-R8) and coordination needs (R7) to prioritize analysis effort where it adds most value.
