# Procedure: DEL-02.04 Geotechnical Reports

## Purpose

Produce Geotechnical Reports (Investigation Report and Ground Improvement Design Report if required) for PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement while satisfying Specification requirements R1-R8 and supporting Guidance principles.

**Dual-Use Note:** This procedure describes how to **produce** the geotechnical reports deliverable through investigation and engineering analysis. Field execution procedures for ground improvement construction are addressed in DEL-02.06 and DEL-02.07.

| 11 | Coordinate geotechnical parameters with structural packages (PKG-04, PKG-05, PKG-06) | R7 | Coordination | Foundation parameters, Pavement |

### Phase 4: Review and Approval

| Step | Action | Specification § | Verification | Records |

| 12 | Perform internal technical review against V1-V3; update Datasheet for any TBDs/ASSUMPTIONs requiring resolution | R1-R8 | V1, V2, V3 | Review checklist |
| 13 | Address review comments; revise report as necessary; update revision | R5 | — | Comment log |
| 14 | Obtain professional engineer seal/stamp and approvals per regulatory requirements | R6 | V3 | Seal documentation |
| 15 | Issue controlled report per D&B document control procedures; distribute to design team and coordinating packages | R5 | — | Transmittal, distribution |
