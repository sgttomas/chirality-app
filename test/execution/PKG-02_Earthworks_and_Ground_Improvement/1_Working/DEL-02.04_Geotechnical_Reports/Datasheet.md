## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Documents analysis and results for geotechnical reports required for design verification and approvals. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.04 entry (location TBD).

**Technical Context:**
- Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (ER will define site-specific geotechnical conditions, seismic criteria, groundwater levels, bearing capacity requirements).
- **ASSUMPTION**: Geotechnical investigation will be performed by qualified geotechnical engineering firm under D&B Contractor oversight.
- Coordination with DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings), DEL-02.02 (Specifications), DEL-02.03 (Calculations) to ensure design consistency.
