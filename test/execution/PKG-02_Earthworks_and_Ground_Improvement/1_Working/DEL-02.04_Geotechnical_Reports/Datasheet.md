    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Documents analysis and results for geotechnical reports required for design verification and approvals. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (references not yet provided; ER will define site-specific geotechnical conditions, seismic criteria, groundwater levels, bearing capacity requirements).
    - **ASSUMPTION**: Geotechnical investigation will be performed by qualified geotechnical engineering firm under D&B Contractor oversight.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings), DEL-02.02 (Earthworks Specifications), DEL-02.03 (Earthworks Calculations) to ensure design consistency.

    ## Report Content

    **Geotechnical Investigation Report:**
    - Executive summary and conclusions
    - Site description and investigation program
    - Subsurface conditions (soil/rock stratigraphy, groundwater)
    - Laboratory test results (classification, strength, compaction parameters)
    - Engineering analysis and design recommendations
    - Foundation design parameters
    - Excavation and slope stability considerations
    - Earthworks compaction criteria
    - Pavement subgrade recommendations

    **Ground Improvement Design Report (if applicable):**
    - Ground improvement objectives and performance criteria
    - Treatment method selection and justification
    - Design calculations and analysis
    - Construction methodology and quality control requirements
    - Monitoring and verification plan
    - Expected performance and acceptance criteria

    **Configuration notes:**

    - **TBD** (details require ER volumes and design inputs; ER will specify required geotechnical parameters, foundation loads, seismic design criteria).
    - Report format and content shall comply with professional geotechnical engineering standards and ER requirements.
    - Coordination with PKG-05 (Concrete Structures), PKG-06 (Structural Steelwork) for foundation design parameters.

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` (R1–R5) is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how report quality, technical rigor, and regulatory compliance influence deliverable execution.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` describe the process for producing, reviewing, and approving geotechnical reports.
    - Verification items in `Specification.md` (V1–V3) map to report content completeness and technical adequacy checks.

    ## References

    - _CONTEXT.md, `Documentation for deliverable identity and anticipated artifacts`.
    - Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-02 scope, DEL-02 entries; location TBD).
    - _REFERENCES.md is empty; Employer's Requirements volumes listed in decomposition remain pending (TBD).
