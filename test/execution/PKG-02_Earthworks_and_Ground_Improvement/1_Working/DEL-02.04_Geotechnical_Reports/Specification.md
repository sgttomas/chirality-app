# Specification: DEL-02.04 Geotechnical Reports

    ## Scope

    This deliverable defines the requirements for Geotechnical Reports within PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entry (location TBD).

    Package scope context includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

    Exclusions: This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

    ## Requirements

    - R1: Documents analysis and results for geotechnical reports required for design verification and approvals. Source: decomposition DEL-02 entry and _CONTEXT.md (location TBD).
- R2: Include Geotechnical investigation report. Source: _CONTEXT.md.
- R3: Include ground improvement design report. Source: _CONTEXT.md.
- R4: Address grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement, geotechnical and survey scope for PKG-02. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
- R5: Document control fields (title, revision, dates, approvals) shall be included. Source: ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control; details TBD.

    ## Related Datasheet Attributes

    - Identification and anticipated artifact data in `Datasheet.md` confirm the output that maps back to these requirements.
    - Attributes such as the drawing metadata will be filled once actual sheets are produced to ensure requirement coverage.

    ## Guidance & Procedure Alignment

    - Guidance principles (`Guidance.md`) describe how to interpret and prioritize the requirements in practice.
    - Procedure steps (`Procedure.md`) describe how verification occurs against the requirements above, ensuring traceability across documents.

    ## Standards

    - Applicable earthworks, geotechnical, and civil standards: TBD pending reference documents.
    - Employer's Requirements volumes are referenced in decomposition but not provided in _REFERENCES.md (TBD).

    ## Verification

    - V1: Verify inclusion of required artifacts and content described in the Requirements and Datasheet attributes. ASSUMPTION: document review tied to `Datasheet.md`.
    - V2: Verify alignment with PKG-02 scope. ASSUMPTION: scope compliance review referencing `Guidance.md`.
    - V3: Verify alignment with ER requirements once Employer's Requirements volumes are available.

    ## Documentation

    - Controlled Geotechnical Reports deliverable (issued revision).
    - Review comments and response log. ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control workflow.

    ## References

    - _CONTEXT.md (deliverable identity, description, anticipated artifacts).
    - Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-02 scope, DEL-02 entries; location TBD).
    - `Datasheet.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md` (cross-document alignment).
    - _REFERENCES.md indicates no references yet.
