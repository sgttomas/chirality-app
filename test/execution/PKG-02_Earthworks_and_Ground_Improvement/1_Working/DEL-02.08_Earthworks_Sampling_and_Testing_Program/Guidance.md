# Guidance: DEL-02.08 Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements (R1-R10), and Procedure realization (Steps 1-15). Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.08 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

### P1: Risk-Based Testing Approach
Focus testing effort on high-risk areas (structural foundations, critical subgrade) and materials with higher variability; reduce testing in low-risk, homogeneous areas to optimize quality verification within budget constraints.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with quality management and resource optimization |
| Specification § | R1, R3, R6, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Coverage area, Frequency Matrix table |
| Procedure Step | Steps 4-5 |

### P2: Statistical Adequacy
Testing frequency must be sufficient to characterize material properties and demonstrate consistent compliance; inadequate testing leaves uncertainty, excessive testing wastes resources without commensurate benefit.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Statistical quality control principles |
| Specification § | R3, R6, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Frequency Matrix table (items 1-3) |
| Procedure Step | Steps 4-5 |

### P3: Proactive Quality Management
Early material testing (source evaluation, trial compaction) identifies issues before mass production; real-time field testing enables immediate corrective action rather than downstream rework.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Prevention-focused quality culture |
| Specification § | R1, R2, R5, R10 |
| Datasheet mapping | Sampling Plan table, Field Testing table |
| Procedure Step | Steps 3, 8, 14 |

### P4: Standardized Methods and Independence
Use recognized test standards (ASTM, AASHTO) and qualified/accredited laboratories to ensure credible, defensible results; avoid conflicts of interest in testing.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Professional quality assurance standards |
| Specification § | R2, R4, R5, R7, R9 |
| Datasheet mapping | Testing standards attribute, Laboratory qualifications |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6-10 |

**Scope Boundary:** Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Considerations

### C1: Material Source Evaluation
Test proposed fill material sources early (borrow pits, import sources) to verify suitability before committing to large volumes; avoid costly source changes mid-construction.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: Material sources; **ASSUMPTION**: Source testing before approval |
| Specification § | R2, R4 |
| Datasheet mapping | Sampling Plan item 2 (locations), Laboratory Testing items 1-2 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 3, 6 |

### C2: Testing Frequency Optimization
Balance minimum ER frequencies with risk-based adjustments; increase in critical areas (foundations, structural fill), variable materials; maintain minimum in homogeneous low-risk areas.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: ER minimum frequencies |
| Specification § | R3, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Frequency Matrix table (items 1-4) |
| Procedure Step | Steps 4-5 |

### C3: Laboratory Selection
Qualified, accredited laboratory ensures credible results; consider proximity for turnaround time, capacity for project volume, experience with similar projects.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: ER laboratory approval requirements |
| Specification § | R4, R9 |
| Datasheet mapping | Laboratory selection attribute, Laboratory Testing item 5 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 9-10 |

### C4: Field vs. Laboratory Testing Balance
Laboratory tests (Proctor, gradation) establish acceptance criteria; field tests (density) verify production compliance; both necessary for complete QC program.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Complementary testing approach |
| Specification § | R4, R5 |
| Datasheet mapping | Laboratory Testing table, Field Testing table |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6-8 |

## Requirement Traceability

| Requirement | Guidance Section | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| R1 (Testing program approach) | P1, P2, P3 | Testing program is systematic framework for quality verification; must balance thoroughness with practicality and cost |
| R2 (Sampling plan) | P3, P4, C1 | Proper sampling techniques critical for representative test results; poor sampling invalidates testing effort |
| R3 (Frequency matrix) | P1, P2, C2, T1 | Frequency must be adequate for statistical confidence and risk management; under-testing creates gaps, over-testing wastes resources |
| R4 (Laboratory testing) | P4, C3, C4, T2 | Laboratory testing provides definitive material properties (Proctor density, gradation, strength) that field tests cannot; essential for acceptance baseline |
| R5 (Field testing) | P3, P4, C4 | Field testing provides production quality control with rapid results enabling real-time decisions; supplements laboratory testing |
| R6 (PKG-02 scope) | P1, P2 | All earthworks areas must be covered by testing program; gaps in coverage create acceptance uncertainty |
| R7 (Document control) | P4 | Testing program may evolve during construction; revision tracking essential |
| R8 (Testing frequency adequacy) | P1, P2, C2, T1 | Frequency must reflect material variability and consequence of deficiency; critical areas need more testing |
| R9 (Laboratory qualifications) | P4, C3 | Accredited laboratories ensure quality and credibility of results |
| R10 (Coordination) | P3 | Testing program must integrate with execution (DEL-02.07), record-keeping (DEL-02.06), and compaction verification (DEL-02.09) |

## Trade-offs

### T1: Testing Frequency vs. Cost
More testing increases confidence but also cost and potential schedule impacts.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Follow ER minimums as baseline; increase in critical/variable areas; optimize using risk-based approach per P1 |
| Specification § | R3, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Frequency Matrix table |
| Procedure Step | Steps 4-5 |

### T2: Laboratory Turnaround vs. Construction Pace
Standard turnaround (3-5 days) may delay decisions; expedited testing costs more.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Plan ahead for schedule-critical tests; use standard turnaround where schedule permits; establish expedited service agreement for critical situations |
| Specification § | R4 |
| Datasheet mapping | Laboratory Testing item 7 (turnaround) |
| Procedure Step | Step 7 |

### T3: Comprehensive Program vs. Schedule
Comprehensive program development takes time; abbreviated program allows faster start but may have gaps.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Use R1-R10 to define minimum content; develop before construction; update as needed during execution |
| Specification § | R1, R7 |
| Datasheet mapping | Configuration Notes |
| Procedure Step | Steps 1-11, 14 |
