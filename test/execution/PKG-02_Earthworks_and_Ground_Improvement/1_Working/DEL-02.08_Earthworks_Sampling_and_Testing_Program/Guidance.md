# Guidance: DEL-02.08 Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements, and Procedure realization. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

## Principles

- **Risk-Based Testing Approach**: Focus testing effort on high-risk areas (structural foundations, critical subgrade) and materials with higher variability; reduce testing in low-risk, homogeneous areas to optimize quality verification within budget constraints. **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with quality management and resource optimization.
- **Statistical Adequacy**: Testing frequency must be sufficient to characterize material properties and demonstrate consistent compliance; inadequate testing leaves uncertainty, excessive testing wastes resources without commensurate benefit. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Statistical quality control principles.
- **Proactive Quality Management**: Early material testing (source evaluation, trial compaction) identifies issues before mass production; real-time field testing enables immediate corrective action rather than downstream rework. **ASSUMPTION**: Prevention-focused quality culture.
- **Standardized Methods and Independence**: Use recognized test standards (ASTM, AASHTO) and qualified/accredited laboratories to ensure credible, defensible results; avoid conflicts of interest in testing. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Professional quality assurance standards.
- Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Align testing program with PKG-02 earthworks scope (fill material acceptance, compaction verification for grading/fill placement). Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

## Requirement Traceability

- R1 (Testing program approach): Guidance emphasizes testing program is systematic framework for quality verification; must balance thoroughness with practicality and cost.
- R2 (Sampling plan): Guidance highlights proper sampling techniques critical for representative test results; poor sampling invalidates testing effort.
- R3 (Frequency matrix): Guidance notes frequency must be adequate for statistical confidence and risk management; under-testing creates gaps, over-testing wastes resources.
- R4 (Laboratory testing): Guidance emphasizes laboratory testing provides definitive material properties (Proctor density, gradation, strength) that field tests cannot; essential for acceptance baseline.
- R5 (Field testing): Guidance highlights field testing provides production quality control with rapid results enabling real-time decisions; supplements laboratory testing.
- R6 (PKG-02 scope): Guidance ensures all earthworks areas covered by testing program; gaps in coverage create acceptance uncertainty.
- R7 (Document control): Guidance notes testing program may evolve during construction; revision tracking essential.
- R8 (Testing frequency adequacy): Guidance stresses frequency must reflect material variability and consequence of deficiency; critical areas need more testing.
- R9 (Laboratory qualifications): Guidance emphasizes accredited laboratories ensure quality and credibility of results.
- R10 (Coordination): Guidance highlights testing program must integrate with execution (DEL-02.07), record-keeping (DEL-02.06), and compaction verification (DEL-02.09).

## Considerations

- **Material Source Evaluation**: Test proposed fill material sources early (borrow pits, import sources) to verify suitability before committing to large volumes; avoid costly source changes mid-construction. **TBD**: Material sources; **ASSUMPTION**: Source testing before approval.
- **Testing Frequency Optimization**: Balance minimum ER frequencies with risk-based adjustments; increase in critical areas (foundations, structural fill), variable materials; maintain minimum in homogeneous low-risk areas. **TBD**: ER minimum frequencies.
- **Laboratory Selection**: Qualified, accredited laboratory ensures credible results; consider proximity for turnaround time, capacity for project volume, experience with similar projects. **TBD**: ER laboratory approval requirements.
- **Field vs. Laboratory Testing Balance**: Laboratory tests (Proctor, gradation) establish acceptance criteria; field tests (density) verify production compliance; both necessary for complete QC. **ASSUMPTION**: Complementary testing approach.
- Tie Datasheet Attributes to Specification requirements (R1–R10) to ensure program completeness. **ASSUMPTION**: Cross-document consistency.

## Trade-offs

- **Testing Frequency vs. Cost**: More testing increases confidence but also cost and potential schedule impacts; balance per R8 risk-based approach. Guidance: Follow ER minimums as baseline; increase in critical/variable areas.
- **Laboratory Turnaround vs. Construction Pace**: Standard turnaround (3-5 days) may delay decisions; expedited testing costs more. Guidance: Plan ahead for schedule-critical tests; use standard turnaround where schedule permits.
- **Detailed Program vs. Schedule**: Comprehensive program development takes time; abbreviated program allows faster start but may have gaps. Guidance: Use R1–R10 to define minimum content; develop before construction; update as needed.
