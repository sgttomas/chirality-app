    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Defines the planned approach and controls for earthworks sampling & testing program to meet ER requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: TBD (references not yet provided).

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how the requirements will influence deliverable execution.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` capture the verification expectations for the recorded artifacts.
