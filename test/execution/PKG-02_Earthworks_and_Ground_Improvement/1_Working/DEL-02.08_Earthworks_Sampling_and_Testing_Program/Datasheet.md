## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Defines the planned approach and controls for earthworks sampling and testing to ensure quality compliance with ER requirements and design specifications; provides systematic framework for material testing and acceptance. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.08 entry (location TBD).

**Environmental/Operational Context:**
- Operating/environmental details: **TBD** — pending ER volumes; ER will define testing requirements, frequency, acceptance criteria, laboratory qualifications.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Testing program developed before construction start; implemented during earthworks execution per DEL-02.06 and DEL-02.09.

**Interface Coordination:**
- DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification): Material acceptance criteria, compaction requirements.
- DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports): Soil properties, recommended compaction parameters, Proctor values.
- DEL-02.06 (Installation & Test Records): Record-keeping for test results, traceability.
- DEL-02.07 (Method Statement): Testing integration with excavation/fill execution.
- DEL-02.09 (Compaction Verification Plan): Compaction testing methodology alignment.
