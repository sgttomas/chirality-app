    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Defines the planned approach and controls for earthworks sampling and testing to ensure quality compliance with ER requirements and design specifications; provides systematic framework for material testing and acceptance. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (references not yet provided; ER will define testing requirements, frequency, acceptance criteria, laboratory qualifications).
    - **ASSUMPTION**: Testing program developed before construction start; implemented during earthworks execution per DEL-02.06 and DEL-02.09.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.02 (Specifications – acceptance criteria), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – material properties), DEL-02.06 (Installation & Test Records – record-keeping), DEL-02.07 (Method Statement – testing integration with execution), DEL-02.09 (Compaction Verification Plan – compaction testing approach).

    ## Plan Content

    **Sampling Plan:**
    - Sampling objectives and scope (material characterization, acceptance testing, quality verification)
    - Sample locations and selection criteria (systematic grid, random, judgment-based for suspect areas)
    - Sample collection procedures (sample size, collection methods, preservation, labeling per ASTM standards)
    - Chain of custody and sample handling (transportation to laboratory, storage, documentation)
    - Sample types (disturbed vs. undisturbed, bulk samples, grab samples)

    **Frequency Matrix:**
    - Test type vs. frequency table (e.g., compaction tests: one per 500 m³ or per lift; gradation tests: one per source/stockpile/1000 m³)
    - Minimum testing frequencies per ER requirements or industry standards
    - Earthworks phase-specific frequencies (subgrade preparation, structural fill, general fill, final grading)
    - Additional testing triggers (material source change, visual observations of non-conformance, failed tests requiring retesting)

    **Laboratory Testing Scope:**
    - Soil classification tests (grain size distribution/gradation, Atterberg limits, visual classification per ASTM D2487/D2488)
    - Moisture-density relationship tests (standard Proctor ASTM D698, modified Proctor ASTM D1557)
    - Strength tests (unconfined compression, triaxial, direct shear – if required for design verification)
    - Chemical tests (pH, sulfate content, organic content – if contamination or deleterious materials suspected)
    - Laboratory qualifications (accreditation, approved laboratory list from ER)
    - Test methods and standards (ASTM, AASHTO, or equivalent per ER specifications)
    - Turnaround time requirements (standard vs. expedited for schedule-critical tests)

    **Field Testing Scope:**
    - In-situ density tests (nuclear density gauge ASTM D6938, sand cone ASTM D1556, rubber balloon ASTM D2167)
    - Field moisture content tests (nuclear gauge, oven-dry, microwave, calcium carbide)
    - Proof rolling (equipment, procedures, observations, acceptance criteria)
    - Visual inspections (subgrade conditions, material placement quality, segregation detection)
    - Field testing personnel qualifications (trained, certified technicians)
    - Field testing equipment (calibration requirements, maintenance, records)

    **Configuration notes:**

    - **TBD** (details require ER volumes and design inputs; ER will specify minimum testing frequencies, acceptance criteria, approved test methods/standards, laboratory qualification requirements).
    - Testing program shall balance quality assurance with construction schedule and cost; excessive testing delays production, insufficient testing leaves quality uncertainty.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.06 for record documentation and DEL-02.09 for compaction verification methodology.
    - Testing program may require updates during construction if material sources change, unusual conditions encountered, or ER/design revisions issued.

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` (R1–R10) is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how risk-based testing, statistical adequacy, and proactive quality management influence testing program effectiveness.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` describe the process for developing testing plan, defining frequencies, selecting laboratory, obtaining approvals, and implementing program during construction.
    - Verification items in `Specification.md` (V1–V3) map to testing program completeness checks, technical adequacy review, and ER compliance verification.
