# Procedure: DEL-02.08 Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program

    ## Purpose

    Produce the Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program required for PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement while satisfying Specification requirements and supporting Guidance principles. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

    ## Prerequisites

    - **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).
    - **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements volumes and relevant site data are required but not provided in _REFERENCES.md (TBD).
    - **Inputs:** PKG-02 scope for earthworks and ground improvement. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

    ## Steps

1. Review ER testing requirements, DEL-02.02 (Specifications – acceptance criteria), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – material properties/compaction requirements) to understand testing scope and criteria. **TBD** until ER provided. Maps to R1, R3, R6, R8, R9.
2. Develop sampling plan per `Datasheet.md`: sampling objectives, locations, collection procedures, chain of custody, sample types per ASTM standards. Maps to R2. Reference `Guidance.md` Material Source Evaluation.
3. Develop frequency matrix per `Datasheet.md`: test types, minimum frequencies per ER, phase-specific frequencies, triggers. Maps to R3, R6, R8. Reference `Guidance.md` Risk-Based Testing and Statistical Adequacy.
4. Define laboratory testing scope per `Datasheet.md`: classification, Proctor, strength/chemical tests if required, test standards, laboratory qualifications, turnaround times. Maps to R4, R9. **TBD**: ER laboratory approval requirements.
5. Define field testing scope per `Datasheet.md`: density tests, moisture tests, proof rolling, inspections, personnel qualifications, equipment calibration. Maps to R5.
6. Select qualified laboratory; obtain ER approval if required. Maps to R9. **TBD**: ER laboratory approval process.
7. Prepare testing program document per R7 with document control elements. Coordinate with DEL-02.06, DEL-02.07, DEL-02.09 per R10.
8. Perform verification per V1–V3; obtain internal QA/QC approval and ER approval if required. Issue controlled program. Maps to R1, R7.

    ## Verification

    - **V1 Check (R1, R2, R4, R5, R7, R9)**: Verify program includes sampling plan, lab testing scope, field testing scope, document control per `Datasheet.md` Plan Content and R1–R10. Verify test methods reference standards; verify laboratory qualifications documented. Records: Review checklist, approval signatures.
    - **V2 Check (R3, R6, R8, R10)**: Verify frequency matrix covers PKG-02 scope with statistically adequate frequencies meeting ER minimums; verify coordination with DEL-02.06/07/09. Records: Frequency compliance matrix, coordination meeting minutes.
    - **V3 Check (R1, R3, R8, R9)**: Verify ER compliance (minimum frequencies, laboratory approval, test standards) once ER available. Records: ER compliance matrix, laboratory approval documentation.

    ## Records

    - Issued Earthworks Sampling & Testing Program (controlled revisions).
    - Review comments, approvals, and response log. ASSUMPTION: standard document control practice.
