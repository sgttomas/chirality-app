## Standards

**Applicable Standards:**
The following standards are anticipated to govern earthworks technical specifications (**ASSUMPTION** — to be confirmed from ER requirements):

- Earthworks and compaction standards: **TBD** — e.g., ASTM D698/D1557 (Proctor compaction), ASTM D2922 (nuclear density).
- Geotechnical testing standards: **TBD** — e.g., ASTM soil classification and testing standards.
- Geotextile standards: **TBD** — e.g., ASTM D4533 (tensile strength), ASTM D4491 (permeability).
- Material specifications: **TBD** — gradation limits, Atterberg limits, CBR, etc.
- Canadian or local standards if applicable: **TBD** — e.g., CSA standards, BC provincial standards.

**Note:** Employer's Requirements volumes are referenced in decomposition but not yet provided in _REFERENCES.md. Standards identification is **TBD** until ER volumes are available.

## Verification

### V1: Content Completeness
**Method:** Verify inclusion of required specification sections (R2-R4) and document control fields (R6) per Datasheet attributes.
- **Responsible:** Specification author and quality reviewer.
- **Criteria:** All anticipated artifacts (earthworks, ground improvement, geotextile specifications) present with complete sections (scope, materials, execution, quality, testing).
- **Records:** Review checklist; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard specification review process.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 4 in Procedure.md.

### V2: Scope Alignment
**Method:** Verify specification content addresses PKG-02 scope (grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement) per R5.
- **Responsible:** Design lead and specification author.
- **Criteria:** All PKG-02 scope items have corresponding specification requirements; no scope gaps.
- **Guidance reference:** Principles in Guidance.md regarding scope coverage and completeness.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 2 in Procedure.md.

### V3: ER Compliance
**Method:** Verify alignment with ER performance, material, and workmanship requirements once Employer's Requirements volumes are available (R1).
- **Responsible:** Design lead and quality reviewer.
- **Criteria:** **TBD** — specification requirements consistent with ER; no conflicts.
- **Status:** Requirements not yet available; verification criteria to be established when ER volumes provided.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 1-2 in Procedure.md.

### V4: Design and Construction Coordination
**Method:** Verify specification is coordinated with design and construction deliverables.
- **Responsible:** Specification author and design coordinator.
- **Criteria:**
  - Specification requirements support design shown in DEL-02.01 (Design Drawing Set).
  - Performance criteria align with DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations) and DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports).
  - Execution requirements enable DEL-02.07 (Method Statement) field procedures.
  - Quality requirements support DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program) verification.
- **Guidance reference:** Principle P3 (Multi-Deliverable Coordination) in Guidance.md.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 3 in Procedure.md.
