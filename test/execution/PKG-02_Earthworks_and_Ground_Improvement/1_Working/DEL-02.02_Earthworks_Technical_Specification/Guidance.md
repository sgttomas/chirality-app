# Guidance: DEL-02.02 Earthworks Technical Specification

## Purpose

Provide specification authoring principles and practical considerations to ensure the Earthworks Technical Specification achieves completeness, enforceability, and constructability while satisfying PKG-02 objectives and Specification requirements R1-R6.

**Deliverable Role:** This technical specification defines the performance, material, and workmanship requirements that govern earthworks execution in the field. It forms the quality and acceptance framework for field work per DEL-02.07 (Method Statement) and quality verification per DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program).

## Principles

### P1: Performance-Based Requirements with Measurable Criteria
**Principle:** Specification requirements should define performance outcomes and acceptance criteria rather than prescribing methods, except where method control is essential for quality or safety.

**Rationale:** Performance-based specifications allow Contractor flexibility in means and methods while ensuring quality outcomes. However, critical activities (e.g., compaction near structures, ground improvement verification) may require prescriptive methods.

**Application:**
- Define compaction requirements by target density (e.g., 95% Standard Proctor) rather than number of roller passes.
- Specify material properties (gradation, plasticity, strength) rather than specific material sources.
- Allow Contractor to propose ground improvement methods that meet performance criteria (bearing capacity, settlement limits).
- Prescribe methods only where performance cannot be directly verified or where method affects safety/quality.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with design-build contracting philosophy and project risk allocation.

### P2: Scope Clarity and Interface Management
**Principle:** Clearly define the extent of earthworks specification coverage and interface requirements with Employer-provided scope and adjacent packages.

**Rationale:** Decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus clarifies that this decomposition covers Contractor scope only, with Employer-responsible items excluded except for interface connections. Specification must reflect these boundaries to prevent scope disputes.

**Application:**
- Clearly state specification applicability: Contractor earthworks scope only (grading, excavation, fill, ground improvement per PKG-02).
- Specify interface requirements where Contractor earthworks meet existing terminal infrastructure or Employer-provided items.
- Coordinate specification limits with adjacent packages (e.g., subgrade preparation interfaces with PKG-04 pavements, excavation interfaces with PKG-03 underground utilities).
- Note exclusions explicitly (Employer permits, pre-existing conditions outside Contractor scope).

| Procedure Step | Step 2 |

### P3: Multi-Deliverable Coordination
**Principle:** Ensure specification requirements are consistent with design drawings, calculations, geotechnical recommendations, and construction execution plans.

**Rationale:** Technical specifications exist within a web of interdependent deliverables. Inconsistencies between specification, design drawings, and geotechnical reports create field confusion, rework, and claims.

**Application:**
- Coordinate earthworks specification requirements (R2) with grading and cut/fill details shown in DEL-02.01 (Design Drawing Set).
- Coordinate ground improvement specification (R3) with treatment methods and acceptance criteria from DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports).
- Coordinate geotextile specification (R4) with geotechnical design recommendations and drawing details.
- Ensure compaction and material requirements enable execution per DEL-02.07 (Method Statement).
- Ensure testing and acceptance criteria support DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program) and DEL-02.09 (Compaction Verification Plan).
- **ASSUMPTION**: Coordination typically managed through design review and issue cycle.

| Datasheet mapping | All Specification Content sections |
| Procedure Step | Steps 1, 3, 4.4 |

### P4: Verifiable and Testable Requirements
**Principle:** All specification requirements must be verifiable through inspection, testing, or measurement. Avoid unenforceable or subjective requirements.

**Rationale:** Specifications form the basis for quality acceptance. Requirements that cannot be objectively verified lead to disputes and inconsistent quality outcomes.

**Application:**
- Specify measurable acceptance criteria (density, moisture content, bearing capacity, gradation limits, strength).
- Reference standard test methods (e.g., ASTM, CSA) for verification.
- Define testing frequency and sampling locations.
- Avoid subjective terms like "adequate," "suitable," "as directed" without defining objective criteria.
- Link specification requirements to verification procedures in DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program).
- **TBD**: Specific test methods and acceptance criteria pending ER requirements and DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports).

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Specification mapping | R1, R2, R3, R4; enables V1, V4 |
| Datasheet mapping | Performance Requirements tables |
| Procedure Step | Steps 3, 4.5 |

### P5: Standard Reference and Compliance
**Principle:** Reference applicable standards and codes clearly; adapt or supplement standards as needed for project-specific requirements.

**Rationale:** Standards provide established methods and criteria, reducing specification authoring effort and improving industry consistency. However, project-specific conditions may require supplemental requirements.

**Application:**
- Identify and reference governing standards (earthworks, geotechnical testing, geotextiles).
- Cite specific standard sections and test methods where applicable (e.g., "compaction per ASTM D1557").
- Note any project-specific deviations or supplements to standards.
- Confirm standard editions and applicability with ER requirements.
- **TBD**: Specific standards pending ER requirements.

## Considerations

### Specification Development Considerations

1. **Input Data and Design Basis:**
   - Confirm geotechnical investigation results and recommendations from DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports).
   - Review design calculations from DEL-02.03 for performance criteria (bearing capacity, settlement limits, fill volumes).
   - Extract design parameters from DEL-02.01 (Design Drawing Set) (finish grades, layer thicknesses, improvement zones).
   - Identify ER performance, material, and workmanship requirements (**TBD** pending ER volumes).
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 1.

2. **Material Availability and Suitability:**
   - Identify potential borrow sources and imported fill materials.
   - Specify material testing requirements to verify suitability.
   - Consider on-site material reuse where geotechnically acceptable.
   - Address material variability and quality control.
   - **TBD**: Material sources and properties pending ER and site investigation.
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 3.1.

3. **Constructability and Execution:**
   - Consider equipment access, working space, and staging areas.
   - Specify lift thickness and compaction requirements achievable with standard equipment.
   - Address weather limitations (moisture control, freeze-thaw, precipitation).
   - Coordinate with DEL-02.07 (Method Statement) for execution procedures.
   - **ASSUMPTION**: Contractor develops detailed execution approach in Method Statement.
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 3.

4. **Environmental and Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Address erosion and sediment control requirements.
   - Specify dust control and noise mitigation measures if required.
   - Comply with environmental permits and regulatory constraints.
   - **TBD**: Specific environmental requirements pending ER and permit documentation.
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 1.1.

### QA/QC Considerations

1. **Cross-Document Verification:**
   - Confirm specification requirements align with design drawings (DEL-02.01), calculations (DEL-02.03), and geotechnical reports (DEL-02.04).
   - Verify consistency of compaction, material, and testing requirements across all specification sections.
   - Check terminology consistency across all four documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure).
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 4.6.

2. **Review Workflow:**
   - Internal specification review for completeness (R2-R4), enforceability (P4), and coordination (P3).
   - Geotechnical review for ground improvement and material requirements.
   - Construction review for constructability and method feasibility.
   - Employer review and approval per R6 document control requirements.
   - **ASSUMPTION**: Standard D&B QA/QC workflow applies.
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 4.

3. **Revision Management:**
   - Track specification revisions per R6 document control.
   - Coordinate specification changes with dependent deliverables (drawings, method statements, testing programs).
   - Maintain traceability between specification requirements and field verification records.
   - **Procedure reference:** Step 5.

## Trade-offs

### Performance-Based vs. Prescriptive Requirements
**Trade-off:** Performance-based specifications provide Contractor flexibility and encourage innovation, but require robust verification. Prescriptive specifications provide more certainty but may limit efficient methods.

**Guidance:**
- Use performance-based requirements where outcomes are measurable and verification is practical (compaction density, material strength, bearing capacity).
- Use prescriptive requirements where method directly affects quality or safety and outcomes are difficult to verify (e.g., ground improvement installation sequences, geotextile overlap).
- Consider hybrid approach: specify performance criteria with prescriptive method examples.
- Align approach with DEL-02.07 (Method Statement) — if Contractor develops detailed methods, specification can be more performance-based.
- **TBD**: ER may specify required approach or balance.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle reference | P1 (Performance-Based) |
| Specification mapping | R1, R2, R3, R4 |
| Procedure Step | Step 3 |

### Specification Detail Level
**Trade-off:** More specification detail reduces ambiguity but increases authoring effort and revision risk. Less detail provides flexibility but may create field disputes.

**Guidance:**
- Provide enough detail to define quality requirements and acceptance criteria clearly.
- Avoid unnecessary detail that prescribes Contractor means and methods beyond quality/safety needs.
- Use referenced standards to reduce custom specification text where applicable.
- Focus detail on critical or high-risk activities (ground improvement, compaction near structures, interface conditions).
- **ASSUMPTION**: Design-build contracts favor less prescriptive detail where performance criteria are clear.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle reference | P1 (Performance-Based), P4 (Verifiable) |
| Specification mapping | R1 |
| Procedure Step | Step 3 |

### Standard Compliance vs. Project-Specific Requirements
**Trade-off:** Strict standard compliance improves consistency and reduces authoring effort. Project-specific requirements address unique conditions but require custom verification procedures.

**Guidance:**
- Start with applicable standards (ASTM, CSA, etc.) as baseline.
- Supplement standards with project-specific requirements only where site conditions, performance criteria, or ER requirements necessitate.
- Clearly identify deviations from or supplements to standards.
- Ensure project-specific requirements have corresponding verification procedures in DEL-02.08.
- **TBD**: Standard requirements and deviations pending ER.

| Specification mapping | Standards section |
| Procedure Step | Steps 1.5, 3.4 |
