## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for earthworks per ER requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.02 entry (location TBD).

**Technical Context:**
- Specification must support execution per DEL-02.07 (Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement).
- Specification must align with design shown in DEL-02.01 (Design Drawing Set) and DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations).
- Performance criteria: **TBD** — pending ER requirements and DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports).
- Material sources and properties: **TBD** — pending ER requirements.
- Environmental/regulatory requirements: **TBD** — pending ER requirements and permit documentation.

## Specification Content (Anticipated Artifacts mapped to Requirements)

The following specification sections are anticipated, mapped to Specification requirements:

### 1. Earthworks Specification (R2)
**Scope:** General earthworks including site grading, excavation, and fill placement.

**Content (typical sections):**
- Materials: Fill materials, borrow sources, material testing requirements
- Execution: Excavation methods, fill placement, compaction requirements, lift thickness
- Quality: Acceptance criteria, testing frequency, nonconformance procedures
- **TBD** — pending ER requirements and DEL-02.04 geotechnical recommendations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Compaction: **TBD** — typically 95% Standard Proctor for structural fills; **ASSUMPTION**
- Material gradation: **TBD** — per geotechnical design
- Moisture content: **TBD** — per material type and compaction method

### 2. Ground Improvement Specification (R3)
**Scope:** Ground improvement methods and acceptance criteria per DEL-02.04 geotechnical design.

**Content (typical sections):**
- Methods: Dynamic compaction, surcharge, geotextile-reinforced fills, stone columns, etc. (**TBD** per design)
- Materials: Stone, geotextiles, drainage materials
- Execution: Treatment patterns, depths, verification testing
- Quality: Post-treatment verification, acceptance criteria
- **TBD** — pending DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports) and ER requirements

**Performance Requirements:**
- Target bearing capacity: **TBD** — per DEL-02.04 geotechnical design
- Settlement limits: **TBD** — per design criteria
- Treatment uniformity: **TBD** — per method and acceptance criteria

### 3. Geotextile Specification (R4)
**Scope:** Geotextile materials for ground improvement, separation, and reinforcement.

**Content (typical sections):**
- Material properties: Strength, permeability, durability, UV resistance
- Types: Woven vs. non-woven, separation vs. reinforcement vs. drainage
- Installation: Overlap, anchorage, damage protection
- Quality: Testing, certification, acceptance
- **TBD** — pending DEL-02.04 geotechnical design and ER requirements

**Performance Requirements:**
- Tensile strength: **TBD** — per geotechnical design and application
- Permeability: **TBD** — per drainage requirements
- Survivability: **TBD** — per installation conditions and construction loads

**Configuration Notes:**
- All specification content shall be coordinated with DEL-02.01 (Design Drawing Set), DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations), and DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports).
- Specifications to support field execution per DEL-02.07 (Method Statement) and quality verification per DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program).
- Details require ER volumes and design inputs (currently **TBD**).

## Cross-Document Alignment

- **Specification.md:** Requirements R1-R6 define the mandatory content areas (earthworks, ground improvement, geotextiles) and scope coverage.
- **Guidance.md:** Provides principles for performance-based vs. prescriptive specifications, coordination with design and construction deliverables.
- **Procedure.md:** Defines the production workflow and verification steps (Steps 1-5) to ensure specification completeness against R1-R6.
