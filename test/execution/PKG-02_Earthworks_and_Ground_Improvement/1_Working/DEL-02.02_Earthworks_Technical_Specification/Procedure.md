# Procedure: DEL-02.02 Earthworks Technical Specification

## Purpose

Define the production workflow for the Earthworks Technical Specification to ensure the deliverable satisfies Specification requirements R1-R6, implements Guidance principles P1-P5, and supports PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement objectives.

**Dual-Use Note:** This procedure describes how to **produce** the technical specification deliverable. It does not describe field execution procedures (see DEL-02.07 Earthworks Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement for field procedures).

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
**Coordination status:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).

**Key coordination interfaces:**
- DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Design Drawing Set): Provides graphical representation of earthworks design; specification must support design intent shown in drawings.
- DEL-02.03 (Earthworks Design Calculations): Provides design basis, performance criteria, and material quantities; specification must align with calculation assumptions.
- DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports): Provides ground conditions, bearing capacity, settlement criteria, and ground improvement recommendations; specification requirements must be based on geotechnical design.
- DEL-02.07 (Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement): Will implement specification requirements in field; specification must be executable.
- DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program): Will verify compliance with specification requirements; specification must have testable acceptance criteria.
