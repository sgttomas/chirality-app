# Procedure: DEL-02.02 Earthworks Technical Specification

## Purpose

Define the production workflow for the Earthworks Technical Specification to ensure the deliverable satisfies Specification requirements R1-R6, implements Guidance principles P1-P5, and supports PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement objectives.

**Dual-Use Note:** This procedure describes how to **produce** the technical specification deliverable. It does not describe field execution procedures (see DEL-02.07 Earthworks Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement for field procedures).
