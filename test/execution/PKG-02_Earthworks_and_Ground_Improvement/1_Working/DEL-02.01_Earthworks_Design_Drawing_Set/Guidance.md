# Guidance: DEL-02.01 Earthworks Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Provide design principles and practical considerations to ensure the Earthworks Design Drawing Set achieves clarity, constructability, and regulatory compliance while satisfying PKG-02 objectives and Specification requirements R1-R7.

**Deliverable Role:** This drawing set translates earthworks design intent into constructible arrangements that enable field execution and verification per DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification) and DEL-02.07 (Method Statement).

Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.01 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

### P1: Clarity and Constructability
**Principle:** Drawing detail and presentation should prioritize field usability and construction sequencing.

**Rationale:** Design drawings are the primary field reference for earthworks contractors. Ambiguity in grading, cut/fill limits, or ground improvement zones creates rework risk and safety concerns.

**Application:**
- Use clear line weights, hatching, and annotation standards to distinguish existing vs. proposed conditions.
- Show construction limits, phasing, and access routes where applicable.
- Coordinate section locations with plan views for ease of reference.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with project safety and quality objectives.

**Specification mapping:** Supports R1 (design definition), R2-R5 (drawing content), R6 (scope coverage).

### P2: Interface Management
**Principle:** Define Contractor scope boundaries and interface connections explicitly to prevent scope creep or gaps.

**Rationale:** Decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus clarifies that this decomposition covers Contractor scope only, with Employer-responsible items excluded except for interface connections.

**Application:**
- Clearly annotate earthworks limits where they interface with Employer-provided infrastructure or out-of-scope areas.
- Show connection details where Contractor earthworks meet existing terminal infrastructure.
- Note interfaces with other packages (e.g., underground utilities in PKG-03, pavements in PKG-04).

**Source:** Decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

**Specification mapping:** Supports R1 (design definition), R6 (scope coverage).

### P3: Multi-Deliverable Coordination
**Principle:** Ensure earthworks drawings align with related deliverables in PKG-02 and adjacent packages.

**Rationale:** Earthworks design drawings must be consistent with calculations, specifications, geotechnical reports, and survey data to prevent construction conflicts.

**Application:**
- Coordinate cut/fill quantities with DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations).
- Coordinate ground improvement zones and methods with DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports) and DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification).
- Coordinate finish grades and benchmarks with DEL-02.05 (Survey Reports).
- Coordinate drainage slopes with PKG-03 (Underground Utilities & Drainage).
- **ASSUMPTION**: Coordination typically managed through design review and issue cycle.

**Specification mapping:** Supports R1, R3, R4, R6.

### P4: Design Basis Documentation
**Principle:** Reference design assumptions, criteria, and source documents clearly in drawing notes and title blocks.

**Rationale:** Drawings should be traceable to their design basis for verification and future modification.

**Application:**
- Include general notes referencing applicable standards, ER requirements, and design criteria.
- Reference geotechnical report recommendations in ground improvement details.
- Note survey datum and coordinate system per DEL-02.05.
- **TBD**: Specific ER requirements and design criteria pending reference materials.

**Specification mapping:** Supports R1, R7 (document control).

## Considerations

### Design Phase Considerations

1. **Input Data Quality:**
   - Verify topographic survey accuracy and currency (DEL-02.05).
   - Confirm geotechnical investigation coverage and depth (DEL-02.04).
   - Identify design criteria and performance requirements from ER (**TBD** pending ER volumes).

2. **Regulatory and Environmental Constraints:**
   - Identify permit requirements affecting earthworks scope and limits.
   - Consider environmental protection measures (erosion control, sediment management).
   - Address terminal operational continuity constraints.
   - **TBD**: Specific constraints pending ER requirements and permit documentation.

3. **Constructability and Sequencing:**
   - Consider equipment access and mobilization routes.
   - Identify phasing to maintain terminal operations during construction.
   - Coordinate temporary works requirements (haul roads, stockpile areas, dewatering).
   - **ASSUMPTION**: Contractor to develop detailed construction sequencing in DEL-02.07 (Method Statement).

### QA/QC Considerations

1. **Cross-Document Verification:**
   - Confirm drawing content matches Datasheet attributes and Specification requirements.
   - Verify quantities and dimensions align with DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations).
   - Check terminology consistency across all four documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure).

2. **Review Workflow:**
   - Internal design review against R1-R7 and V1-V3 (Specification verification items).
   - Coordination review with adjacent packages (PKG-03, PKG-04, etc.).
   - Employer review and approval per R7 document control requirements.
   - **ASSUMPTION**: Standard D&B QA/QC workflow applies.

3. **Revision Management:**
   - Track drawing revisions per R7 document control.
   - Maintain revision history and response to review comments.
   - Coordinate revision impacts with dependent deliverables.

## Trade-offs

### Detail Level vs. Schedule
**Trade-off:** More drawing detail improves constructability but increases production and revision effort.

**Guidance:** Use Specification requirements (R1-R7) and verification items (V1-V3) to define minimum necessary detail. Avoid unnecessary detail that doesn't support construction or verification. Balance is typically project-controls-driven.

**Procedure coordination:** Step 3 in Procedure.md addresses deliverable content development; use Specification as the completeness gate.

### Prescriptive vs. Performance-Based
**Trade-off:** Prescriptive drawings provide more construction certainty but may limit Contractor means and methods flexibility. Performance-based drawings allow flexibility but require more robust quality verification.

**Guidance:**
- Use prescriptive details where design intent is critical (e.g., ground improvement zones, finish grades).
- Use performance-based details where Contractor means and methods flexibility is appropriate (e.g., compaction methods, sequencing).
- Align approach with DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification) and DEL-02.07 (Method Statement) expectations.
- **TBD**: ER may specify preferred approach.

**Procedure coordination:** Steps 2-3 in Procedure.md address scope confirmation and content development where this balance is applied.

### Drawing Format and Standards
**Trade-off:** Consistency with Contractor standards improves efficiency; consistency with Employer standards improves integration with existing terminal documentation.

**Guidance:**
- Confirm CAD standards, sheet sizes, and drawing numbering system requirements from ER.
- If ER does not specify, use Contractor standards and document choice in drawing general notes.
- **TBD**: Pending ER requirements.

**Specification reference:** R7 addresses document control; Datasheet attributes capture drawing format decisions.

## Examples

**Note:** Specific examples require ER requirements and design inputs. The following are typical examples for this deliverable type:

1. **Grading Plan Example (R2):**
   - Plan view showing existing and proposed contours, finish grade elevations at grid intersections, drainage slopes, and grading limits.
   - **TBD**: Specific grading arrangement pending design.

2. **Ground Improvement Layout Example (R4):**
   - Plan view showing treatment zones (e.g., dynamic compaction areas, surcharge zones), grid spacing, and treatment depths.
   - Detail references to DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports) and DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification) for methods and acceptance criteria.
   - **TBD**: Specific ground improvement design pending DEL-02.04.

3. **Section Example (R5):**
   - Cross-section showing existing grade, proposed grade, cut/fill depths, ground improvement extents, fill layer thicknesses, and material specifications.
   - **TBD**: Specific section details pending design.

## Procedure Coordination

Steps in Procedure.md implement the verification expectations and design principles outlined above:

- **Step 1:** Input compilation addresses Considerations (Input Data Quality).
- **Step 2:** Scope confirmation addresses Principles P2 (Interface Management) and R6.
- **Step 3:** Content development addresses Principles P1 (Clarity), P3 (Coordination), P4 (Design Basis).
- **Step 4:** Internal checks address QA/QC Considerations and verification V1-V3.
- **Step 5:** Issuance addresses R7 (Document Control).
