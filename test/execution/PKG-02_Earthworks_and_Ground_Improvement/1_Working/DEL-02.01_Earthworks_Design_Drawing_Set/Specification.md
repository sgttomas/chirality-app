# Specification: DEL-02.01 Earthworks Design Drawing Set

## Scope

This deliverable defines the requirements for the Earthworks Design Drawing Set within PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.01 entry (location TBD).

**Included:**
- Grading plans showing site grading arrangement and finish grades
- Cut/fill plans showing excavation and fill placement zones
- Ground improvement layout showing treatment zones and methods
- Sections showing existing and proposed conditions
- All drawing content necessary to define earthworks design per PKG-02 scope

**Package Context:**
Package scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Excluded:**
This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Standards

**Applicable Standards:**
- Earthworks and grading standards: **TBD** — pending ER requirements.
- Geotechnical design standards: **TBD** — pending ER requirements.
- CAD and drawing standards: **TBD** — pending ER requirements or Contractor standards.
- Civil design standards: **TBD** — pending ER requirements.

**Note:** Employer's Requirements volumes are referenced in decomposition but not yet provided in _REFERENCES.md. Standards identification is **TBD** until ER volumes are available.

## Verification

### V1: Content Completeness
**Method:** Verify inclusion of required artifacts (R2-R5) and document control fields (R7) per Datasheet attributes.
- **Responsible:** Design reviewer.
- **Criteria:** All anticipated artifacts present; drawing list matches Datasheet sheet list.
- **Records:** Review checklist; **ASSUMPTION**: Standard design review process.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 4 in Procedure.md.

### V2: Scope Alignment
**Method:** Verify drawing content addresses PKG-02 scope (grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement) per R6.
- **Responsible:** Design lead.
- **Criteria:** All PKG-02 scope items represented in drawing set.
- **Guidance reference:** Principles in Guidance.md regarding scope coverage.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 2 in Procedure.md.

### V3: ER Compliance
**Method:** Verify alignment with ER requirements once Employer's Requirements volumes are available (R1).
- **Responsible:** Design lead and quality reviewer.
- **Criteria:** **TBD** — pending ER requirements.
- **Status:** Requirements not yet available; verification criteria to be established when ER volumes provided.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 1-2 in Procedure.md.
