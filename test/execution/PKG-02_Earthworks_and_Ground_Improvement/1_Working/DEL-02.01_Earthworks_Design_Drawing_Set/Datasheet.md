## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Defines the design arrangement and details for earthworks per ER requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.01 entry (location TBD).

**Environmental/Operational Context:**
- Site conditions: **TBD** — pending geotechnical reports (DEL-02.04).
- Design criteria: **TBD** — pending ER requirements.
- Regulatory requirements: **TBD** — pending ER requirements and permit documentation.

## Drawing Content (Anticipated Artifacts mapped to Requirements)

The following drawing sheets and content are anticipated, mapped to Specification requirements:

1. **Grading plans** (R2): Site grading arrangement, finish grades, drainage slopes
   - Content: **TBD** — pending design inputs
   - Sheet count: **TBD**

2. **Cut/fill plans** (R3): Excavation limits, fill placement zones, quantities
   - Content: **TBD** — pending design calculations (DEL-02.03)
   - Sheet count: **TBD**

3. **Ground improvement layout** (R4): Ground improvement zones, treatment methods, limits
   - Content: **TBD** — pending geotechnical design (DEL-02.04)
   - Sheet count: **TBD**

4. **Sections** (R5): Cross-sections showing existing/proposed grades, ground improvement details, fill layers
   - Content: **TBD** — pending design inputs
   - Sheet count: **TBD**

**Configuration Notes:**
- All drawing content shall be coordinated with DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification) and DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations).
- Drawing details to be developed using inputs from DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports) and DEL-02.05 (Survey Reports).
- Details require ER volumes and design inputs (currently **TBD**).

## Cross-Document Alignment

- **Specification.md:** Requirements R1-R7 define the mandatory content and coverage for this drawing set.
- **Guidance.md:** Provides principles for clarity, constructability, and interface management that should inform drawing production.
- **Procedure.md:** Defines the production workflow and verification steps (Steps 1-5) to ensure drawing set completeness against R1-R7.
