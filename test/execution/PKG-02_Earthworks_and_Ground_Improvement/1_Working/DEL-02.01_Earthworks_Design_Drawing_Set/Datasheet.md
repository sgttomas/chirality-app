## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Defines the design arrangement and details for earthworks per ER requirements. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.01 entry (location TBD).

**Environmental/Operational Context:**
- Site conditions: **TBD** — pending geotechnical reports (DEL-02.04).
- Design criteria: **TBD** — pending ER requirements.
- Regulatory requirements: **TBD** — pending ER requirements and permit documentation.

## Drawing Content (Anticipated Artifacts mapped to Requirements)

The following drawing sheets and content are anticipated, mapped to Specification requirements:

| Item | Drawing Type | Specification § | Guidance § | Procedure Step | Content Status |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Grading plans | R2 | P1, P3 | Step 3.1 | **TBD** — pending design inputs |
| 2 | Cut/fill plans | R3 | P1, P3 | Step 3.2 | **TBD** — pending design calculations (DEL-02.03) |
| 3 | Ground improvement layout | R4 | P1, P3, P4 | Step 3.3 | **TBD** — pending geotechnical design (DEL-02.04) |
| 4 | Sections | R5 | P1, P3, P4 | Step 3.4 | **TBD** — pending design inputs |

**Configuration Notes:**
- All drawing content shall be coordinated with DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification) and DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations).
- Drawing details to be developed using inputs from DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports) and DEL-02.05 (Survey Reports).
- Details require ER volumes and design inputs (currently **TBD**).
