# Procedure: DEL-02.01 Earthworks Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Define the production workflow for the Earthworks Design Drawing Set to ensure the deliverable satisfies Specification requirements R1-R7, implements Guidance principles P1-P4, and supports PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement objectives.

**Dual-Use Note:** This procedure describes how to **produce** the drawing set deliverable. It does not describe field execution procedures (see DEL-02.07 Earthworks Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement for field procedures).
