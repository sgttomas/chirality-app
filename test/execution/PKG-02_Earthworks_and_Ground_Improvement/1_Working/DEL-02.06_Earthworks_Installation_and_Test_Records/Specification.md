    - R8: Records shall include document control elements (record package ID, date range, location/area, testing methods, QA/QC signoffs, revision) per D&B Contractor QA/QC system. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard D&B QA/QC documentation; details **TBD**. Verified by V1.
    - R9: Records shall be signed/approved by qualified field inspector, QA/QC manager, and geotechnical engineer (as applicable) to certify accuracy and acceptance. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: QA/QC approval workflow; **TBD**: ER may specify approval requirements. Verified by V1, V3.

    - **TBD**: Testing frequency requirements (e.g., one test per 500 m³ or per lift) per ER or industry standards.
    - **TBD**: Proof rolling criteria (equipment type, loaded weight, acceptance criteria) per ER or geotechnical recommendations from DEL-02.04.
    - **TBD**: Survey tolerance requirements (e.g., ±25 mm for structural subgrade, ±50 mm for general grading) per ER or DEL-02.01 drawing notes.

    ## Verification

    - V1 (maps to R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R8, R9): Verify records include all required content elements per `Datasheet.md` Record Content (compaction tests: location, date, method, results, acceptance comparison; proof rolling: equipment, observations, pass/fail; survey: as-built vs. design, conformance analysis) and document control/approval signatures. Method: QA/QC record review checklist against Specification R1–R9; verify calculations correct (e.g., percent compaction); verify test methods match specifications; verify signoffs complete. Records: QA/QC review checklist, record package approval signatures.
    - V2 (maps to R1, R2, R4, R5, R7): Verify records cover all PKG-02 earthworks areas (grading zones, fill areas, subgrade preparation) with sufficient testing density to demonstrate compliance; verify test results meet acceptance criteria from DEL-02.02 (Specifications) and DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports); verify deficiencies identified and corrected with follow-up testing. Method: Cross-reference record locations with DEL-02.01 earthworks limits; verify testing frequency meets ER requirements; compare test results to acceptance criteria; track deficiency resolution. Records: Testing location plan, acceptance criteria compliance matrix, deficiency corrective action log.
    - V3 (maps to R1, R9): Verify alignment with ER quality control requirements (testing methods, frequency, acceptance criteria, record format, approval authority) once Employer's Requirements volumes are available. Method: ER compliance review against specified QA/QC procedures; confirm ER-required approvals obtained (e.g., Employer's representative witnessing). Records: ER compliance matrix, Employer witness/approval documentation, record package acceptance.
