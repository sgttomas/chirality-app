# Guidance: DEL-02.06 Earthworks Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Earthworks Installation & Test Records aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements, and Procedure realization. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

## Principles

- **Real-Time Documentation**: Record field testing and inspection results immediately during construction to ensure accuracy, traceability, and timely identification of deficiencies requiring correction. **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with construction QA/QC best practices to prevent rework and delays.
- **Objective Evidence and Traceability**: Records must provide objective, verifiable evidence of compliance with acceptance criteria; clear traceability from test location to results to pass/fail determination to corrective action (if required). Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard QA/QC documentation principles.
- **Completeness and Coverage**: Testing and inspection shall cover all earthworks areas with sufficient density/frequency to demonstrate consistent compliance; gaps in record coverage create uncertainty and potential acceptance disputes. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Systematic quality verification requirement.
- **Approval Workflow and Accountability**: Records shall be reviewed and approved by qualified personnel (inspector, QA/QC manager, geotechnical engineer) to ensure technical adequacy and acceptance authority. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: QA/QC approval delegation; **TBD**: ER may specify approval requirements.
- Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Align record scope with PKG-02 earthworks activities (grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement, subgrade preparation). Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

## Requirement Traceability

- R1 (Evidence of compliance): Guidance emphasizes that records are the primary evidence for demonstrating work acceptance; incomplete or inaccurate records can delay project closeout or trigger disputes. Records must clearly demonstrate compliance with design requirements and acceptance criteria.
- R2, R3 (Compaction test records): Guidance highlights that compaction testing is critical quality control for fill performance; inadequate compaction leads to settlement, bearing failures, and pavement distress. Testing must be performed at correct frequency, using calibrated equipment, by trained personnel.
- R4 (Proof rolling records): Guidance notes that proof rolling provides qualitative verification of subgrade stability not captured by point density tests; identifies localized weak areas requiring remediation before pavement or structure construction.
- R5, R6 (Survey conformance records): Guidance emphasizes that grade verification is essential for drainage, structural bearing elevations, and interface with adjacent work; grades outside tolerance can cause ponding, foundation issues, or rework.
- R7 (PKG-02 scope coverage): Guidance highlights ensuring all earthworks zones are documented; missing records for any area can block acceptance of that work and delay subsequent construction.
- R8 (Document control): Guidance notes importance of organized, retrievable records for efficient review, audit trail, and closeout documentation; disorganized records waste time and create risk.
- R9 (QA/QC approvals): Guidance stresses that approval signoffs confirm technical review occurred and work meets acceptance criteria; missing approvals can invalidate records for acceptance purposes.

## Considerations

- **Testing Frequency and Locations**: Establish clear testing frequency (e.g., per volume, per lift, per area) and location pattern (e.g., grid, random, judgment-based in suspect areas) to ensure adequate coverage without excessive testing cost. **TBD**: ER will specify minimum testing frequency; **ASSUMPTION**: Adjust frequency based on field conditions (more testing if variability or failures observed).
- **Test Method Selection and Calibration**: Select appropriate field test method (nuclear gauge for speed, sand cone for accuracy/no radiation concerns, other methods for specific conditions); ensure equipment calibrated and operators trained/certified. **TBD**: ER may specify acceptable test methods. **ASSUMPTION**: Test method matched to soil type and accessibility.
- **Weather and Seasonal Constraints**: Document weather conditions during testing and construction; moisture-sensitive soils may require special handling or be unsuitable during wet weather; freezing conditions affect compaction and testing validity. **ASSUMPTION**: Weather documentation supports construction records and potential time extension claims.
- **Deficiency Identification and Corrective Action**: When tests fail (compaction below criterion, soft areas in proof rolling, grades out of tolerance), immediately identify extent of deficiency, implement corrective action (recompaction, replacement, regrading), and retest to verify correction. Track deficiency resolution to closure. **ASSUMPTION**: Systematic deficiency resolution process prevents accumulation of unresolved issues.
- **Real-Time Data Management**: Use field data collection tools (tablets, mobile apps, GPS-enabled equipment) to improve efficiency, accuracy, and real-time visibility of testing results; facilitates rapid response to failures. **ASSUMPTION**: Modern QA/QC data management practices improve quality and reduce paperwork.
- **Coordination with Subsequent Work**: Ensure subgrade acceptance records (compaction, proof rolling, survey) are complete and approved before allowing pavement installation (PKG-04), foundation construction (PKG-05, PKG-06), or other subsequent work; prevents building on unverified subgrade. **ASSUMPTION**: Phased acceptance gates control construction sequence.
- Tie Datasheet Attributes to Specification requirements (R1–R9) to ensure record completeness. **ASSUMPTION**: Cross-document consistency ensures nothing falls through gaps.
- Environmental and regulatory constraints (e.g., contaminated soil handling records, erosion control inspections) should be captured once references become available. **TBD** pending Employer's Requirements volumes.
- Contractor QA/QC procedures should confirm record generation, review, and approval workflow per Specification requirements and `Procedure.md` steps. **ASSUMPTION**: Typical D&B QA/QC practice with documented procedures and trained personnel.

## Trade-offs

- **Testing Frequency vs. Cost**: More frequent testing increases confidence in quality but also increases cost and may slow construction; insufficient testing leaves quality uncertainty and risk of undetected deficiencies. Guidance: Follow ER minimum frequency as baseline; increase frequency in critical areas (structure foundations, pavement subgrade) or where variability/failures observed; decrease in homogeneous, low-risk areas if ER permits.
- **Field Test Methods vs. Accuracy/Speed**: Nuclear density gauge provides rapid results enabling real-time construction decisions but involves radiation safety and may have accuracy limitations in some soils; sand cone more accurate and universally applicable but slower. Guidance: Use Specification R2 and ER test method requirements; select method appropriate for soil type, access, and schedule criticality.
- **Detailed Documentation vs. Schedule**: Comprehensive documentation (photographs, detailed narratives, extensive data) provides thorough record but takes time; minimal documentation faster but may lack detail for future reference or dispute resolution. Guidance: Use Specification requirements (R1–R9) and `Procedure.md` to define minimum documentation; add detail in critical areas or where issues arise; balance thoroughness with construction pace.
- **Immediate Correction vs. Production**: When deficiencies identified (failed compaction test, soft proof rolling area, grade out of tolerance), immediate correction stops production to fix issue; deferring correction maintains production but risks compounding problem or building on deficient work. Guidance: Reference Specification verification approach (V2) and `Procedure.md` deficiency resolution steps; prioritize immediate correction of significant deficiencies (structural areas, deep fills); minor deficiencies in non-critical areas may be batched for efficiency if approved by geotechnical engineer.
