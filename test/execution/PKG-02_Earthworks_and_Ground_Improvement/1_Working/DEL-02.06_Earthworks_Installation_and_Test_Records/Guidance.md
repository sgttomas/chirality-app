# Guidance: DEL-02.06 Earthworks Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Earthworks Installation & Test Records aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements R1-R9, and Procedure realization.

**Deliverable Role:** Installation and test records provide objective evidence that earthworks have been constructed and tested in compliance with design requirements. They are essential for construction acceptance, regulatory compliance, and project closeout.

## Principles

### Real-Time Documentation
**Principle:** Record field testing and inspection results immediately during construction to ensure accuracy, traceability, and timely identification of deficiencies requiring correction.

**Rationale:** Delayed documentation leads to inaccurate records, missed deficiencies, and lost opportunity for timely correction. Real-time documentation supports quality and schedule.

**Application:**
- Record test results immediately upon completion.
- Use field data collection tools for efficiency.
- Document weather and site conditions at time of testing.
- Flag failures immediately for corrective action.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with construction QA/QC best practices.

| Specification mapping | R1, R2, R3 |
| Datasheet mapping | All Record Content sections |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6, 8, 10, 12 |

### Objective Evidence and Traceability
**Principle:** Records must provide objective, verifiable evidence of compliance with acceptance criteria; clear traceability from test location to results to pass/fail determination to corrective action.

**Rationale:** Construction acceptance and project closeout depend on demonstrable compliance. Incomplete or unverifiable records create disputes and delays.

**Application:**
- Include all data elements required by Specification.
- Clearly link test results to acceptance criteria.
- Document corrective actions and retests for failures.
- Maintain clear audit trail.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Standard QA/QC documentation principles.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Specification mapping | R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 |
| Datasheet mapping | All data elements in each record type |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6-12, 15 |

### Completeness and Coverage
**Principle:** Testing and inspection shall cover all earthworks areas with sufficient density/frequency to demonstrate consistent compliance; gaps in record coverage create uncertainty.

**Rationale:** Acceptance requires evidence across all work areas. Missing records may block acceptance and delay subsequent work.

**Application:**
- Establish testing frequency per ER or specifications.
- Create testing location plan to visualize coverage.
- Ensure no areas are missed.
- Document testing density achieved.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Systematic quality verification requirement.

| Specification mapping | R7 |
| Datasheet mapping | Location/area attribute |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2, 16 |

### Approval Workflow and Accountability
**Principle:** Records shall be reviewed and approved by qualified personnel (inspector, QA/QC manager, geotechnical engineer) to ensure technical adequacy and acceptance authority.

**Rationale:** Proper approvals confirm technical review occurred and work meets criteria. Missing approvals may invalidate records.

**Application:**
- Field inspector signs each test record.
- QA/QC manager reviews and approves daily records.
- Geotechnical engineer reviews critical areas.
- Maintain approval chain documentation.
- **TBD**: ER may specify approval requirements.

## Considerations

### Testing Frequency and Locations
- Establish clear testing frequency (per volume, per lift, per area) and location pattern.
- **TBD**: ER will specify minimum testing frequency.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Adjust frequency based on field conditions (more if variability or failures).
- **Procedure reference:** Step 2.

### Test Method Selection and Calibration
- Select appropriate field test method (nuclear gauge for speed, sand cone for accuracy).
- Ensure equipment calibrated and operators trained/certified.
- **TBD**: ER may specify acceptable test methods.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 5.

### Weather and Seasonal Constraints
- Document weather conditions during testing and construction.
- Moisture-sensitive soils may require special handling.
- Weather documentation supports construction records and potential claims.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 6, 8, 10.

### Deficiency Identification and Corrective Action
- When tests fail, immediately identify extent, implement correction, and retest.
- Track deficiency resolution to closure.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Systematic deficiency resolution process.
- **Procedure reference:** Steps 7, 9, 11.

### Coordination with Subsequent Work
- Ensure subgrade acceptance records complete and approved before subsequent construction.
- Coordinate with PKG-04, PKG-05, PKG-06.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Phased acceptance gates control construction sequence.
- **Procedure reference:** Step 21.

## Trade-offs

### Testing Frequency vs. Cost
**Trade-off:** More frequent testing increases confidence but also cost; insufficient testing leaves quality uncertainty.

**Guidance:** Follow ER minimum frequency; increase in critical areas or where variability observed.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle reference | Coverage |
| Specification mapping | R2, R7 |
| Procedure Step | Step 2 |

### Field Test Methods vs. Accuracy/Speed
**Trade-off:** Nuclear gauge provides rapid results but has limitations; sand cone more accurate but slower.

**Guidance:** Select method appropriate for soil type, access, and schedule criticality.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle reference | Real-Time Documentation |
| Specification mapping | R2 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 5-6 |

### Detailed Documentation vs. Schedule
**Trade-off:** Comprehensive documentation provides thorough record but takes time; minimal documentation faster but may lack detail.

**Guidance:** Use R1-R9 to define minimum; add detail in critical areas or where issues arise.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle reference | Objective Evidence |
| Specification mapping | R1-R6 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6, 8, 10 |

### Immediate Correction vs. Production
**Trade-off:** Immediate correction stops production; deferring risks compounding problems.

**Guidance:** Prioritize immediate correction of significant deficiencies; minor deficiencies may be batched if approved.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle reference | Objective Evidence |
| Procedure Step | Steps 7, 9, 11 |
