    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for earthworks activities to demonstrate compliance with design requirements and acceptance criteria. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (references not yet provided; ER will define compaction requirements, testing frequency, acceptance criteria, weather constraints).
    - **ASSUMPTION**: Records generated during construction execution by field QA/QC personnel; compiled and submitted for Employer review/acceptance.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings – for design grades/limits), DEL-02.02 (Specifications – for acceptance criteria), DEL-02.03 (Calculations – for earthworks quantities), DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program – for testing protocols).

    ## Record Content

    **Compaction Test Records:**
    - Test location (stationing, grid coordinates, elevation)
    - Test date and weather conditions
    - Soil/fill material description and source
    - Test method (nuclear density gauge, sand cone, other)
    - Field test results (dry density, moisture content)
    - Laboratory maximum density and optimum moisture (standard or modified Proctor)
    - Percent compaction achieved vs. specification requirement
    - Pass/fail determination and corrective action (if failed)
    - Inspector name and signature
    - Geotechnical engineer review/acceptance (if required)

    **Proof Rolling Records:**
    - Proof rolling date and weather conditions
    - Area/limits proof rolled (stationing, grid coordinates)
    - Proof rolling equipment (loaded truck weight, axle configuration)
    - Visual observations (deflections, rutting, pumping, soft areas identified)
    - Pass/fail determination and remedial action (if failed areas identified)
    - Inspector name and signature
    - Photographs of proof rolling operations and any deficient areas

    **Survey Conformance Records:**
    - Survey date and surveyor identification
    - Location/area surveyed (stationing, grid coordinates)
    - As-built elevations vs. design grades from DEL-02.01
    - Grade conformance (within tolerance or requiring correction)
    - Survey data (spot elevations, cross-sections, as-built surface model)
    - Pass/fail determination and corrective grading (if required)
    - Surveyor certification/signature

    **Configuration notes:**

    - **TBD** (details require ER volumes and design inputs; ER will specify compaction requirements, testing frequency per ASTM standards, acceptance criteria, record format/submittal requirements).
    - Records organized by earthworks zone, construction sequence, or activity type for easy retrieval and review.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.09 (In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results) for compaction testing methodology and acceptance criteria.
    - Coordination with PKG-04 (Pavements), PKG-05 (Concrete Structures), PKG-06 (Structural Steelwork) for subgrade acceptance records required before subsequent work.

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` (R1–R9) is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how record quality, completeness, traceability, and timely documentation influence construction acceptance and closeout.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` describe the process for field testing, recording data, compiling records, and obtaining QA/QC approvals during construction.
    - Verification items in `Specification.md` (V1–V3) map to record completeness checks, acceptance criteria compliance verification, and ER requirement conformance.
