# Procedure: DEL-02.06 Earthworks Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Generate and compile Earthworks Installation & Test Records (compaction tests, proof rolling, survey conformance) during PKG-02 construction execution to provide objective evidence of compliance with Specification requirements R1-R9 and Guidance principles.

**Dual-Use Note:** This procedure describes how to **generate and compile** test records during construction. Design of the testing program is addressed in DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program) and DEL-02.09 (Compaction Verification Plan).

|------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| 6 | Perform field density tests at specified frequency and locations; record all data on compaction test forms | R2, R3 | Real-Time Documentation | Compaction Test Records |
| 7 | Compare results to acceptance criteria; if failed, implement corrective action, recompact, retest | R2, R3 | Deficiency Resolution | Pass/fail determination |
| 8 | Perform proof rolling of subgrade areas; observe for deflections, rutting, soft areas; record on proof rolling forms | R4 | Coverage | Proof Rolling Records |
| 9 | If soft areas identified, mark limits, remediate, retest compaction, re-proof roll | R4 | Deficiency Resolution | Remedial actions |
| 10 | Perform as-built survey after earthworks completion; compare to design grades from DEL-02.01; record on survey forms | R5, R6 | Completeness | Survey Conformance Records |
| 11 | If grades outside tolerance, perform corrective grading, recompact, re-survey | R5, R6 | Deficiency Resolution | Corrective action |
| 12 | Field inspector signs/dates each test record upon completion | R9 | Approval Workflow | Inspector signature |

### Phase 3: Record Review and Compilation

| Step | Action | Specification § | Guidance § | Records |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| 13 | Submit daily field records to QA/QC manager for review; QA/QC manager verifies completeness, calculations, acceptance, approves | R8, R9 | Approval Workflow | QA/QC approval signatures |
| 14 | Geotechnical engineer reviews and approves compaction results for critical areas (if required) | R9 | Approval Workflow | Geotechnical approval |
| 15 | Compile approved records into organized record package per Datasheet attributes | R8 | Document Control | Record package |
| 16 | Create testing location plan showing all test locations overlaid on DEL-02.01 earthworks plan | R7 | Coverage | Testing location plan |
| 17 | Prepare acceptance criteria compliance summary matrix | R1, R7 | Objective Evidence | Compliance matrix |

### Phase 4: Record Submittal and Acceptance
