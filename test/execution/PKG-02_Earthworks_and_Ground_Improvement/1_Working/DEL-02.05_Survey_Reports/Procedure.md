# Procedure: DEL-02.05 Survey Reports

    ## Purpose

    Produce the Survey Reports required for PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement while satisfying Specification requirements and supporting Guidance principles. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

    ## Prerequisites

    - **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).
    - **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements volumes and relevant site data are required but not provided in _REFERENCES.md (TBD).
    - **Inputs:** PKG-02 scope for earthworks and ground improvement. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

    ## Steps


1. Compile inputs (ER volumes, geotechnical reports, surveys, permits) and align them with Datasheet attributes to confirm completeness. TBD until references are provided.
2. Confirm scope and interface boundaries per PKG-02 scope and Scope Focus, ensuring Specification requirements R1–R5 are covered. Source: decomposition (location TBD); `Specification.md`.
3. Develop deliverable content aligned with anticipated artifacts and Guidance considerations, using Datasheet attributes to document progress. Source: _CONTEXT.md; `Guidance.md`.
4. Perform internal checks against Specification verification items (V1–V3), update Datasheet/Guidance as needed, and ensure records support R1–R5.
5. Issue controlled deliverable per document control requirements and capture review/approval records. ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control.


    ## Verification

    - Check that required artifacts are present and complete, referencing Datasheet and Specification requirements. ASSUMPTION: document review.
    - Check coverage of PKG-02 scope items and Guidance considerations. ASSUMPTION: scope compliance review.
    - ER compliance check: TBD pending ER volumes; align with Specification verification notes (V1–V3).

    ## Records

    - Issued Survey Reports (controlled revisions).
    - Review comments, approvals, and response log. ASSUMPTION: standard document control practice.

    ## References

    - _CONTEXT.md (deliverable identity, description, anticipated artifacts).
    - _DEPENDENCIES.md (NOT_TRACKED).
    - Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-02 scope, DEL-02 entries; location TBD).
    - `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md` for verification/context alignment.
    - _REFERENCES.md indicates no references yet.
