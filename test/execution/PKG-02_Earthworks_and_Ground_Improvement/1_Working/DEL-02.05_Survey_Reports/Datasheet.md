    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Documents analysis and results for survey reports required for design verification and approvals. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (references not yet provided; ER will define site boundaries, existing features to be surveyed, coordinate system, required accuracy).
    - **ASSUMPTION**: Surveys will be performed by licensed professional land surveyor as required by regulatory authority.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – for investigation locations), all design packages for existing conditions baseline.

    ## Report Content

    **Topographic Survey Report:**
    - Survey methodology and equipment
    - Survey control network (horizontal/vertical control points, benchmarks)
    - Coordinate system and datum
    - Site topography (contours, elevations, features)
    - Existing structures, pavements, drainage features
    - Vegetation and property boundaries
    - Survey accuracy statement and certification
    - Digital survey data (CAD files, GIS data, point cloud if applicable)
    - Survey plan sheets showing existing conditions

    **Utility Locate Report:**
    - Utility investigation methodology (records search, field locating methods)
    - Existing utilities identified (type, location, depth, owner)
    - Underground utility markings and survey coordinates
    - Utility conflict assessment with proposed design
    - Limitations and disclaimers (e.g., private utilities not in public records)
    - Utility location plan sheets
    - Coordination with utility owners for verification

    **Configuration notes:**

    - **TBD** (details require ER volumes and design inputs; ER will specify survey scope, accuracy requirements, deliverable formats, coordinate system).
    - Survey reports must be compatible with CAD/BIM software used for design (e.g., AutoCAD, Civil 3D).
    - Utility locates may require coordination with utility owners and third-party locating services (e.g., one-call services).
    - Coordination with PKG-04 (Pavements), PKG-05 (Concrete Structures), PKG-06 (Structural Steelwork), PKG-08 (Marine Structures) for existing conditions in their design areas.

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` (R1–R8) is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how survey accuracy, data quality, and coordination influence deliverable execution.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` describe the process for performing surveys, preparing reports, and verifying data quality.
    - Verification items in `Specification.md` (V1–V3) map to survey content completeness, accuracy compliance, and data usability checks.

    ## References

    - _CONTEXT.md, `Documentation for deliverable identity and anticipated artifacts`.
    - Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-02 scope, DEL-02 entries; location TBD).
    - _REFERENCES.md is empty; Employer's Requirements volumes listed in decomposition remain pending (TBD).
