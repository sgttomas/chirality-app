# Guidance: DEL-02.05 Survey Reports

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Survey Reports aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements, and Procedure realization. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

## Principles

- Clarity and constructability drive the drawing detail to support safe execution and Contractor scope coverage. ASSUMPTION: aligns with project safety objectives.
- Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Align deliverable content with PKG-02 earthworks scope (grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement, geotechnical works, surveys). Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

## Requirement Traceability

- R1: Documents analysis and results for survey reports required for design verification and approvals. Source: decomposition DEL-02 entry and _CONTEXT.md (location TBD). Guidance highlights how this requirement influences drawing clarity and constructability.
- R2: Include Topographic survey. Source: _CONTEXT.md. Guidance highlights how this requirement influences drawing clarity and constructability.
- R3: Include utility locate report. Source: _CONTEXT.md. Guidance highlights how this requirement influences drawing clarity and constructability.
- R4: Address grading, excavation, fill placement, ground improvement, geotechnical and survey scope for PKG-02. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD). Guidance highlights how this requirement influences drawing clarity and constructability.
- R5: Document control fields (title, revision, dates, approvals) shall be included. Source: ASSUMPTION: standard D&B document control; details TBD. Guidance highlights how this requirement influences drawing clarity and constructability.

## Considerations

- Tie the Datasheet Attributes to Specification requirements to avoid gaps in what is documented vs. what is required. ASSUMPTION: ensures cross-document completeness.
- Environmental and regulatory constraints, as well as terminal continuity impacts, should be captured once references become available. TBD pending Employer's Requirements volumes.
- Contractor QA/QC procedures should confirm that drawing deliverables capture the scope and verification steps shown in `Procedure.md`. ASSUMPTION: typical D&B QA/QC practice.

## Trade-offs

- Level of drawing detail vs. schedule and revision effort; use Specification requirements to guide the balance. ASSUMPTION: project controls define the right balance.
- Prescriptive vs. performance-based content decisions should reference both Specification requirements and Procedure verification steps. ASSUMPTION: context TBD.

## Procedure Coordination

- Steps in `Procedure.md` implement the verification expectations outlined above and reference Specification requirements by ID.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

- None identified from available sources.

## References

- _CONTEXT.md (deliverable identity, description, anticipated artifacts).
- Decomposition file: `test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md` (PKG-02 scope, DEL-02 entries; location TBD).
- `Specification.md` and `Procedure.md` for alignment context.
- _REFERENCES.md indicates no references yet.
