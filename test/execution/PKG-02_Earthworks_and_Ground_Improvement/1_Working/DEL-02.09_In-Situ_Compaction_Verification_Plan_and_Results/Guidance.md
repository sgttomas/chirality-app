# Guidance: DEL-02.09 In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements (R1-R10), and Procedure realization (Steps 1-13). Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.09 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

### P1: Systematic Verification Planning
Clear, documented plan defining testing methodology, frequency, and acceptance criteria ensures consistent, repeatable compaction verification; prevents ad-hoc approaches that miss areas or create disputes.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with QA/QC best practices and quality system requirements |
| Specification § | R1, R2, R6, R7, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Plan items 1-10, Attributes table |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2-4 |

### P2: Real-Time Compliance Monitoring
Field testing during fill placement enables immediate detection of compaction deficiencies and corrective action; waiting until completion risks extensive rework.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Proactive quality control prevents costly corrections |
| Specification § | R1, R3 |
| Datasheet mapping | Test Results items 1, 3 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 5-6 |

### P3: Proactive Nonconformance Resolution
Failed tests require immediate investigation, corrective action, and retesting to closure; deferring correction compounds problems and delays acceptance.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Systematic deficiency management prevents backlog |
| Specification § | R4, R10 |
| Datasheet mapping | Nonconformance Reports items 1-6 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 7-8, 11 |

### P4: Statistical Demonstration of Compliance
Adequate test frequency and coverage (not just minimum ER requirements) provides statistical confidence that fill quality is consistent across entire area; isolated tests leave uncertainty.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Risk-based quality verification |
| Specification § | R1, R3, R5 |
| Datasheet mapping | Test Results items 3-4, Location/area attribute |
| Procedure Step | Steps 9-10 |

**Scope Boundary:** Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Considerations

### C1: Trial Compaction Value
Trial compaction demonstrates proposed equipment/methodology achieves criteria; optimizes lift thickness and roller passes for production efficiency. Consider for large fill volumes, challenging soils, or where production failures would be costly.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: ER may require trial compaction |
| Specification § | R9 |
| Datasheet mapping | Plan item 6, Test Results item 2 |
| Procedure Step | Step 3 |

### C2: Testing Method Selection
Nuclear gauge provides rapid results enabling real-time decisions; sand cone more accurate in some soils but slower. Balance speed vs. accuracy vs. radiation safety considerations.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Method selected per DEL-02.08 and ER approval |
| Specification § | R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Testing method attribute, Plan item 4 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2, 5 |

### C3: Frequency Optimization
Minimum ER frequency establishes baseline; increase in critical areas (structure foundations, variable materials), maintain minimum in homogeneous areas. Reference DEL-02.08 risk-based approach.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: ER minimum frequency |
| Specification § | R5, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Test frequency attribute, Plan item 5 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2, 5 |

### C4: Moisture Control Importance
Compaction effectiveness highly sensitive to moisture content; testing near optimum moisture from Proctor test is critical. Plan may need moisture conditioning procedures (wetting, drying, weathering).

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Moisture management per geotechnical recommendations from DEL-02.04 |
| Specification § | R7 |
| Datasheet mapping | Plan item 3 (laboratory reference values), Acceptance criteria |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2, 7 |

### C5: Equipment Calibration
Field testing equipment (nuclear gauge, sand cone apparatus) must be calibrated and checked regularly; calibration records required for test validity.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Calibration per manufacturer and ASTM standards |
| Specification § | R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Plan items 7-8 |
| Procedure Step | Step 5 |

## Requirement Traceability

| Requirement | Guidance Section | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| R1 (Plan and results) | P1, P2, P4 | Plan component establishes framework for consistent verification; results component provides objective evidence for acceptance; both required for complete quality documentation |
| R2 (Plan content) | P1, C1-C5 | Plan prevents ambiguity about what, where, when, how to test; approved plan provides common understanding among contractor, inspector, geotechnical engineer, Employer |
| R3 (Test results) | P2, P4 | Results must be complete (all areas tested per frequency), accurate (calibrated equipment, qualified technicians), and organized (test location plan, statistical summary) for efficient review |
| R4 (NCR resolution) | P3, T2 | Open nonconformances block final acceptance; systematic tracking ensures nothing falls through cracks; root cause analysis prevents recurring failures |
| R5 (PKG-02 scope) | P4, C3 | All fill areas must be addressed; gaps in verification create acceptance risk |
| R6 (Document control) | P1 | Plan may require updates if field conditions differ from assumptions; revision tracking essential |
| R7 (Design consistency) | P1, C4 | Acceptance criteria must match specifications; disconnect causes confusion and potential rejection |
| R8 (Testing compliance) | P1, C2, C5 | Testing per approved methods and qualified personnel ensures credible results; shortcuts invalidate verification |
| R9 (Trial compaction) | C1, T1 | Trial compaction reduces risk of production failures; demonstrates equipment/methodology work before committing to large volumes |
| R10 (NCR closure) | P3, T2 | Incomplete closure blocks final acceptance and project closeout |

## Trade-offs

### T1: Testing Frequency vs. Cost/Schedule
More tests increase confidence but also cost and time.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Follow ER minimums as baseline; increase in critical/variable areas; use trial compaction to optimize before production |
| Specification § | R8, R9 |
| Datasheet mapping | Test frequency attribute, Plan item 6 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2-3 |

### T2: Immediate Retest vs. Production Pace
Failed test stops production for correction and retest; deferring risks building on deficient fill.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Immediate correction per R10 for significant failures; batch minor issues only if geotechnical engineer approves |
| Specification § | R4, R10 |
| Datasheet mapping | Nonconformance Reports items 3-5 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 7-8 |

### T3: Detailed Plan vs. Start Schedule
Comprehensive plan takes time; abbreviated plan allows faster start.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Use R1-R10 to define minimum content; develop and approve plan before fill placement; critical for quality and acceptance |
| Specification § | R1, R2 |
| Datasheet mapping | All Plan items |
| Procedure Step | Steps 2-4 |
