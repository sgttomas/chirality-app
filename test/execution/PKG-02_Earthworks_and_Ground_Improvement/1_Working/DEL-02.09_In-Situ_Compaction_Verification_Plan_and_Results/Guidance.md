# Guidance: DEL-02.09 In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements, and Procedure realization. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

## Principles

- **Systematic Verification Planning**: Clear, documented plan defining testing methodology, frequency, and acceptance criteria ensures consistent, repeatable compaction verification; prevents ad-hoc approaches that miss areas or create disputes. **ASSUMPTION**: Aligns with QA/QC best practices and quality system requirements.
- **Real-Time Compliance Monitoring**: Field testing during fill placement enables immediate detection of compaction deficiencies and corrective action; waiting until completion risks extensive rework. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Proactive quality control prevents costly corrections.
- **Proactive Nonconformance Resolution**: Failed tests require immediate investigation, corrective action, and retesting to closure; deferring correction compounds problems and delays acceptance. Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Systematic deficiency management prevents backlog.
- **Statistical Demonstration of Compliance**: Adequate test frequency and coverage (not just minimum ER requirements) provides statistical confidence that fill quality is consistent across entire area; isolated tests leave uncertainty. **ASSUMPTION**: Risk-based quality verification.
- Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Align compaction verification with PKG-02 fill placement scope (grading fill, structural fill, subgrade preparation). Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

## Requirement Traceability

- R1 (Plan and results): Guidance emphasizes plan component establishes framework for consistent verification; results component provides objective evidence for acceptance; both required for complete quality documentation.
- R2 (Compaction verification plan): Guidance highlights plan prevents ambiguity about what, where, when, how to test; approved plan provides common understanding among contractor, inspector, geotechnical engineer, Employer.
- R3 (Test results): Guidance notes results must be complete (all areas tested per frequency), accurate (calibrated equipment, qualified technicians), and organized (test location plan, statistical summary) for efficient review.
- R4 (Nonconformance resolution): Guidance stresses open nonconformances block final acceptance; systematic tracking ensures nothing falls through cracks; root cause analysis prevents recurring failures.
- R5 (PKG-02 scope): Guidance ensures all fill areas addressed; gaps in verification create acceptance risk.
- R6 (Document control): Guidance notes plan may require updates if field conditions differ from assumptions; revision tracking essential.
- R7 (Consistency with design): Guidance emphasizes acceptance criteria must match specifications; disconnect causes confusion and potential rejection.
- R8 (Testing methods compliance): Guidance highlights testing per approved methods and qualified personnel ensures credible results; shortcuts invalidate verification.
- R9 (Trial compaction): Guidance notes trial compaction reduces risk of production failures; demonstrates equipment/methodology work before committing to large volumes.
- R10 (Nonconformance closure): Guidance stresses incomplete closure blocks final acceptance and project closeout.

## Considerations

- **Trial Compaction Value**: Trial compaction demonstrates proposed equipment/methodology achieves criteria; optimizes lift thickness and roller passes for production efficiency. Consider for large fill volumes, challenging soils, or where production failures would be costly. **TBD**: ER may require trial compaction.
- **Testing Method Selection**: Nuclear gauge provides rapid results enabling real-time decisions; sand cone more accurate in some soils but slower. Balance speed vs. accuracy vs. radiation safety considerations. **ASSUMPTION**: Method selected per DEL-02.08 and ER approval.
- **Frequency Optimization**: Minimum ER frequency establishes baseline; increase in critical areas (structure foundations, variable materials), maintain minimum in homogeneous areas. Reference DEL-02.08 risk-based approach. **TBD**: ER minimum frequency.
- **Moisture Control Importance**: Compaction effectiveness highly sensitive to moisture content; testing near optimum moisture from Proctor test is critical. Plan may need moisture conditioning procedures (wetting, drying, weathering). **ASSUMPTION**: Moisture management per geotechnical recommendations.
- **Equipment Calibration**: Field testing equipment (nuclear gauge, sand cone apparatus) must be calibrated and checked regularly; calibration records required for test validity. **ASSUMPTION**: Calibration per manufacturer and ASTM standards.
- Tie Datasheet Attributes to Specification requirements (R1–R10) to ensure completeness. **ASSUMPTION**: Cross-document consistency.

## Trade-offs

- **Testing Frequency vs. Cost/Schedule**: More tests increase confidence but also cost and time; balance per R8 and DEL-02.08 approach. Guidance: Follow ER minimums; increase in critical/variable areas; use trial compaction to optimize before production.
- **Immediate Retest vs. Production Pace**: Failed test stops production for correction and retest; deferring risks building on deficient fill. Guidance: Immediate correction per R10 for significant failures; batch minor issues if geotechnical engineer approves.
- **Detailed Plan vs. Start Schedule**: Comprehensive plan takes time; abbreviated plan allows faster start. Guidance: Use R1–R10 to define minimum content; develop and approve plan before fill placement; critical for quality and acceptance.
