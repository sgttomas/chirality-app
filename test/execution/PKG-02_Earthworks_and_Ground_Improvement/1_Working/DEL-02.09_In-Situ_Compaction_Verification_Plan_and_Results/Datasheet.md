    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Provides compaction verification plan defining testing methodology and acceptance criteria, plus test results documenting compliance; evidence for fill placement acceptance. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (references not yet provided; ER will define compaction requirements, testing methods/frequency, acceptance criteria).
    - **ASSUMPTION**: Plan developed before fill placement; results generated during construction; nonconformances tracked to closure.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.02 (Specifications – compaction criteria), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – Proctor values), DEL-02.06 (Installation & Test Records – broader record package), DEL-02.07 (Method Statement – compaction methodology), DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program – testing protocols).

    ## Record Content

    **Compaction Verification Plan:**
    - Plan objectives and scope (fill areas, volumes, materials requiring compaction verification)
    - Compaction acceptance criteria (percent standard/modified Proctor per DEL-02.02 Specifications and DEL-02.04 Geotechnical Reports)
    - Laboratory reference values (maximum dry density, optimum moisture content from Proctor tests per material type/source)
    - Field testing methods (nuclear density gauge ASTM D6938, sand cone ASTM D1556, or other approved methods)
    - Testing frequency and locations (per DEL-02.08 frequency matrix and ER requirements)
    - Trial compaction requirements (if specified, to optimize lift thickness and equipment for production)
    - Equipment calibration and technician qualification requirements
    - Nonconformance procedure (failed test response, recompaction, retesting, documentation)
    - Approval workflow (field inspector, QA/QC manager, geotechnical engineer review/acceptance)

    **Test Results:**
    - Compiled field density test records (location, date, test method, field dry density, field moisture, laboratory reference, percent compaction, pass/fail per acceptance criteria)
    - Trial compaction results (if performed, demonstrating equipment/methodology effectiveness)
    - Test location plan (map showing all density test locations overlaid on fill placement areas)
    - Statistical summary (number of tests, pass rate, average percent compaction, range, by fill zone or material type)
    - Proof rolling results (if part of compaction verification, observations and acceptance)

    **Nonconformance Reports and Closeout:**
    - Failed test documentation (test location, test results, extent of deficient area, root cause analysis)
    - Corrective action (recompaction procedures, additional moisture/drying, material replacement, equipment changes)
    - Retest results (verification that corrective action achieved acceptance criteria)
    - Nonconformance closure (QA/QC manager or geotechnical engineer approval of corrective action and retest)
    - Final acceptance summary (all fill areas tested, all nonconformances closed, overall compliance demonstrated)

    **Configuration notes:**

    - **TBD** (details require ER volumes and design inputs; ER will specify compaction requirements, testing frequency/methods, acceptance criteria, trial compaction requirements).
    - Plan component submitted for approval before fill placement; results component compiled progressively during construction; nonconformance closure before final acceptance.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.06 (Installation & Test Records) to avoid duplication; DEL-02.09 may be subset focused on compaction or integrated with DEL-02.06 depending on ER/project preferences.

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` (R1–R10) is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how systematic verification planning, real-time compliance monitoring, and proactive nonconformance resolution influence compaction quality and acceptance.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` describe the process for developing verification plan, executing field testing, documenting results, resolving nonconformances, and obtaining final acceptance.
    - Verification items in `Specification.md` (V1–V3) map to plan/results completeness checks, acceptance criteria compliance verification, and ER requirement conformance.
