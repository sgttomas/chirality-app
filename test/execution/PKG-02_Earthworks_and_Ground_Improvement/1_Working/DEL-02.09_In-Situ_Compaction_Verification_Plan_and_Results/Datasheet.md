## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Provides compaction verification plan defining testing methodology and acceptance criteria, plus test results documenting compliance; evidence for fill placement acceptance. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.09 entry (location TBD).

**Environmental/Operational Context:**
- Operating/environmental details: **TBD** — pending ER volumes; ER will define compaction requirements, testing methods/frequency, acceptance criteria.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Plan developed before fill placement; results generated during construction; nonconformances tracked to closure.

**Interface Coordination:**
- DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification): Compaction acceptance criteria (% Proctor).
- DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports): Proctor test values (maximum dry density, optimum moisture).
- DEL-02.06 (Installation & Test Records): Broader record-keeping integration.
- DEL-02.07 (Method Statement): Compaction methodology, execution timing.
- DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program): Testing protocols, frequency matrix, methods.

### Test Results

| Item | Content Element | Specification § | Guidance § | Procedure Step | Status |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|--------|

**Configuration Notes:**
- Plan component submitted for approval before fill placement; results component compiled progressively during construction.
- Coordination with DEL-02.06 (Installation & Test Records) to avoid duplication; DEL-02.09 may be subset focused on compaction or integrated with DEL-02.06 depending on ER/project preferences.
- Details require ER volumes and design inputs (currently **TBD**).
