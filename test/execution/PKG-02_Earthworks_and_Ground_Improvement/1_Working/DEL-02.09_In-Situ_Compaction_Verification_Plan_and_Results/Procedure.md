# Procedure: DEL-02.09 In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results

    ## Purpose

    Produce the In-Situ Compaction Verification Plan & Results required for PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement while satisfying Specification requirements and supporting Guidance principles. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (location TBD).

    ## Prerequisites

    - **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see _DEPENDENCIES.md).
    - **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements volumes and relevant site data are required but not provided in _REFERENCES.md (TBD).
    - **Inputs:** PKG-02 scope for earthworks and ground improvement. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

    ## Steps

### Phase 1: Compaction Verification Plan Development

1. Review ER compaction requirements, DEL-02.02 (Specifications – compaction criteria), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – Proctor values), DEL-02.08 (Testing Program – methods/frequency) to understand acceptance criteria and testing requirements. **TBD** until ER provided. Maps to R1, R2, R5, R7, R8.
2. Develop compaction verification plan per `Datasheet.md` Plan content: objectives/scope, acceptance criteria (% Proctor per DEL-02.02/DEL-02.04), laboratory reference values (Proctor test results from DEL-02.08), field testing methods (nuclear gauge, sand cone per ASTM standards), testing frequency/locations (per DEL-02.08 frequency matrix and ER requirements), trial compaction requirements (if specified), equipment calibration/technician qualification, nonconformance procedure, approval workflow. Maps to R2, R7, R8. Reference `Guidance.md` Systematic Verification Planning and Trial Compaction Value.
3. If trial compaction required, coordinate with construction team to establish trial area, perform trial compaction with proposed equipment/methodology, document results, optimize lift thickness and compaction effort to achieve acceptance criteria. Maps to R9. Reference `Guidance.md` considerations. **TBD**: ER may specify trial compaction requirements.
4. Obtain internal approvals (QA/QC manager, geotechnical engineer) and submit plan to Employer for review/approval if required by ER. Maps to R2, R6. **TBD**: ER plan approval requirements.

### Phase 2: Field Testing Execution (During Fill Placement)

5. As fill placement proceeds per DEL-02.07 (Method Statement), perform field density tests at specified frequency and locations per approved plan. Ensure equipment calibrated and technicians qualified. Maps to R3, R8. Reference `Guidance.md` Real-Time Compliance Monitoring.
6. Document each test on field forms: location, date, test method, field dry density, field moisture, laboratory reference (max density, optimum moisture), percent compaction calculated, pass/fail vs. acceptance criteria. Maps to R3. Real-time documentation per DEL-02.06 approach.
7. **Pass/Fail Determination**: If test passes acceptance criteria, continue production. If test fails, immediately implement nonconformance procedure per plan: identify extent of deficient area, notify construction crew, implement corrective action (additional compaction, moisture adjustment, material replacement), document corrective action, retest to verify compliance. Maps to R4, R10. Reference `Guidance.md` Proactive Nonconformance Resolution.
8. Document all nonconformances: failed test location/results, root cause analysis, corrective action performed, retest results, closure approval. Track nonconformances to closure. Maps to R4, R10.

### Phase 3: Results Compilation and Final Acceptance

9. Compile test results progressively: field density test records, trial compaction results (if performed), proof rolling results (if part of compaction verification). Create test location plan showing all test locations on fill placement area plan. Maps to R3.
10. Prepare statistical summary: number of tests, pass rate, average percent compaction, range, organized by fill zone or material type. Maps to R3. Demonstrates statistical compliance per `Guidance.md`.
11. Verify all fill areas tested per frequency requirement; verify all nonconformances closed with approved corrective action and passing retests. Maps to R4, R5, R10.
12. Prepare final acceptance summary confirming all fill areas meet acceptance criteria, all nonconformances closed, fill placement acceptable. Maps to R1, R4.
13. Perform verification per V1–V3; obtain QA/QC manager and geotechnical engineer approval; submit results package to Employer for acceptance. Maps to R6. **ASSUMPTION**: D&B submittal workflow.

    ## Verification

    - **V1 Check (R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R8)**: Verify plan includes all required content per `Datasheet.md` (objectives, acceptance criteria, reference values, methods, frequency, trial compaction if required, equipment/personnel qualifications, nonconformance procedure, approval workflow). Verify results include field tests, test location plan, statistical summary, nonconformance documentation with closure. Verify document control elements complete. Verify testing performed per approved methods by qualified technicians. Records: Review checklist, approval signatures.
    - **V2 Check (R1, R3, R4, R5, R7, R9, R10)**: Verify testing covers all PKG-02 fill areas per frequency requirement; verify acceptance criteria consistent with DEL-02.02/DEL-02.04; verify trial compaction performed if required and demonstrated methodology effectiveness; verify all test results meet acceptance criteria or nonconformances closed. Create coverage matrix showing fill zones vs. tests performed. Records: Test coverage matrix, nonconformance closure log.
    - **V3 Check (R1, R8, R9)**: Verify ER compliance (compaction requirements, testing methods/frequency, trial compaction requirements, plan approval, results acceptance) once ER available. Records: ER compliance matrix, Employer plan approval, Employer results acceptance.
