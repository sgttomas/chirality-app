## Steps

### Phase 1: Compaction Verification Plan Development

| Step | Action | Requirements | Guidance | Inputs | Outputs |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Review ER compaction requirements, DEL-02.02 (Specifications — acceptance criteria), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports — Proctor values), DEL-02.08 (Testing Program — methods/frequency) to understand acceptance criteria and testing requirements; identify fill areas from DEL-02.01 | R1, R2, R5, R7, R8 | P1, P4, C3 | ER volumes, DEL-02.01, DEL-02.02, DEL-02.04, DEL-02.08 | Understanding of requirements; **TBD** until ER provided |
| 2 | Develop compaction verification plan per Datasheet Plan items 1-10: Define objectives/scope (fill zones, volumes, materials); document acceptance criteria (% Proctor per DEL-02.02/DEL-02.04); document laboratory reference values (Proctor results from DEL-02.08); specify field testing methods (ASTM D6938 nuclear gauge, ASTM D1556 sand cone); define testing frequency/locations (per DEL-02.08 and ER); define trial compaction requirements (if specified); document equipment calibration requirements (annual per ASTM); document technician qualifications (certified operators); define nonconformance procedure; define approval workflow | R2, R7, R8 | P1, C1-C5 | Step 1 outputs | Draft compaction verification plan |
| 3 | If trial compaction required per ER or geotechnical engineer recommendation: Coordinate with construction team to establish trial area; perform trial compaction with proposed equipment/methodology; document trial results; optimize lift thickness and compaction effort; verify methodology achieves acceptance criteria | R9 | C1, T1 | Draft plan, equipment, trial area | Trial compaction results; **TBD** if trial required |
| 4 | Obtain internal approvals (QA/QC manager, geotechnical engineer) for plan; submit plan to Employer for review/approval if required by ER; incorporate review comments; issue approved plan before fill placement | R2, R6 | P1, T3 | Completed plan | Approved plan; **TBD** ER plan approval requirements |

### Phase 2: Field Testing Execution (During Fill Placement)

| Step | Action | Requirements | Guidance | Inputs | Outputs |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 5 | As fill placement proceeds per DEL-02.07 (Method Statement), perform field density tests at specified frequency and locations per approved plan; ensure equipment calibrated (nuclear gauge daily standardization, annual calibration) and technicians qualified (certified operators) | R3, R8 | P2, C2, C5 | Approved plan, calibrated equipment, qualified technicians | Field density test data |
| 6 | Document each test on field forms per Datasheet Test Results item 1: Location (grid coordinates, fill zone), date, test method, field dry density, field moisture content, laboratory reference (max density, optimum moisture from Proctor), percent compaction calculated, pass/fail vs. acceptance criteria; real-time documentation per DEL-02.06 approach | R3 | P2 | Test data | Completed test forms |
| 7 | **Pass/Fail Determination**: If test passes acceptance criteria, continue production. If test fails: Immediately implement nonconformance procedure per plan — identify extent of deficient area, notify construction crew, implement corrective action (additional compaction passes, moisture adjustment, material replacement as appropriate), document corrective action, retest to verify compliance | R4, R10 | P3, T2 | Test results, nonconformance procedure | Corrective action, retest results |
| 8 | Document all nonconformances per Datasheet Nonconformance items 1-5: Failed test location/results, root cause analysis (inadequate compaction effort, moisture deviation, material issue), corrective action performed, retest results, closure approval (QA/QC manager or geotechnical engineer); track nonconformances to closure | R4, R10 | P3 | Nonconformance data | Nonconformance reports, closure documentation |

### Phase 3: Results Compilation and Final Acceptance

| Step | Action | Requirements | Guidance | Inputs | Outputs |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 9 | Compile test results progressively per Datasheet Test Results items 1-5: Field density test records (all tests from Steps 5-6), trial compaction results (if performed in Step 3), proof rolling results (if part of verification per plan); create test location plan showing all test locations overlaid on fill placement area plan from DEL-02.01 | R3 | P2, P4 | All test forms, drawings | Compiled test results, test location plan |
| 10 | Prepare statistical summary per Datasheet Test Results item 4: Number of tests, pass rate (first-time and including retests), average percent compaction, range (min/max), organized by fill zone or material type; statistical summary demonstrates consistent compliance across all fill areas | R3 | P4 | Compiled test data | Statistical summary |
| 11 | Verify coverage and closure per R5 and R10: Confirm all fill areas tested per frequency requirement (create coverage matrix: fill zones vs. tests performed); verify all nonconformances closed with approved corrective action and passing retests (nonconformance closure log) | R4, R5, R10 | P3, P4 | Test location plan, nonconformance log | Coverage verification, closure verification |
| 12 | Prepare final acceptance summary per Datasheet Nonconformance item 6: Confirm all fill areas meet acceptance criteria, all nonconformances closed, fill placement acceptable; compile complete record package with document control elements per R6 (record package ID, date range, location/area, testing methods, acceptance criteria, revision) | R1, R4, R6 | P3 | All results, closure verification | Final acceptance summary, record package |
| 13 | Perform verification per V1-V3: V1 content completeness check (all plan and results elements present, testing per approved methods); V2 scope and acceptance alignment check (all areas covered, criteria consistent with design, NCRs closed); V3 ER compliance check (once ER available); obtain QA/QC manager and geotechnical engineer approval; submit results package to Employer for acceptance | R1-R10 | P1, P3, P4 | Complete record package, V1-V3 criteria | Approved results package, Employer acceptance |
