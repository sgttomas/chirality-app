    ## Context & Conditions

    - PKG-02 scope includes Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).
    - This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
    - Deliverable intent: Defines the execution method and controls for earthworks excavation and fill placement to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements; provides clear instruction for field crews. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02 entries (location TBD).
    - Operating/environmental details: **TBD** (references not yet provided; ER will define site constraints, environmental restrictions, safety requirements, weather limitations for earthworks).
    - **ASSUMPTION**: Method statement prepared before construction start; updated as needed based on field conditions or design changes.
    - Coordination with DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings – design grades/limits), DEL-02.02 (Specifications – material requirements, compaction criteria), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – excavation/fill recommendations), DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program – QA/QC protocols), DEL-02.09 (Compaction Verification Plan – compaction methodology).

    ## Procedure Content

    **Excavation Method Statement:**
    - Excavation scope and limits (areas, depths, volumes)
    - Excavation equipment and methods (backhoe, excavator, dozer, mass excavation vs. structural excavation)
    - Excavation sequence and phasing (areas to be excavated first, staging)
    - Slope stability and shoring requirements (temporary slopes, excavation support systems if required)
    - Dewatering requirements (if groundwater encountered, pumping/drainage methods)
    - Excavated material handling (stockpile locations, material segregation by type/suitability for reuse, haul routes)
    - Utility protection measures (locate, expose, support existing utilities)
    - Safety requirements (excavation permits, shoring, confined space, protective systems per OSHA or local regulations)
    - Inspection and acceptance criteria (subgrade bearing verification, dimensional checks)

    **Fill Placement and Lift Thickness Procedure:**
    - Fill material sources and suitability criteria (on-site excavated material, imported fill, specifications per DEL-02.02)
    - Fill material testing requirements (classification, compaction parameters from DEL-02.04)
    - Fill placement sequence and limits (areas, layers, total depths)
    - Lift thickness specifications (maximum lift thickness for achieving compaction, typically 150-300 mm depending on equipment and soil type)
    - Moisture conditioning (wetting or drying to achieve optimum moisture content range)
    - Compaction equipment and methods (vibratory roller, sheepsfoot roller, plate compactor; number of passes)
    - Compaction acceptance criteria (percent compaction per DEL-02.02, testing frequency per DEL-02.08)
    - Quality control during placement (visual inspections, density testing per DEL-02.06)
    - Weather constraints (no placement during rain, freezing conditions, moisture limits)

    **Material Handling Procedure:**
    - Material flow plan (excavation to stockpile to placement, haul routes, traffic control)
    - Excavated material segregation (suitable for reuse vs. unsuitable/waste, topsoil stripping and stockpiling)
    - Stockpile management (locations, erosion control, protection from contamination)
    - Import material delivery (sources, material acceptance testing, delivery scheduling)
    - Export/disposal of unsuitable material (off-site disposal locations, waste classification if applicable)
    - Dust control and erosion control measures (watering, silt fencing, sediment traps)
    - Environmental controls (contaminated soil handling if encountered, spill prevention)

    **Configuration notes:**

    - **TBD** (details require ER volumes and design inputs; ER will specify environmental restrictions, safety requirements, material acceptance criteria, construction constraints).
    - Method statement shall be site-specific and reference project drawings (DEL-02.01), specifications (DEL-02.02), and geotechnical recommendations (DEL-02.04).
    - Procedure format may include text, diagrams, photos, equipment lists, checklists to enhance clarity for field personnel.
    - Coordination with safety plan, environmental management plan, and traffic management plan (if applicable).

    ## Cross-document notes

    - The Requirements section in `Specification.md` (R1–R10) is the primary source of requirements references for this Datasheet.
    - Guidance principles in `Guidance.md` expand on how clarity, safety, quality control, and adaptability influence method statement effectiveness.
    - Procedure steps in `Procedure.md` describe the process for developing, reviewing, approving, and implementing the method statement in field operations.
    - Verification items in `Specification.md` (V1–V3) map to method statement completeness checks, technical adequacy review, and ER compliance verification.
