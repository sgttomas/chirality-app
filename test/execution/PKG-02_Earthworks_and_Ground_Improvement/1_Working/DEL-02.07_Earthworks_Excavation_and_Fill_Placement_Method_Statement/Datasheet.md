## Context & Conditions

**Project Context:**
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Contract type: Design & Build. Source: decomposition Section 1 (location TBD).
- Package scope: Site grading, excavation, filling, ground improvements, geotechnical works, surveys. Source: decomposition PKG-02 scope (location TBD).

**Scope Boundaries:**
- This decomposition covers the Contractor's scope of work only. Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer, nitrogen skid supply) are excluded except for interface connections. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).
- Deliverable intent: Defines the execution method and controls for earthworks excavation and fill placement to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements; provides clear instruction for field crews. Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.07 entry (location TBD).

**Environmental/Operational Context:**
- Operating/environmental details: **TBD** — pending ER volumes; ER will define site constraints, environmental restrictions, safety requirements, weather limitations for earthworks.
- **ASSUMPTION**: Method statement prepared before construction start; updated as needed based on field conditions or design changes.

**Interface Coordination:**
- DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings): Design grades, excavation limits, fill placement limits.
- DEL-02.02 (Technical Specification): Material requirements, compaction criteria, acceptance standards.
- DEL-02.03 (Design Calculations): Cut/fill volumes, bearing capacity requirements.
- DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports): Soil conditions, excavation/fill recommendations, groundwater levels.
- DEL-02.05 (Survey Reports): Existing utilities, site survey data.
- DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program): QA/QC testing protocols, testing frequencies.
- DEL-02.09 (Compaction Verification Plan): Compaction testing methodology.
