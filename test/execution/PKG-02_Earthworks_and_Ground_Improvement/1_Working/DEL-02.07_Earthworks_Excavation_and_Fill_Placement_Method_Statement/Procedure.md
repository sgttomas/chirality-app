    ## Steps

### Phase 1: Information Gathering and Analysis

1. Review ER safety/environmental/approval requirements, DEL-02.01 (Earthworks Drawings), DEL-02.02 (Specifications), DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports – soil conditions, excavation/fill recommendations), DEL-02.05 (Survey Reports – existing utilities), and DEL-02.08 (Sampling & Testing Program) to understand scope, design requirements, site conditions, and constraints. **TBD** until ER references are provided. Maps to R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R7.
2. Identify site-specific conditions affecting excavation and fill placement: soil types and properties, groundwater levels, existing utilities, adjacent structures/work, access constraints, environmental sensitive areas, seasonal/weather considerations. Reference `Guidance.md` Site-Specific Adaptation and weather/utility/dewatering considerations. Maps to R2, R3, R4. Update `Datasheet.md` Site-Specific Conditions attribute.
3. Coordinate with project safety manager to identify safety requirements (OSHA excavation/trenching standards, shoring, confined space, protective systems) and with environmental coordinator to identify environmental controls (erosion/sediment control, dust suppression, contaminated soil protocols, permit conditions). Maps to R8, R9. **TBD**: ER will specify safety/environmental requirements.
4. Assess equipment availability and suitability for site conditions; identify excavation equipment, compaction equipment, haul trucks, dewatering equipment (if needed), utility protection materials. Reference `Guidance.md` Equipment Selection considerations. **ASSUMPTION**: Contractor equipment resources or rental sources identified.

### Phase 2: Method Statement Content Development

5. **Develop Excavation Method Statement** per `Datasheet.md` Excavation Method Statement content structure: Define excavation scope/limits (areas, depths, volumes from DEL-02.01/DEL-02.03), select equipment and methods (mass excavation vs. structural excavation, backhoe vs. excavator), define sequencing/phasing, specify slope stability/shoring requirements (reference DEL-02.04 soil strength; comply with OSHA slope requirements or engineered shoring), define dewatering approach if groundwater anticipated (reference DEL-02.04 hydrogeology), define excavated material handling (stockpile locations, segregation by suitability per DEL-02.04, haul routes), specify utility protection measures (locate/expose/support per DEL-02.05), define safety requirements (permits, protective systems per R8), define inspection/acceptance criteria (subgrade bearing, dimensions). Maps to R2, R7, R8. Reference `Guidance.md` considerations on excavation slope stability, dewatering, utility protection.
6. **Develop Fill Placement and Lift Thickness Procedure** per `Datasheet.md` Fill Placement and Lift Thickness Procedure content structure: Define fill material sources and suitability criteria (on-site excavated material per DEL-02.04 suitability, imported fill specifications per DEL-02.02), define fill material testing requirements (classification, Proctor tests per DEL-02.08), define placement sequence/limits (areas, layers, depths from DEL-02.01), specify lift thickness (maximum thickness for achieving compaction, typically 150-300 mm depending on equipment and soil type per DEL-02.04 recommendations), define moisture conditioning procedures (wetting/drying to achieve optimum moisture range), specify compaction equipment and methods (roller type, number of passes to achieve criteria from DEL-02.02), define acceptance criteria (percent compaction per DEL-02.02, testing frequency per DEL-02.08), define quality control procedures (visual inspection, density testing per DEL-02.06), define weather constraints (no placement during rain/freezing). Maps to R3, R7. Reference `Guidance.md` considerations on lift thickness/compaction optimization, material suitability, weather constraints.
7. **Develop Material Handling Procedure** per `Datasheet.md` Material Handling Procedure content structure: Define material flow plan (excavation to stockpile to placement or direct placement, haul routes, traffic control), define excavated material segregation (suitable for reuse vs. unsuitable/waste per DEL-02.04, topsoil stripping/stockpiling), define stockpile management (locations, erosion control, contamination protection), define import material delivery (sources, acceptance testing per DEL-02.08, scheduling), define export/disposal (off-site disposal locations, waste classification if applicable), define dust/erosion control measures (watering, silt fencing, sediment traps per environmental management plan), define environmental controls (contaminated soil handling if encountered, spill prevention). Maps to R4, R9. Reference `Guidance.md` considerations on material reuse, environmental controls.
8. Prepare method statement document per D&B Contractor procedure format; include document control elements (procedure number, revision, method statement ID, applicable scope, effective date) per R6. Use clear language, logical sequence, and visual aids (diagrams, photos, checklists) to enhance field usability per `Guidance.md` Clarity and Field Usability principle. Maps to R1, R6.
9. Reference project drawings (DEL-02.01), specifications (DEL-02.02), geotechnical recommendations (DEL-02.04), and related procedures (DEL-02.08, DEL-02.09) within method statement to ensure integration. Maps to R7. Update `Datasheet.md` Applicable Scope attribute.

### Phase 3: Review and Approval

10. Perform internal technical review against Specification verification items (V1: content completeness per R1–R10; V2: design compliance, PKG-02 scope coverage, field usability; V3: ER compliance). Engage construction manager, geotechnical engineer, safety manager, environmental coordinator, and QA/QC manager in review. Reference `Guidance.md` Trade-offs for balancing prescriptive detail vs. flexibility. Update `Datasheet.md` Configuration Notes to document any site-specific adaptations or **TBDs** requiring field resolution.
11. Address review comments; revise method statement as necessary. Update revision attribute in `Datasheet.md`.
12. Obtain D&B Contractor internal approvals: construction manager approval (construction feasibility), QA/QC manager approval (quality controls adequate), safety manager approval (safety requirements compliant), environmental coordinator approval (environmental controls adequate). Maps to R10. Document approvals and effective date in `Datasheet.md` Approval Status and Effective Date attributes.
13. If required by ER, submit method statement to Employer for review/approval before field implementation. **TBD**: ER will specify if method statement submittal required and approval process. Maps to R10. **ASSUMPTION**: Submittal per standard D&B document control workflow.
14. Obtain Employer approval (if required); address any Employer comments; update method statement and revision. **TBD**: ER approval timeline and process.

### Phase 4: Implementation and Field Update

15. Issue approved method statement to field construction crews, inspectors, safety personnel, and QA/QC team. Conduct pre-construction briefing to review method statement, safety requirements, quality control checkpoints, and environmental controls. Maps to R1. **ASSUMPTION**: Toolbox talk or pre-construction meeting per D&B safety and quality procedures.
16. Implement method statement during construction execution. Monitor field compliance with method statement; verify procedures followed for excavation, fill placement, material handling, safety, and environmental controls. **ASSUMPTION**: Construction supervision and inspection per method statement.
17. If site conditions differ from method statement assumptions (e.g., unexpected groundwater, unsuitable soil encountered, utility conflicts, weather delays), assess variance and determine if method statement update required or field adaptation within defined flexibility is acceptable. Reference `Guidance.md` Adaptability to Site Conditions principle. Document variances and field decisions. **ASSUMPTION**: Construction manager authority for minor field adaptations; major changes require method statement revision.
18. If method statement revision required (due to design changes, significant site condition variances, lessons learned from early construction), update method statement, obtain re-approval per steps 10-14, re-issue to field, and conduct update briefing. Update revision attribute in `Datasheet.md`. **ASSUMPTION**: Change control process per D&B procedures.
19. At project completion, archive approved method statement and field variance documentation per document control requirements for project closeout and lessons learned. Maps to R6. **ASSUMPTION**: D&B document retention policy.

Verify field usability (construction manager and field supervisor review for practicality). Method: Cross-reference method statement with design documents; create cross-reference matrix showing method statement elements vs. design requirements (excavation limits, fill specifications, compaction criteria, lift thickness, testing frequency); field supervisor review for clarity and constructability. Records: Design cross-reference matrix, field usability review comments.
    - **V3 Check (R1, R8, R9, R10 compliance)**: Verify alignment with ER requirements (safety regulations, environmental restrictions/permits, method statement submittal/approval process) once Employer's Requirements volumes are available. Confirm method statement addresses ER-specified safety measures, environmental controls, and constraints. Confirm Employer review/approval obtained if required by ER. Method: ER compliance review against specified safety/environmental/approval requirements; safety/environmental permit compliance check; verify submittal and approval per ER process.
