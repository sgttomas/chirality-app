# Guidance: DEL-02.07 Earthworks Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement

## Purpose

Provide guidance that keeps the Earthworks Excavation & Fill Placement Method Statement aligned with PKG-02 earthworks objectives, Specification requirements (R1-R10), and Procedure realization (Steps 1-19). Source: _CONTEXT.md; decomposition DEL-02.07 entry (location TBD).

## Principles

### P1: Clarity and Field Usability
Method statement must be clear, concise, and actionable for field crews; avoid overly technical language or excessive detail that obscures key instructions.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Construction efficiency and quality execution; field personnel may have varying technical backgrounds |
| Specification § | R1 |
| Datasheet mapping | Configuration Notes (format guidance) |
| Procedure Step | Step 8 |

### P2: Safety First
Safety requirements (excavation protection, shoring, confined space, utility protection) must be prominent and unambiguous; method statement is key tool for communicating and enforcing safety.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Regulatory compliance and project safety culture; safety incidents disrupt construction and cause harm |
| Specification § | R8, R9 |
| Datasheet mapping | Excavation Method Statement item 8, Material Handling items 6-7 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 3, 5, 7 |

### P3: Quality Control Integration
Method statement shall clearly define quality control checkpoints, acceptance criteria, and testing requirements to ensure work meets design specifications without rework.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Integrated quality management; prevention better than correction |
| Specification § | R1, R3 |
| Datasheet mapping | Fill Placement items 7-8 (acceptance criteria, QC) |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6, 10 |

### P4: Adaptability to Site Conditions
Method statement should provide framework for execution while allowing adaptation to encountered site conditions (e.g., unexpected groundwater, unsuitable soil); define decision points and escalation for variances.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Site conditions may differ from assumptions; rigid procedures can impede progress |
| Specification § | R2, R3, R6 |
| Datasheet mapping | Site-specific conditions attribute |
| Procedure Step | Steps 17-18 |

### P5: Coordination and Sequencing
Method statement shall address interfaces with adjacent/subsequent work (e.g., utility protection during excavation, subgrade acceptance before pavement) to prevent conflicts and delays.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Construction sequencing coordination |
| Specification § | R5, R7, R10 |
| Datasheet mapping | Interface Coordination list |
| Procedure Step | Steps 1, 9, 10-14 |

**Scope Boundary:** Interface-only connections to Employer responsibilities ensure the Contractor retains the defined scope. Source: decomposition Section 1.2 Scope Focus (location TBD).

## Considerations

### C1: Site-Specific Adaptation
Tailor method statement to actual site conditions (soil types, groundwater levels, access constraints, weather patterns) rather than generic approach; reference DEL-02.04 (Geotechnical Reports) and DEL-02.05 (Survey Reports) for site data.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Site-specific approach more effective than one-size-fits-all |
| Specification § | R2 |
| Datasheet mapping | Excavation Method Statement item 1 (scope/limits) |
| Procedure Step | Step 2 |

### C2: Equipment Selection and Availability
Specify equipment types and sizes appropriate for site access, soil conditions, and production rates; confirm equipment availability before finalizing method statement.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: Contractor's equipment resources and rental availability |
| Specification § | R2, R3 |
| Datasheet mapping | Excavation item 2, Fill Placement item 6 |
| Procedure Step | Step 4 |

### C3: Excavation Slope Stability and Shoring
Temporary excavation slopes must meet OSHA requirements (typically 1.5H:1V for Type C soil, flatter for weaker soils, or shoring/benching); deep/confined excavations may require engineered shoring. Reference DEL-02.04 for soil strength parameters.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: ER may specify additional excavation protection requirements |
| Specification § | R2, R8 |
| Datasheet mapping | Excavation Method Statement item 4 |
| Procedure Step | Step 5 |

### C4: Dewatering Planning
If groundwater encountered, dewatering method (sumps and pumps, wellpoints, deep wells) depends on flow rate, excavation depth/area, and duration; discharge may require permit.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: Site hydrogeology from DEL-02.04; environmental permit requirements from ER |
| Specification § | R2 |
| Datasheet mapping | Excavation Method Statement item 5 |
| Procedure Step | Step 5 |

### C5: Fill Material Suitability and Testing
Excavated material may or may not be suitable for reuse as structural fill; laboratory testing (classification, compaction parameters) required to determine suitability. Import material sources must be identified and tested before delivery.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **ASSUMPTION**: Material testing program established before fill placement; reference DEL-02.04 and DEL-02.08 |
| Specification § | R3 |
| Datasheet mapping | Fill Placement items 1-2, 4-5 |
| Procedure Step | Step 6 |

### C6: Utility Protection and Coordination
Existing utilities must be accurately located (DEL-02.05 utility locate), marked in field, exposed by hand digging or vacuum excavation, and protected/supported during adjacent excavation. Coordinate with utility owners for shutdown/relocation if required.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: ER will identify utility owners and coordination requirements |
| Specification § | R2 |
| Datasheet mapping | Excavation Method Statement item 7 |
| Procedure Step | Step 5 |

### C7: Weather and Seasonal Constraints
Wet weather can render excavation/fill placement impractical (muddy conditions, standing water, equipment bogging); freezing weather prevents proper compaction. Define weather shutdown criteria and seasonal work windows.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Basis | **TBD**: Site climate data; ER may specify weather limitations |
| Specification § | R3, R9 |
| Datasheet mapping | Fill Placement item 9 |
| Procedure Step | Steps 6, 17 |

## Requirement Traceability

| Requirement | Guidance Section | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| R1 (Execution methods and controls) | P1, P2, P3 | Method statement is primary tool for communicating construction approach to field crews, inspectors, safety personnel, and Employer; must be comprehensive yet understandable |
| R2 (Excavation method statement) | P2, P4, C1-C4, C6 | Excavation poses significant safety risks (cave-ins, utility strikes) and quality risks (over-excavation, subgrade disturbance); method statement must clearly address protection measures and controls |
| R3 (Fill placement and lift thickness) | P3, P4, C5, C7, T1 | Systematic fill placement is critical for achieving compaction and preventing settlement; lift thickness and compaction methodology must be clearly specified for field crews and inspectors |
| R4 (Material handling) | P2, T2 | Efficient material flow (excavation to stockpile to placement or direct placement) affects schedule and cost; material segregation (suitable vs. unsuitable) affects fill quality and export volumes |
| R5 (PKG-02 scope coverage) | P3, P5 | Ensures method statement addresses all earthworks areas and activities; gaps can lead to uncontrolled work or quality deficiencies |
| R6 (Document control) | P4 | Revision control important as method statement may be updated based on site conditions, design changes, or lessons learned during construction |
| R7 (Design compliance) | P3, P5 | Method statement must implement design intent from drawings, specifications, and geotechnical recommendations; disconnect between design and execution causes non-conformances |
| R8 (Safety requirements) | P2, C3 | Method statement is key document for safety plan implementation; regulatory compliance (e.g., OSHA) is mandatory and safety culture is essential |
| R9 (Environmental controls) | P2, C7 | Earthworks can cause erosion, sediment discharge, dust, contamination exposure if not controlled; environmental permits and management plan must be implemented |
| R10 (Approval workflow) | P5 | Method statement approval by construction manager, QA/QC, and potentially Employer ensures buy-in and technical adequacy before field execution |

## Trade-offs

### T1: Prescriptive Detail vs. Field Flexibility
Highly detailed method statement provides clear instruction but may be too rigid if site conditions vary; general method statement provides flexibility but may lack clarity for field crews.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Provide prescriptive detail for safety-critical items (excavation protection, utility clearances) and quality-critical items (lift thickness, compaction criteria); allow flexibility for production methods (equipment selection, haul routes) within defined constraints |
| Specification § | R1, R2, R3 |
| Datasheet mapping | All Procedure Content tables |
| Procedure Step | Steps 5-8, 17 |

### T2: On-Site Material Reuse vs. Import/Export
Reusing excavated material as fill minimizes import cost and export/disposal cost but requires testing, segregation, and stockpile management; importing select fill and exporting all excavated material simplifies logistics but increases cost.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Evaluate material suitability per DEL-02.04; balance cost of testing/management vs. cost of import/export; consider environmental benefit of reuse vs. disposal |
| Specification § | R4 |
| Datasheet mapping | Material Handling items 1-5 |
| Procedure Step | Step 7 |

### T3: Comprehensive Development vs. Schedule
Comprehensive method statement development takes time before construction can start; abbreviated method statement allows faster start but may have gaps requiring field resolution.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Guidance | Use Specification verification approach (V1-V3) and Procedure steps to define minimum content; develop method statement in parallel with design completion; update progressively as design details finalized; prioritize early-work areas for initial method statement |
| Specification § | R1, R6 |
| Datasheet mapping | Configuration Notes |
| Procedure Step | Steps 1-9, 18 |
