## Dependency Discovery Metadata
- Analyzed: 2026-01-29 07:10
- Analyzer: DEPENDENCY_DISCOVERY
- Content State: INITIALIZED
- Confidence: HIGH (explicit prerequisites in Procedure)

## Notes
- Upgraded from NOT_TRACKED to DECLARED
- DEL-02.07 is the execution procedure for field earthworks construction
- Consumes design deliverables (drawings, specs, calcs, geotech, survey) to produce field-executable method
- Generates DEL-02.06 records during execution (PR relationship)
