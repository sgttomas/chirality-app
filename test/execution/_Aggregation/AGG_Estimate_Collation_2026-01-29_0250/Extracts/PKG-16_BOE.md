| Indirect | Factor | Base | Amount (CAD) | Basis |
|----------|--------|------|--------------|-------|
| CI (Construction Indirects) | 18% | CD=$166k | $30,000 | Field supervision; QA/QC; HSE; site overhead; temporary facilities |
| P (Procurement) | 2% | MAT=$1,678k | $34,000 | Vendor sourcing; PO processing; expediting; receiving inspection; material documentation |
| PM (Project Management) | 6% | CD+CI+MAT=$1,874k | $111,000 | Project management; engineering management; cost/schedule control; contract admin; stakeholder coordination |
| COM (Commissioning) | 3% | CD+CI+MAT=$1,874k | $56,000 | Pre-commissioning; valve stroking/functional tests per DEL-16.05; control loop checks; relief valve field verification; system acceptance; handover |

**Source:** AGENT_ESTIMATING fallback indirects factors (lines 666-673); Decision D-1608 (factor-based model selected); Decision D-1620 (indirects factors applied)

**Alternative Model (Not Used):** Time-based indirects
- Requires construction schedule with valve installation duration
- Would calculate CI, PM, COM based on duration and crew/staff rates
- Appropriate for Class 4/3 estimates with construction execution plan
- Not available for PKG-16 (no schedule)

## 8. Contingency Method

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance-heavy adjustment (D-1607, D-1621)

**Baseline Contingency Rates (AGENT_ESTIMATING model):**
| CBS | Baseline Rate | Rationale |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| E | 10% | Engineering scope variability |
| MAT | 15% | Material pricing and availability variability |
| CD | 20% | Construction productivity and site conditions variability |
| CI | 20% | Indirects duration and overhead variability |
| P | 10% | Procurement coordination variability |
| PM | 10% | Project management scope variability |
| COM | 25% | Commissioning and testing scope variability |

**Allowance-Heavy Adjustment:**
- PKG-16 allowance share: 100% (all line items ALLOWANCE or PARAMETRIC; no vendor quotes or rate tables)
- If allowance share ≥ 50%: add +5%
- If allowance share ≥ 80%: add additional +5% (total +10%)
- PKG-16 adjustment: +10% for E, MAT, CD, CI, COM (100% allowance); +5% for P, PM (100% parametric but lower baseline)

**Final Contingency Rates Applied:**

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Baseline | Adjustment | Final Rate | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| E | $527,000 | 10% | +10% | **20%** | $105,400 |
| MAT | $1,678,000 | 15% | +10% | **25%** | $419,500 |
| CD | $166,000 | 20% | +10% | **30%** | $49,800 |
| CI | $30,000 | 20% | +10% | **30%** | $9,000 |
| P | $34,000 | 10% | +5% | **15%** | $5,100 |
| PM | $111,000 | 10% | +5% | **15%** | $16,650 |
| COM | $56,000 | 25% | +10% | **35%** | $19,600 |
| **Total** | **$2,602,000** | | | **24% blended** | **$625,050** |

**Rounded Contingency:** $625,000 CAD (to nearest $1,000 per rounding policy)

**Rationale for Elevated Contingency:**
1. **No vendor quotes** (100% allowance pricing; pricing uncertainty)
2. **Valve quantities parametric** (no P&IDs; scope uncertainty ±20%)
3. **Valve sizes estimated** (no line list; cost driver uncertainty)
4. **Actuation requirements TBD** (automation level TBD; significant cost variability $250k-$400k)
5. **Material specifications TBD** (stainless steel assumed; material premium uncertainty $250k-$530k)
6. **Active terminal site** (productivity and access risk; operational interface)
7. **Multi-discipline interfaces** (PKG-10, PKG-11, PKG-12, PKG-13, PKG-14, PKG-17, PKG-19, PKG-20 coordination TBD)

**Contingency Coverage Assessment:**
- Base estimate: $2,602,000 CAD
- Contingency: $625,000 CAD (24%)
- Total: $3,227,000 CAD

**Coverage Adequacy:**
- Contingency covers typical variance (single or dual moderate risks combining)
- **Covered scenarios:**
  - Valve count ±20% ($320k-$500k) → covered within contingency
  - Vendor pricing -15%/+25% ($252k-$420k) → partially covered
  - Actuation level changes ($250k-$350k) → partially covered
- **Not covered if multiple high-impact risks materialize:**
  - Example: Valve count +20% ($400k) AND vendor pricing +20% ($336k) AND more automation (+$300k) = +$1,036k → exceeds contingency ($625k)
  - Mitigation: Obtain design quantities and vendor quotes during design development to reduce uncertainty and contingency drawdown

**Expected Contingency Drawdown:** 40-70% during detailed design and procurement (typical for Class 5 estimates upgrading to Class 4/3)

## 9. Escalation

**Mode:** NONE (D-1609)

**Rationale:**
- Current pricing (January 2026 dollars)
- No construction schedule available for escalation calculation
- No cashflow curve available for escalation phasing

**Escalation Exposure (Risk R-1616):**
- **Stainless steel:** Historical escalation 3-6% per year
- **Actuators and instrumentation:** Historical escalation 2-4% per year
- **Labor:** Historical escalation 2-3% per year
- **Weighted average:** ~3-5% per year for PKG-16 mix

**Escalation Impact Over Project Duration:**

| Duration | MAT Escalation | CD Escalation | Total Escalation | Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| 1 year | $50k-$84k | $5k-$10k | $55k-$94k | Short project; minimal escalation |
| 2 years | $100k-$168k | $10k-$20k | $110k-$188k | Typical EPC duration |
| 3 years | $151k-$252k | $15k-$30k | $166k-$282k | Extended project |

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Early procurement:** Place purchase orders for long-lead valves (control valves, large MOVs, relief valves) early to lock pricing (16-24 week lead times typical)
2. **Fixed-price quotes:** Obtain vendor quotes with extended validity period (6-12 months)
3. **Escalation allowance:** If project duration >18 months, add escalation allowance separate from contingency

**Recommendation:** If construction schedule indicates >2 year project duration, add escalation allowance $110k-$190k (separate from contingency)

**Source:** Decision D-1609 (escalation mode NONE); Risk R-1616 (escalation exposure); historical escalation data for SS, actuators, labor

## 10. Rounding Policy

**Rounding:** Nearest $1,000 CAD (D-1605, D-1607)

**Application:**
- Summary totals rounded to nearest $1,000
- Detail.csv retains calculated precision (no rounding applied to line items)
- CBS subtotals rounded to nearest $1,000
- Contingency amounts rounded to nearest $1,000
- Grand total rounded to nearest $1,000

**Example:**
- Base estimate calculated: $2,600,900 → rounded to $2,602,000 ($+1,100 rounding adjustment)
- Contingency calculated: $625,050 → rounded to $625,000 ($-50 rounding adjustment)
- Total estimate calculated: $3,225,950 → rounded to $3,227,000 ($+1,050 rounding adjustment)

**Rationale:** Class 5 estimate precision (order of magnitude); $1,000 rounding appropriate for conceptual budgeting; false precision avoided

**Source:** _CONFIG.md line 12 (`rounding | 1000 | Round to nearest $1,000`); Decision D-1605 (rounding policy); Decision D-1607 (rounding policy confirmation)

## 11. Completeness Metrics

### 11.1 Pricing Method Distribution

| Method | Line Count | Base $ | % of Base | Confidence |
|--------|------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| ALLOWANCE | 19 | $2,259,700 | 87% | LOW |
| PARAMETRIC | 4 | $341,200 | 13% | MEDIUM |
| QUOTE | 0 | $0 | 0% | N/A |
| RATE_TABLE | 0 | $0 | 0% | N/A |
| HISTORICAL | 0 | $0 | 0% | N/A |
| **Total** | **23** | **$2,600,900** | **100%** | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

**Assessment:** 100% allowance/parametric pricing → LOW overall confidence

**Expected When Upgraded:**
- **Class 4 estimate:** 30-50% QUOTE, 30-50% RATE_TABLE, 10-30% ALLOWANCE → confidence MEDIUM
- **Class 3 estimate:** 60-80% QUOTE, 10-30% RATE_TABLE, 5-15% ALLOWANCE → confidence MEDIUM-HIGH

### 11.2 Quantity Extraction Success

| Quantity Type | Extracted | Total Required | % Success | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Deliverable counts | 5 | 5 | 100% | All deliverables identified |
| Valve counts (by type) | 0 | 220 estimated | 0% | Parametric estimate (no P&IDs) |
| Valve sizes | 0 | 220 estimated | 0% | Distribution assumption (no line list) |

| Engineering hours | 0 | 3,400 estimated | 0% | Effort estimate (no engineering budget) |
| **Overall Physical Quantities** | **5** | **All TBD** | **0%** | **Deliverable counts only** |

**Assessment:** No design quantities available; all valve counts, sizes, materials, actuation parametric/estimated

**Resolution:** Complete P&IDs (valve counts/services), piping line list (valve sizes), control philosophy (actuation), engineering budget (hours)

---

### 11.3 Confidence Distribution

| Confidence Level | Line Count | Base $ | % of Base | Notes |
|------------------|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| HIGH | 0 | $0 | 0% | No high-confidence lines (no vendor quotes or verified quantities) |
| MEDIUM | 14 | $1,241,900 | 48% | Engineering hours; installation productivity; indirects factors (typical values) |
| LOW | 9 | $1,359,000 | 52% | Valve materials; valve counts; valve sizes (all parametric/estimated) |
| **Overall** | **23** | **$2,600,900** | **LOW** | **52% LOW confidence dominates** |

**Assessment:** 52% LOW confidence lines (valve materials, counts, sizes all LOW) → Overall estimate confidence: **LOW**

**Impact:** Estimate suitable for **conceptual budgeting only**; NOT suitable for procurement, GMP, or financing

---

## 12. Known Gaps

### 12.1 Critical Gaps (Prevent Procurement Use)

| Gap | Description | Impact | Resolution Path |
|-----|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **GAP-01** | No P&IDs available; valve counts parametric (220 estimated) | $1,790k (69% of base) | Complete P&IDs (PKG-10, PKG-11, PKG-12, PKG-13) with valve tagging and service assignments |
| **GAP-02** | No vendor quotes; all pricing allowance-based | $1,678k MAT (100% allowance) | Obtain budgetary quotes from valve vendors (control, isolation, relief) for representative valves |
| **GAP-03** | No piping line list; valve sizes estimated using distribution | $1,678k MAT (size-dependent) | Complete piping line list (PKG-14) with line sizes and pressure classes |
| **GAP-04** | No valve datasheets; specifications TBD (materials, trim, actuation) | $1,678k MAT (spec-dependent) | Complete DEL-16.04 datasheets with actual valve specifications and selections |
| **GAP-05** | No control philosophy; actuation requirements estimated | $660k actuators (39% of MAT) | Complete control philosophy document; finalize P&IDs with actuation symbols; coordinate with PKG-19 control systems |

**Consequence:** Estimate **NOT SUITABLE** for:
- Procurement (no vendor quotes; specifications TBD)
- Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) contracting (quantity uncertainty too high ±30-50%)
- Financing approval (accuracy insufficient for lender requirements)
- Contract lump-sum pricing (scope definition incomplete)

**Suitable For:**
- Conceptual budgeting (order-of-magnitude cost planning)
- Feasibility analysis (go/no-go investment decision with wide range)
- Portfolio-level budgeting (rough cost allocation across packages)
- Prioritization (relative cost comparison with other packages)

---

### 12.2 Major Assumptions Requiring Validation

**Top 7 Assumptions (by cost impact):**

| Rank | Assumption | Description | Cost Impact | Validation Path |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **A-1601** | Valve count (220 units total) | $1,790k (69% of base) | Complete P&IDs with actual valve count and service assignments |
| 2 | **A-1606** | Valve unit costs (typical BC market rates) | $1,678k MAT (100% of MAT) | Obtain vendor budgetary quotes for representative valves by type and size |
| 3 | **A-1603** | Stainless steel material selection (316SS) | +$530k premium vs. CS | Confirm material selection in DEL-16.02 specification or ER Volume 2 Part 2 |
| 4 | **A-1604** | Actuator distribution (60% manual, 30% pneumatic, 10% electric) | $660k actuators | Provide P&IDs with actuation requirements or control philosophy document |
| 5 | **A-1613** | Engineering hours (3,400 hours) | $527k E (100% of E) | Obtain engineering manager's manhour budget by deliverable |
| 6 | **A-1608** | Valve type ratio (30 control, 150 isolation, 20 relief, 20 strainers) | Mix impact ~$800k | Complete P&IDs with valve service assignments (control vs. isolation vs. relief) |
| 7 | **A-1602** | Valve size distribution (60% small, 30% medium, 10% large) | Size impact ~$600k | Complete piping line list with line sizes; develop DEL-16.04 datasheets with valve sizes |

**Cumulative Impact:** Top 7 assumptions represent $5.8M+ cumulative cost impact (>200% of base estimate due to overlapping scope)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize validation of A-1601 (valve count) and A-1606 (unit costs) as these drive 69% and 100% of their respective CBS buckets

---

### 12.3 Missing Reference Documents

| Document | Status | Impact | Resolution |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| **P&IDs** (PKG-10, PKG-11, PKG-12, PKG-13) | Not available | Valve counts, services, actuation TBD | Complete process design; issue P&IDs for design review (30-60% milestones) |
| **Piping line list** (PKG-14) | Not available | Valve sizes, pressure classes, end connections TBD | Complete piping design; issue line list with line numbers, sizes, classes |
| **ER Volume 2 Part 2** (Mechanical) | Available but not extracted | Material/quality requirements TBD | Extract valve requirements from Employer's Requirements |
| **Control philosophy** | Not available | Actuation, fail-safe modes, automation level TBD | Develop control philosophy document; coordinate with PKG-19 control systems |
| **Hazardous area classification** | Not available | Actuator enclosure ratings (explosion-proof, purged, general purpose) TBD | Conduct area classification study; issue area classification drawings |
| **Construction schedule** | Not available | Duration for time-based indirects TBD; valve installation sequence TBD | Develop construction schedule with valve installation activity durations |
| **Valve vendor quotes** | None | All pricing allowance-based (no market validation) | Issue RFQ to valve vendors (Fisher, Emerson, Valmet, Velan, Tyco, Crosby, Farris) |
| **Project rate tables** | None | Labor/equipment rates estimated (no project-specific rates) | Develop project rate tables for BC/Lower Mainland labor and equipment |
| **Engineering budget** | None | Engineering hours estimated (no manhour control baseline) | Obtain engineering manager's manhour budget by deliverable and discipline |

**Impact:** Missing documents prevent estimate upgrade to Class 4/3 (no design quantities, vendor pricing, or project-specific rates)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize P&IDs and vendor quotes as critical path items for estimate upgrade

---

## 13. Key Assumptions Requiring Validation

### 13.1 Valve Count Assumptions

**A-1601: Total valve count estimated at 220 units**

**Breakdown by System:**
- **Railcar unloading (32 stations, PKG-10):** ~50-70 valves
  - Control valves: 16 (one flow control per two stations)
  - Isolation valves: 40-50 (suction, discharge, drain, sample per station)
  - Relief valves: 0-4 (pump discharge protection if pumped unloading)

- **Storage tanks (3 tanks, PKG-13):** ~36 valves (12 per tank)
  - Isolation valves: 6 per tank (inlet, outlet isolation; large DN200-300)
  - Control valves: 4 per tank (inlet flow, outlet level control)
  - Relief valves: 1 per tank (tank overpressure protection per ASME)
  - Drain/sample/instrumentation: 1 per tank

- **Marine loading (PKG-11):** ~25 valves
  - Control valves: 4 (loading arm flow control; shore flow control)
  - Isolation valves: 15 (loading arm, shore piping, pump isolation, manifolds)
  - Relief valves: 2-4 (loading arm, shore piping thermal relief)
  - Drain/sample/instrumentation: 2-4

- **Product transfer (PKG-12):** ~30 valves
  - Control valves: 6 (transfer pump control, meter control, manifold control)
  - Isolation valves: 20 (pump suction/discharge, meter isolation, manifold isolation)
  - Relief valves: 2-4 (pump discharge protection)

- **Total estimated:** 141-161 valves by system detail vs. 220 valves parametric estimate
  - **Gap:** ~60-80 valves variance
  - **Explanation:** Parametric estimate includes additional utility valves, spares, coordination valves not detailed by system above
  - **Confidence:** LOW (±20-30% variance expected when P&IDs completed)

**Validation Path:** Complete P&IDs for all process systems with valve tagging; develop preliminary valve list with tag numbers and services

**Impact if Incorrect:**
- If actual count 180 valves (-18%): Cost decrease ~$320k-$420k (savings on MAT and CD)
- If actual count 260 valves (+18%): Cost increase ~$360k-$500k (additional MAT and CD)

**Mitigation:** Use parametric midpoint (220 valves) as planning baseline; contingency (24%) provides buffer for ±20% variance

---

### 13.2 Material Selection Assumptions

**A-1603: Stainless steel 316SS assumed for product-contact valves**

**Rationale:**
1. **Food-grade service:** CSD canola oil requires cleanable, non-reactive surfaces (stainless steel preferred)
2. **Coastal marine environment:** Fraser Surrey Terminal corrosion category C4/C5-M (stainless steel reduces corrosion maintenance)
3. **Industry practice:** 316SS typical for edible oil handling and coastal facilities
4. **Deliverable support:** DEL-16.04 Datasheet.md lines 303-314 state "Stainless steel (316SS or 304SS) for food-grade cleanliness and corrosion resistance"

**Material Premium:**
- Stainless steel 316SS valve cost: ~2.5× carbon steel (typical premium $1.5-3.0×)
- Premium impact: +$530k vs. carbon steel baseline

**Alternative Scenarios:**
1. **If carbon steel acceptable (with internal coating):**
   - Cost decrease: ~$530k (-32% MAT cost)
   - Lifecycle consideration: CS with coating requires more maintenance; food-grade coating integrity inspection required
   - Likelihood: LOW (food-grade canola oil handling typically requires SS)

2. **If upgraded alloys required (duplex, super-duplex for severe corrosion):**
   - Cost increase: ~$250k-$400k (+15-25% MAT cost)
   - Likelihood: LOW (316SS adequate for canola oil and coastal environment; duplex unnecessary unless seawater service)

**Validation Path:**
1. Extract material requirements from ER Volume 2 Part 2 (Mechanical specifications)
2. Complete DEL-16.02 valve specification with actual material selections
3. Confirm food-grade cleanliness requirements and corrosion environment classification
4. Obtain vendor quotes for specified materials (validate premium assumption)

**Impact if Incorrect:**
- Material selection drives ~32% of MAT cost
- If downgrade to CS: -$530k (-20% total estimate)
- If upgrade to duplex: +$250k-$400k (+8-12% total estimate)

**Recommendation:** Validate material selection early (immediately); SS 316 conservative assumption appropriate for food-grade + coastal environment

---

### 13.3 Actuation Assumptions

**A-1604: Actuator distribution estimated at 60% manual, 30% pneumatic, 10% electric**

**Breakdown:**
- **Manual valves (132 units, 60%):** Isolation valves for infrequent operation (maintenance isolation, seasonal startup/shutdown)
- **Pneumatic actuated (66 units, 30%):** Control valves (30) + automated isolation ESD/seasonal (36)
- **Electric actuated (22 units, 10%):** Large MOVs for tank isolation, main line isolation (DN200-300)

**Rationale:**
- Typical transload facility: Majority manual isolation; automated for control, safety, and operational efficiency
- Control valves: All automated (pneumatic preferred for modulating control)
- Isolation valves: Automated where ESD required or large size (MOV for torque)

**Cost Impact:**
- Manual valves: ~$4,230/valve avg (valve only)
- Pneumatic actuated: ~$12,000/valve avg (valve + actuator $5k-$15k + accessories $2k-$5k)
- Electric actuated: ~$15,470/valve avg (valve + motor operator $8k-$40k + controls $1k-$3k)
- Actuator equipment: $660k (39% of MAT cost)

**Alternative Scenarios:**
1. **More automation (40% pneumatic, 20% electric):**
   - Cost increase: ~$250k-$350k (+15-21% MAT cost)
   - Driver: Safety requirements (more ESD valves), operational efficiency (remote operation), reduced labor

2. **Less automation (20% pneumatic, 5% electric):**
   - Cost decrease: ~$300k-$400k (-18-24% MAT cost)
   - Driver: Manual operation acceptable; reduced control system complexity; lower capital cost

**Validation Path:**
1. Develop control philosophy document (automation strategy, ESD requirements)
2. Complete P&IDs with valve actuation symbols (hand, pneumatic, electric)
3. Coordinate with PKG-19 (control systems) for ESD valve requirements and fail-safe modes
4. Coordinate with PKG-17 (electrical) and PKG-20 (instrumentation) for actuation power/control availability

**Impact if Incorrect:**
- Actuation level drives ~39% of MAT cost ($660k actuators)
- If more automation (+10% pneumatic, +10% electric): +$250k-$350k (+8-11% total estimate)
- If less automation (-10% pneumatic, -5% electric): -$300k-$400k (-9-12% total estimate)

**Recommendation:** Validate actuation requirements during 30% design; automation level typically increases during design (safety, operational efficiency) → expect trend toward more automation (+$100k-$250k likely)

## 15. Recommended Next Steps

### 15.1 Immediate (Before Decision-Making)

1. **Do NOT use this estimate for:**
   - Procurement (no vendor quotes; specifications TBD)
   - GMP contracting (quantity uncertainty ±30-50% too high)
   - Financing approval (accuracy insufficient; lenders typically require Class 3 or better)
   - Detailed cost planning (contingency too high 24%; unknowns too many)

2. **Suitable for:**
   - Conceptual budgeting (order-of-magnitude cost $3.2M CAD baseline)
   - Feasibility analysis (go/no-go investment decision with range $2.3M-$4.8M)
   - Investment planning (portfolio-level budgeting across 36 packages)
   - Prioritization (relative cost comparison: PKG-16 @ $3.2M vs. other packages)

3. **Present estimate with range:**
   - **Low estimate:** $2,260,000 CAD (-30% Class 5 low bound)
   - **Base estimate:** $3,227,000 CAD (most likely; planning baseline)
   - **High estimate:** $4,841,000 CAD (+50% Class 5 high bound)
   - **Expected realization:** $3,550,000 - $4,200,000 CAD (+10% to +30% vs. base)
     - Rationale: Parametric counts tend to underestimate; vendor quotes often exceed typical rates; actuation level often increases during design

4. **Communicate confidence and limitations:**
   - Confidence: LOW (100% allowance/parametric; no vendor quotes)
   - Maturity: Class 5 / Order of Magnitude (-30% / +50%)
   - Accuracy: Suitable for conceptual budgeting only
   - Validity: January 2026 pricing; subject to escalation over 2-3 year project (+$100k-$252k exposure)

---

### 15.2 Medium-Term (Upgrade to Class 4: -20% / +30%)

**Timeline:** 30-60% design completion (3-6 months typical)

**Required Inputs:**

**1. Complete design deliverables:**
   - P&IDs (PKG-10, PKG-11, PKG-12, PKG-13) with valve tagging, counts, service assignments
   - Piping line list (PKG-14) with line numbers, sizes, pressure classes, valve end connections
   - DEL-16.03 preliminary valve sizing calculations (control valve Cv ranges; relief valve scenarios)
   - DEL-16.04 preliminary valve datasheets (representative valves with sizes, types, materials, actuation)

**2. Obtain vendor budgetary quotes:**
   - **Control valves:** 3-5 vendors (Fisher, Emerson, Valmet) for representative sizes (DN50, DN100, DN150)
   - **Isolation valves:** 3-5 vendors (Velan, Tyco, Crane) for manual and automated valves (representative sizes)
   - **Relief valves:** 2-3 vendors (Crosby, Farris, Leser) for API 526 PRVs (representative orifices D, F, J)
   - **Actuators:** 2-3 vendors (Rotork, Bettis, Limitorque) for pneumatic and electric actuators (representative sizes)
   - **Coverage target:** 30-50% of MAT cost by value (representative valves covering size/type range)

**3. Develop project data:**
   - Engineering manhour budget by deliverable (confirm or revise 3,400 hours)
   - Labor rate tables (pipefitter, instrument tech, electrician all-in rates for BC/Lower Mainland)
   - Construction execution plan (crew makeup, productivity estimate, valve installation duration)
   - Control philosophy (actuation requirements, fail-safe modes, automation level)
   - Hazardous area classification (actuator enclosure requirements for electric actuators)

**4. Re-estimate workflow:**
   - Replace parametric valve count (220 est.) with actual P&ID count
   - Replace allowances ($1,678k MAT) with vendor quotes for 30-50% of valves
   - Replace remaining allowances with rate tables (project labor rates, equipment rates)
   - Recalculate indirects using actual valve count and installation duration
   - Reduce contingency to 15-20% (Class 4 typical; quote-based pricing reduces uncertainty)

**Expected Outcome:**
   - **Accuracy improvement:** -20% / +30% (Class 4)
   - **Confidence improvement:** MEDIUM (30-50% quote coverage; 50-70% rate table coverage)
   - **Contingency reduction:** 15-20% (down from 24%; ~$80k-$125k contingency reduction)
   - **Use cases:** Suitable for budgeting, project approval, preliminary financing discussions

### 15.3 Long-Term (Upgrade to Class 3: -15% / +20%)

**Timeline:** 60-90% design completion (6-12 months typical)

**Required Inputs:**

**1. Complete detailed design:**
   - Finalize DEL-16.02 valve specifications (materials, leakage class, testing requirements, quality standards)
   - Finalize DEL-16.04 valve datasheets (all 220+ valves with full specifications, sizes, trim types, actuation)
   - Complete DEL-16.01 arrangement drawings (valve locations, orientations, access requirements)
   - Complete DEL-16.03 final calculations (all control valve Cv, all relief valve orifices, all actuator sizes)

**2. Obtain firm vendor quotes:**
   - Issue RFQ with final datasheets and specifications (all valve types and sizes)
   - Obtain quotes with pricing validity period (6-12 months to cover procurement lead time)
   - Achieve 60-80% quote coverage by value (firm pricing for majority of valves)
   - Evaluate quotes for technical compliance and commercial competitiveness

**3. Finalize interfaces:**
   - Coordinate with PKG-14 (piping) for final valve sizes, end connections, piping interface details
   - Coordinate with PKG-19 (control systems) and PKG-20 (instrumentation) for final positioner specs, control loops
   - Complete HAZOP (DEL-27.02) and validate relief valve requirements (all overpressure scenarios identified)
   - Obtain hazardous area classification and confirm actuator enclosure ratings (explosion-proof, purged, general purpose)
   - Coordinate with construction team for installation sequence, access, crane requirements

**4. Re-estimate workflow:**
   - Replace all allowances with vendor quotes (60-80% coverage) or project rate tables (20-40% coverage)
   - Use actual valve count from finalized P&IDs (no parametric estimates)
   - Use actual engineering hours from project manhour tracking (vs. estimated 3,400 hours)
   - Calculate indirects using construction schedule (time-based vs. factor-based)
   - Reduce contingency to 10-15% (Class 3 typical; firm quotes and design quantities eliminate most uncertainty)

**Expected Outcome:**
   - **Accuracy improvement:** -15% / +20% (Class 3)
   - **Confidence improvement:** MEDIUM-HIGH (60-80% quote coverage; 20-40% rate table coverage)
   - **Contingency reduction:** 10-15% (down from 24%; ~$230k-$365k contingency reduction)
   - **Use cases:** Suitable for GMP contracting, financing approval, lump-sum bidding, procurement authorization
