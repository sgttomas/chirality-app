| HIGH | 3 |
| MEDIUM | 4 |
| LOW | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **9** |

## R-101: Hazardous Materials Discovery (HIGH)

**Risk Driver:** Scope uncertainty

**Cause:** Hazardous materials survey has not been completed; existing structures (Track 6 ballast, salt tent, Dolphin 2) may contain asbestos, lead paint, or contaminated materials.

**Consequence:** If hazmat discovered during demolition:
- Work stoppage for assessment
- Licensed abatement contractor mobilization
- Significantly higher disposal costs (hazmat disposal vs. standard)
- Schedule delay

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD

**Current Handling:** Placeholder allowance A-110 ($75,000) included for potential hazmat abatement.

**Contingency Contribution:** Included in CD contingency calculation (30% rate).

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Complete hazardous materials survey before mobilization
2. If hazmat identified, obtain abatement quotes and adjust estimate
3. Build hazmat contingency into schedule

## R-102: Dolphin 2 Marine Demolition Scope Uncertainty (HIGH)

**Risk Driver:** Quantity uncertainty

**Cause:** Dolphin 2 structure details unknown (pile count, deck area, pile material, embedment depth). Marine demolition costs are highly variable based on structure complexity and site conditions.

**Consequence:**
- Actual cost could range $250k - $750k vs. $450k allowance
- Marine equipment mobilization costs sensitive to project timing and equipment availability
- Weather delays common for marine work

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD

**Current Handling:** Allowance A-106 ($450,000) sized at mid-range for typical marine pile structure.

**Contingency Contribution:** 30% CD contingency rate applied.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Obtain Dolphin 2 as-built drawings
2. Conduct marine site survey (bathymetry, pile condition assessment)
3. Obtain competitive marine contractor quotes before final estimate

---

## R-103: Track 6 Ballast Contamination (HIGH)

**Risk Driver:** Scope uncertainty

**Cause:** Rail ballast may be contaminated with oil, coal dust, or other materials requiring special handling and disposal.

**Consequence:**
- If contaminated, disposal costs increase significantly ($50-150/ton vs. $10-20/ton for clean material)
- Special handling procedures required
- Potential regulatory reporting requirements

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD (Track 6 line item and waste disposal)

**Current Handling:** A-105 and A-111 sized without contamination premium; risk covered by contingency.

**Contingency Contribution:** 30% CD contingency rate applied.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Complete ballast sampling and testing before estimate finalization
2. If contaminated, revise estimate with contaminated disposal rates
3. Consider ballast treatment options vs. disposal

---

## R-104: Marine Weather/Tide Delays (MEDIUM)

**Risk Driver:** Execution risk

**Cause:** Dolphin 2 demolition subject to weather windows, tide conditions, and marine traffic coordination. Pacific Northwest weather can limit marine work windows.

**Consequence:**
- Extended marine equipment standby costs
- Schedule delay for PKG-01 completion
- Potential knock-on effects to dependent packages

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD, CI

**Current Handling:** CI factor (18%) includes some allowance for supervision during extended duration.

**Contingency Contribution:** Included in overall contingency.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Plan marine work during favorable weather season
2. Include weather contingency in schedule
3. Coordinate early with terminal for marine traffic windows

---

## R-105: Terminal Operations Interference (MEDIUM)

**Risk Driver:** Interface risk

**Cause:** Demolition occurs within active Fraser Surrey Terminal. Work must coordinate with ongoing rail and marine operations.

**Consequence:**
- Work stoppages for terminal operations
- Limited work windows reducing productivity
- Potential additional safety measures required

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD, CI

**Current Handling:** CI factor includes supervision for coordination; specific terminal interface costs not separately estimated.

**Contingency Contribution:** Included in overall contingency.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Early coordination with terminal operations
2. Develop detailed work schedule aligned with terminal windows
3. Include terminal liaison in project team

---

## R-106: No Vendor Quotes — Estimate Accuracy (MEDIUM)

**Risk Driver:** Pricing uncertainty

**Cause:** 100% of estimate is allowance/parametric-based with no vendor quotes or historical data.

**Consequence:**
- Actual costs could vary ±50% from estimate
- Budget may be insufficient or significantly over-allocated
- Decision-making based on low-confidence numbers

**Affected WBS/CBS:** All CBS buckets

**Current Handling:** LOW confidence rating assigned; elevated contingency rates (25% overall).

**Contingency Contribution:** Allowance-heavy adjustment adds +10% to baseline contingency rates.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Obtain vendor quotes for major items before budget approval
2. Treat estimate as order-of-magnitude only until quotes received
3. Re-run estimate with pricing data before construction commitment

---

## R-107: Disposal Facility Capacity/Cost Changes (MEDIUM)

**Risk Driver:** Market risk

**Cause:** Disposal facility tipping fees and availability can change between estimate and execution.

**Consequence:**
- Disposal costs higher than estimated
- May need to haul to more distant facilities
- Recycling rebates may not materialize

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD (disposal line item)

**Current Handling:** A-111 ($95,000) allowance for disposal; no specific facility quotes.

**Contingency Contribution:** 30% CD contingency rate applied.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Obtain current disposal quotes from multiple facilities
2. Confirm recycling facility acceptance and rebate rates
3. Consider locking disposal rates contractually if possible

---

## R-108: Salt Tent Structure Complexity Unknown (LOW)

**Risk Driver:** Scope uncertainty

**Cause:** Salt tent structure type, size, and foundation details unknown.

**Consequence:**
- Cost variance of $50k-$200k possible vs. $125k allowance
- Foundation removal may be more complex than assumed

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / CD

**Current Handling:** A-108 ($125,000) mid-range allowance.

**Contingency Contribution:** 30% CD contingency rate applied.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Obtain salt tent structural drawings or conduct site survey
2. Assess foundation type before finalizing estimate

---

## R-109: Engineering Effort Underestimated (LOW)

**Risk Driver:** Scope uncertainty

**Cause:** Engineering deliverables (drawings, specification, procedures, records) may require more effort than allowances if Employer review cycles are extensive.

**Consequence:**
- Engineering costs exceed budget
- Schedule delay for deliverable completion

**Affected WBS/CBS:** PKG-01 / E, PM

**Current Handling:** Allowances A-101 through A-104 totaling $66,000.

**Contingency Contribution:** 15-20% contingency on E/PM buckets.

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Establish engineering rate table based on project norms
2. Clarify Employer review cycle expectations
