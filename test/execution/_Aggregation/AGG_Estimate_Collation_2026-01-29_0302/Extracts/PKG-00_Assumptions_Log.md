  - Modular office trailers (5 units × $30k rental/year × 2 years) = $300k
  - Welfare facilities (toilets, change rooms, lunch room) = $80k
  - Laydown areas (gravel, fencing, drainage) = $150k
  - Temporary electrical service and distribution = $120k
  - Security fencing (1,000m × $150/m) = $150k
  - Signage, traffic control, misc. = $50k

**Confidence:** LOW (very high uncertainty due to lack of physical quantities)

**Resolution Path:**
1. Obtain Employer's Requirements for site establishment criteria
2. Develop site layout (DEL-00.01) with specific facility counts and areas
