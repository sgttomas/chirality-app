# Risk Register

## PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement Estimate

| ID | Risk Driver | Cause → Consequence | Affected CBS/WBS | Suggested Mitigation | Contingency Handling |
|----|-------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| R-001 | Scope - Quantities | No cut/fill quantities → Earthwork costs highly uncertain | CD, MAT / PKG-02 | Develop design to determine actual volumes; obtain survey | 30% contingency on CD; 25% on MAT |
| R-002 | Scope - Ground Improvement | No geotechnical data → Ground improvement extent unknown | CD, MAT / PKG-02 | Complete geotechnical investigation before finalizing estimate | 30% contingency on ground improvement items |
| R-003 | Price - No Quotes | No vendor quotes → All pricing via allowances | All CBS | Obtain budgetary quotes for major items (drilling, ground improvement) | Elevated contingency on all buckets |
| R-004 | Productivity - Weather | Fraser delta wet climate → Potential earthwork delays | CD, CI / PKG-02 | Schedule earthworks in dry season if possible | 10% productivity factor included in rates |
| R-005 | Productivity - Groundwater | High groundwater table → Dewatering costs could escalate | CD / PKG-02 | Confirm groundwater levels in geotechnical investigation | $50k dewatering allowance; may need increase |
| R-006 | Scope - Contamination | Unknown soil contamination → Disposal cost increases | CD / PKG-02 | Phase 1/2 ESA prior to construction; include in geotech scope | Not included; flag as exclusion risk |
| R-007 | Interface - Existing Utilities | Unknown underground utilities → Relocation costs | CD / PKG-02 | Complete utility locate survey; coordinate with utility owners | Survey allowance included; relocation not included |
| R-008 | Schedule - Access | Construction access constraints → Productivity loss | CD, CI / PKG-02 | Coordinate with Terminal operations per PKG-34 | Assume standard access; constraint risk exists |
| R-009 | Quality - Compaction | Variable soil conditions → Recompaction requirements | CD / PKG-02 | Adequate testing program; qualified contractor | Testing allowance included |
| R-010 | Scope - Surcharge | Settlement may require surcharge preloading → Extended schedule | CD, CI / PKG-02 | Evaluate in geotechnical design; may need schedule float | Not included in base; flag if required |

## Contingency Method

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance adjustment per fallback typical model

**Basis:**
- All line items are allowances (100% allowance-based estimate)
- Per fallback model: +10% above baseline contingency for buckets with ≥80% allowance share
- Applied across all CBS buckets due to LOW confidence level
