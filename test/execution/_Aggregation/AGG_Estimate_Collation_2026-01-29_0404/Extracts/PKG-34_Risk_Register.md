## R-001: Interface Agreement Complexity and Count

**Risk Driver:** Scope + Interface

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Interface agreements with FSPL-TI, Metro Vancouver, utilities, rail assumed based on typical practice; actual count and complexity not confirmed
- **Consequence:** More or more complex interface agreements could significantly increase negotiation effort

**Affected Buckets:** Project Management (PM)

**Affected WBS:** DEL-34.02 (Interface Agreements)

**Probability:** MED-HIGH (interface complexity is typical for port terminal projects)

**Impact:** MED ($60k - $130k range on $90k allowance = ±44% swing)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Identify all required third-party interface agreements early
2. Assess Employer vs. Contractor responsibility per interface
3. Engage legal/commercial resources early for complex interfaces
4. Clarify interface documentation requirements

**Contingency Handling:** PM contingency (20%) provides buffer for moderate complexity increase.

---

## R-002: Project Duration Extension

**Risk Driver:** Schedule

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Construction duration assumed at 24-30 months; actual duration could extend due to design complexity, approval delays, or scope changes
- **Consequence:** Time-based coordination costs (A-003, A-004, A-005) would increase proportionally with extended duration

**Affected Buckets:** Project Management (PM)

**Affected WBS:** DEL-34.01 (Coordination Meetings), DEL-34.03 (Marine Coordination), DEL-34.04 (Security Compliance)

**Probability:** MED (schedule extensions are common for design-build projects)

**Impact:** MED (±20% duration variance = $30k - $40k PM cost impact)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Establish realistic construction schedule with appropriate float
2. Monitor schedule progress against milestones
3. Build schedule contingency into coordination staffing plan
4. Consider early mobilization of coordination resources

**Contingency Handling:** PM contingency (20%) provides buffer for moderate schedule extensions.

---

## R-003: Marine Coordination Complexity

**Risk Driver:** Scope + Interface

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Marine coordination scope assumed based on typical practice; VFPA, Transport Canada, Coast Guard requirements not detailed
- **Consequence:** Higher than expected marine coordination requirements could increase effort

**Affected Buckets:** Project Management (PM)

**Affected WBS:** DEL-34.03 (Marine Coordination Records)

**Probability:** MED (port authority coordination is inherently complex)

**Impact:** LOW-MED ($35k - $70k range on $50k allowance = ±40% swing)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Engage VFPA early to understand marine works coordination requirements
2. Clarify Notice to Mariners preparation and distribution protocol
3. Establish vessel scheduling coordination process
4. Build relationships with port operations team

**Contingency Handling:** PM contingency (20%) provides buffer; marine coordination is manageable cost item.

---

## R-004: Lack of Project-Specific Pricing Sources

**Risk Driver:** Price

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** No vendor quotes or rate tables available for coordination and monitoring services at time of estimate
- **Consequence:** All line items rely on fallback allowances with wide uncertainty ranges

**Affected Buckets:** All CBS buckets (E, PM, P, CI)

**Affected WBS:** All PKG-34 deliverables

**Probability:** HIGH (100% of direct line items affected)

**Impact:** HIGH ($230k - $495k range on $350k direct allowance base = ±34% swing)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Obtain budgetary quotes from coordination service providers
2. Obtain trenchless monitoring quotes from survey firms
3. Develop rate tables for coordination labor
4. Re-run estimate with improved pricing sources

**Contingency Handling:** Elevated contingency percentages (20-25% by bucket) applied to account for pricing uncertainty.

---

## R-005: Trenchless Crossing Monitoring Scope

**Risk Driver:** Scope

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Trenchless crossing count (2-4) and monitoring requirements assumed; actual scope depends on PKG-03 Underground Utilities design
- **Consequence:** More crossings or more intensive monitoring could increase costs

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E), Project Management (PM)

**Affected WBS:** DEL-34.05 (Trenchless Crossing Monitoring Reports)

**Probability:** MED (crossing count may vary with final utility routing)

**Impact:** MED ($60k - $140k range on $95k allowance = ±47% swing)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Coordinate with PKG-03 team on trenchless crossing count and locations
2. Clarify third-party monitoring requirements (railway, utility owner, municipality)
3. Obtain budgetary quotes from survey/monitoring providers
4. Define monitoring frequency and reporting requirements

**Contingency Handling:** E contingency (20%) provides buffer for moderate scope increase.

## R-006: Terminal Operations Interface Complexity

**Risk Driver:** Interface + Productivity

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Construction within active terminal environment; interface with FSPL-TI terminal operations requires coordination
- **Consequence:** Higher than expected terminal interface complexity could increase coordination effort

**Affected Buckets:** Project Management (PM)

**Affected WBS:** DEL-34.01 (Coordination Meetings), DEL-34.02 (Interface Agreements)

**Probability:** MED-HIGH (active terminal construction is inherently complex)

**Impact:** MED (coordination effort could increase 20-30% for complex terminal interface)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Establish strong relationship with FSPL-TI terminal operations early
2. Define clear interface protocols and communication channels
3. Plan construction activities to minimize terminal disruption
4. Build coordination buffer into meeting schedule

**Contingency Handling:** PM contingency (20%) provides buffer for interface complexity.

---

## R-007: Security Compliance Scope

**Risk Driver:** Scope

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** CBSA/Transport Canada security requirements assumed based on typical port security zone requirements
- **Consequence:** More stringent security requirements could increase compliance effort

**Affected Buckets:** Project Management (PM)

**Affected WBS:** DEL-34.04 (Security Compliance Records)

**Probability:** LOW-MED (security requirements are typically well-defined for port zones)

**Impact:** LOW ($25k - $55k range on $40k allowance = ±38% swing, relatively small item)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Clarify CBSA/Transport Canada security requirements early
2. Define TWIC/MSIC requirements and lead times
3. Establish access management protocol
4. Plan workforce security screening early

**Contingency Handling:** PM contingency (20%) provides buffer; security compliance is relatively small cost item.

---

## R-008: Escalation Exposure — Labor Rate Increases

**Risk Driver:** Price

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Estimate uses January 2026 pricing; no escalation applied; coordination is primarily labor-based
- **Consequence:** Labor rate escalation over 24-30 month construction period could add 2-4% annually to costs

**Affected Buckets:** All buckets (primarily PM)

**Affected WBS:** All deliverables

**Probability:** HIGH (labor escalation is typical over multi-year periods)

**Impact:** LOW-MED (2-4% annual escalation x 2-2.5 years = 4-10% = $17k - $43k on $432k base)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Update estimate periodically to current pricing
2. Consider enabling escalation in future estimates
3. Monitor labor market conditions
4. Consider fixed-price service contracts where feasible

**Contingency Handling:** Contingency ($88k = 20.4%) provides buffer for moderate escalation, but is not a substitute for formal escalation calculation.

## Contingency Adequacy Assessment

**Total Contingency:** $88,000 CAD (20.4% of base)

**Risk Exposure:**
- **HIGH risks (R-004):** Address pricing uncertainty; cumulative impact could be ±30% on allowances
- **MED risks (R-001, R-002, R-005, R-006):** Address interface complexity, schedule extension, monitoring scope; cumulative impact ~15-25%

**Assessment:**
- Contingency is **ADEQUATE** for normal project risks and moderate scope/pricing adjustments
- Contingency is **INSUFFICIENT** if multiple high-impact risks materialize (e.g., major schedule extension + complex interfaces)
- Estimate maturity is **Draft/Conceptual** — expect refinement as project schedule and interface requirements are defined

**Recommendation:** Update estimate as soon as construction schedule is finalized and interface agreements are scoped to reduce uncertainty and refine contingency allocation.
