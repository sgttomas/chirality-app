## 4. Estimate Methodology

### 4.1 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS) Mapping

Per D-804, deliverables were mapped to CBS buckets based on deliverable type and marine scope:

| CBS Bucket | WBS Scope | Line Items | Amount | % of Base |
|------------|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| E (Engineering) | DEL-08.01 through DEL-08.11 | 11 | $389,000 | 7.1% |
| MAT (Materials) | Piles, steel, abutments, hardware | 6 | $2,280,000 | 41.7% |
| FRT (Freight) | Marine logistics, barge mobilization | 1 | $175,000 | 3.2% |
| CD (Construction Directs) | Installation, erection, coatings, NDT | 7 | $1,830,000 | 33.5% |
| CI (Construction Indirects) | Supervision, safety, QA/QC (parametric) | 1 | $329,400 | 6.0% |
| PM (Project Mgmt) | EPCM allocation (parametric) | 1 | $276,864 | 5.1% |
| P (Procurement) | Vendor coordination (parametric) | 1 | $49,100 | 0.9% |
| COM (Commissioning) | Testing, proving (parametric) | 1 | $133,182 | 2.4% |

### 4.2 Quantity Takeoff (QTO) Approach

No explicit quantities are defined in the deliverable documents (all are at INITIALIZED state with TBDs). Per Protocol Phase 3.2, when explicit quantities do not exist, the agent proceeds with allowance line items priced by the fallback model (Decision D-805).

**Quantity Assumptions (per A-812 through A-825):**
- Marine piles: 40-60 piles, avg 20m length (requires geotechnical design to confirm)
- Trestle: 150m length, 3m width, 150 tonnes structural steel
- Loading platform: 20m × 15m footprint, 80 tonnes structural steel
- Catwalk: 50m length, 25 tonnes structural steel
- Abutments: 2 units, 40 m³ concrete each

These assumptions are placeholders pending design development (DEL-08.01, DEL-08.03, DEL-08.04).

### 4.3 Allowance Sizing Approach

Per Decision D-806, allowances were sized using:
1. **Engineering deliverables:** Comparable to PKG-01/PKG-02 engineering line items, scaled for marine complexity and additional reports (11 deliverables vs typical 4-8)
2. **Materials:** Industry-typical unit rates for marine piling and structural steel with marine-grade corrosion protection
3. **Construction:** Marine construction rates reflecting specialized marine contractor requirements (barge/crane, marine safety, tide/weather constraints)

No project-specific quotes or rate tables were available; all pricing is allowance-based.

### 4.4 Indirects, Management, and Commissioning

Per D-807, indirects and management were calculated using the Fallback Typical Model:

- **Construction Indirects (CI):** 18% of CD = $329,400
  - Justification: Marine work requires enhanced supervision, marine safety oversight, QA/QC for welding/NDT, and marine operations coordination
- **EPCM/PM:** 6% of (CD + CI + MAT + FRT) = $276,864
  - Justification: Marine engineering coordination across multiple disciplines and interfaces
- **Procurement (P):** 2% of (MAT + FRT) = $49,100
  - Justification: Vendor coordination for marine materials and marine logistics
- **Commissioning (COM):** 3% of (CD + CI + MAT) = $133,182
  - Justification: Structural load testing, proof testing, as-built survey, and acceptance testing

## 5. Design Maturity and Confidence

### 5.1 Design Maturity Assessment

All 11 deliverables are at `INITIALIZED` lifecycle state per `_STATUS.md`. Design content consists of anticipated scope and TBD placeholders.

**Design Maturity:** Pre-conceptual (< 5%)

**Key Design Inputs Still TBD:**
- Employer's Requirements clause extraction (ER Vol 2 Parts 1-2 present but not extracted)
- Design vessel characteristics (dimensions, displacement, berthing/mooring loads)
- Marine geotechnical parameters (pile capacity, soil layering, scour depth)
- Environmental design basis (wind, current, wave, water levels, seismic)
- Final pile type, size, and layout
- Trestle and platform geometry and framing details
- Equipment loads from PKG-09 (fenders, bollards) and PKG-11 (loading arm)
- Codes and standards requirements

### 5.2 Confidence Assessment

| Line Item Type | Confidence | Rationale |
|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Engineering (E) deliverables | LOW | No ER extraction; complexity and scope assumptions only |
| Materials (MAT) | LOW | No geotechnical design; pile type/size/quantity unknown; steel tonnage estimated |
| Freight (FRT) | LOW | Marine logistics highly variable by contractor capability and schedule |
| Construction Directs (CD) | LOW | No design drawings; marine installation complexity and productivity assumptions |
| Indirects/PM/P/COM (parametric) | LOW-MED | Factor-based using fallback model; typical for marine work but unverified |

**Overall Estimate Confidence:** LOW

## 6. Contingency

### 6.1 Contingency Method

Per Decision D-807, contingency method = `PCT_BY_BUCKET` (percentage by CBS bucket).

Given the high allowance share (92.2% of base estimate is ALLOWANCE or PARAMETRIC), a 25% contingency is applied to the base estimate.

### 6.2 Contingency Calculation

| CBS Bucket | Base Amount | Baseline % | Allowance Adjustment | Applied % | Contingency |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| E | $389,000 | 10% | +10% (100% allowance) | 20% | $77,800 |
| MAT | $2,280,000 | 15% | +10% (100% allowance) | 25% | $570,000 |
| FRT | $175,000 | 15% | +10% (100% allowance) | 25% | $43,750 |
| CD | $1,830,000 | 20% | +10% (100% allowance) | 30% | $549,000 |
| CI | $329,400 | 20% | 0% (parametric) | 20% | $65,880 |
| PM | $276,864 | 10% | 0% (parametric) | 10% | $27,686 |
| P | $49,100 | 10% | 0% (parametric) | 10% | $4,910 |
| COM | $133,182 | 25% | 0% (parametric) | 25% | $33,296 |
| **Total** | **$5,463,546** | — | — | **25%** | **$1,372,472** |

**Rounded Contingency:** $1,365,750 (25% of $5,463,000 rounded base)

### 6.3 Contingency Rationale

High contingency reflects:
- Pre-conceptual design maturity (< 5%)
- 100% allowance/parametric pricing (no quotes or rate tables)
- Marine construction complexity and uncertainty
- Unknown geotechnical conditions and pile requirements
- Interfaces to PKG-09 and PKG-11 not yet defined
- Environmental design basis TBD
