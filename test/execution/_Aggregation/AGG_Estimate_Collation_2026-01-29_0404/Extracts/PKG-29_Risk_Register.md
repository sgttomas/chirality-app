## Risk Details

### R-001: Hydrotest Water Disposal Permit Risk

**Risk Driver:** Scope/Regulatory

**Cause:** Hydrotest water discharge permit may not be granted; 100% haul-off may be required

**Consequence:** If 100% haul-off required (vs 50% assumed), additional $120,000 disposal cost

**Affected Buckets:** CD (L-013)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Early engagement with Metro Vancouver/VFPA on discharge permit
2. Confirm canola oil residue treatment requirements
3. Pre-qualify haul-off disposal contractors

**Contingency Handling:** +30% contingency on disposal line item; $120k exposure captured in assumptions

---

### R-002: Tank Hydrotest Water Volume Uncertainty

**Risk Driver:** Quantity

**Cause:** Tank dimensions and hydrotest parameters not confirmed; water volume estimated from MT capacity

**Consequence:** Actual water volume may vary +/- 20%; impacts fill/treatment/disposal costs

**Affected Buckets:** CD (L-011, L-012, L-013), MAT (L-010)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Confirm tank geometry from PKG-13 design
2. Confirm hydrotest water supply source and rate
3. Develop detailed hydrotest plan early

**Contingency Handling:** +25% contingency on tank testing line items

---

### R-003: Test Package Count Uncertainty

**Risk Driver:** Quantity

**Cause:** Piping, electrical, and I&C designs not complete; test package counts are estimates

**Consequence:** More test packages = more testing labor, equipment rental, duration

**Affected Buckets:** CD (L-014, L-015, L-016)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Complete discipline package designs (PKG-14, 17, 19, 20)
2. Develop test package matrix early in detailed design
3. Coordinate with discipline leads on test package boundaries

**Contingency Handling:** +30% contingency on testing execution line items

---

### R-004: FAT Vendor Location Risk

**Risk Driver:** Price

**Cause:** FAT vendor locations not confirmed; travel costs may vary significantly

**Consequence:** International FATs (Europe, Asia) would significantly increase travel/per diem costs

**Affected Buckets:** CD (L-017)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Preference for North American vendors in procurement
2. Consider virtual FAT options where appropriate
3. Consolidate FAT trips where vendors are co-located

**Contingency Handling:** +25% contingency on FAT line item; assumed North American vendors

---

### R-005: Equipment Failure During Testing Risk

**Risk Driver:** Scope

**Cause:** Equipment may fail during testing; repair/replacement required

**Consequence:** Delays and additional costs for repair/replacement; potential re-testing

**Affected Buckets:** CD (all testing lines)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Thorough pre-test inspections
2. Vendor support agreements for critical equipment
3. Spare parts availability for critical items

**Contingency Handling:** Included in overall contingency reserve; no specific line item

---

### R-006: Terminal Operational Interface

**Risk Driver:** Productivity

**Cause:** Testing conducted at active marine terminal; coordination with ongoing operations required

**Consequence:** Reduced productivity (10-20%); potential testing windows/restrictions

**Affected Buckets:** CD, CI

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Early coordination with terminal operations
2. Develop testing windows aligned with vessel schedule
3. Plan testing during lower-activity periods where possible

**Contingency Handling:** +20% productivity allowance in CD rates; reflected in CI factor

---

### R-007: Schedule Compression Risk

**Risk Driver:** Schedule

**Cause:** Testing phase may be compressed due to upstream delays; overtime/additional resources required

**Consequence:** Premium time labor costs; potential quality impacts from rushing

**Affected Buckets:** CD, CI

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Float in testing schedule
2. Mobilize additional testing resources if needed
3. Prioritize critical path testing

**Contingency Handling:** +15% contingency on labor-heavy line items

---

### R-008: Escalation Exposure

**Risk Driver:** Schedule/Price

**Cause:** Testing occurs late in project (year 2-3); labor/material costs may increase

**Consequence:** 3-6% annual escalation not captured in current pricing

**Affected Buckets:** All

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Develop project schedule
2. Apply escalation factors when schedule available
3. Include escalation in future estimate updates

**Contingency Handling:** Risk noted but not priced; potential $65k-$195k exposure

---

### R-009: Coordination with Discipline Packages

**Risk Driver:** Interface

**Cause:** Testing depends on completion of multiple discipline packages (PKG-13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 23)

**Consequence:** Delays in discipline packages delay testing; interface issues may require re-work

**Affected Buckets:** CD (all testing lines)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Early coordination with discipline package leads
2. Define clear testing prerequisites and handover criteria
3. Develop integrated testing schedule

**Contingency Handling:** Interface contingency included in overall contingency

---

### R-010: Environmental Permit Conditions

**Risk Driver:** Regulatory

**Cause:** Environmental permits for hydrotest water discharge may impose additional conditions

**Consequence:** Additional treatment requirements; monitoring; reporting; disposal restrictions

**Affected Buckets:** CD (L-012, L-013), MAT (L-010)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Early permit application
2. Engage environmental consultant for permit conditions review
3. Plan for conservative treatment approach

**Contingency Handling:** +25% contingency on treatment and disposal line items
