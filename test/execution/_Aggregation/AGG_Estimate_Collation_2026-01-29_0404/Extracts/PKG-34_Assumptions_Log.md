## Assumption Summary

This log documents all assumptions and allowances used in the PKG-34 estimate where explicit quantities, rates, or pricing were not available from project-specific sources.

**Context:** No vendor quotes, budgetary proposals, or project rate tables were available for coordination and interface management services (see Source_Index.md). All cost estimates use fallback allowances based on typical EPC design-build project experience.

  - Coordination effort: $4,000-$5,000 per month
  - Includes: VFPA coordination, Notices to Mariners, Transport Canada liaison, Coast Guard coordination
  - Includes: Vessel scheduling coordination, marine contractor interface

**Confidence:** LOW

**Resolution Path:**
1. Clarify marine works duration from project schedule
2. Define VFPA/Transport Canada/Coast Guard coordination requirements
3. Establish Notice to Mariners preparation and distribution protocol

## A-005: Security Compliance Records — DEL-34.04

**Assumption:** CBSA/Transport Canada security compliance documentation estimated at $40,000 CAD allowance.

**Why Needed:** No cost data for security compliance effort. Security requirements for port security zone not detailed.
