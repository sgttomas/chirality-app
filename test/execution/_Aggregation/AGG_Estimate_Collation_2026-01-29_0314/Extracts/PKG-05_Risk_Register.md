## R-001: No Vendor Pricing Available

**Risk ID:** R-001
**Risk Driver:** Price uncertainty
**Category:** Pricing basis

**Cause:** No vendor quotes or budgetary proposals obtained for concrete supply, rebar fabrication, formwork systems, or testing services.

**Consequence:** All material and installation costs are allowances based on typical EPC experience rather than market-validated pricing. Actual bids could be significantly higher or lower.

**Affected CBS:** MAT, CD (86.9% of base)
**Affected WBS:** All physical work scope

**Cost Impact (qualitative):** HIGH — Could swing estimate ±25-40%

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Obtain budgetary quotes from concrete suppliers in BC Lower Mainland
2. Obtain quotes from rebar fabricators
3. Obtain formwork rental quotes for containment wall construction
4. Re-run estimate with actual pricing

**Contingency Handling:** Elevated contingency rates (20-25%) applied to MAT and CD buckets to partially cover pricing uncertainty.

## R-002: Quantity Uncertainty — Concrete and Rebar

**Risk ID:** R-002
**Risk Driver:** Quantity uncertainty
**Category:** Scope definition

**Cause:** No dimensioned drawings or detailed quantity takeoffs available. Concrete volumes (1,330 m³) and rebar quantities (180,000 kg) are parametrically derived from tank parameters.

**Consequence:** Actual quantities could be significantly different once designs are developed. Reinforcement ratios particularly uncertain (assumed 100-150 kg/m³).

**Affected CBS:** MAT, CD
**Affected WBS:** Tank foundations, containment walls, equipment pads, thrust blocks, reinforcing steel

**Cost Impact (quantitative):**
- Concrete volume uncertainty: ±30% = ±$200k
- Rebar quantity uncertainty: ±35% = ±$190k
- Combined uncertainty: ±$390k (19% of base)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Develop preliminary structural layouts to 30% level
2. Prepare quantity takeoffs from DEL-05.01 drawings
3. Validate reinforcement ratios against similar projects

**Contingency Handling:** Allowance-heavy adjustment (+5%) applied to contingency rates.

## R-003: Foundation Type Uncertainty

**Risk ID:** R-003
**Risk Driver:** Design uncertainty
**Category:** Technical risk

**Cause:** Tank foundation type (ring wall vs. mat foundation) not yet determined. Estimate assumes ring wall foundations per Decision D-011.

**Consequence:** If geotechnical conditions require mat foundations (e.g., soft soils, liquefaction concerns), foundation costs could increase 50-100%.

**Affected CBS:** MAT, CD
**Affected WBS:** Tank foundations (A-005)

**Cost Impact (quantitative):**
- Current ring wall estimate: $180,000
- Mat foundation (if required): $270,000 - $360,000
- Potential additional cost: $90,000 - $180,000

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Complete geotechnical investigation (PKG-02 coordination)
2. Confirm foundation type early in design development
3. If mat foundations required, update estimate

**Contingency Handling:** Risk partially covered by 25% contingency on CD.

---

## R-004: Geotechnical Conditions Unknown

**Risk ID:** R-004
**Risk Driver:** Ground conditions
**Category:** Site conditions

**Cause:** Geotechnical parameters (bearing capacity, settlement characteristics, groundwater levels) not yet available from PKG-02.

**Consequence:** Foundation designs may require additional depth, piling, ground improvement, or dewatering not included in estimate.

**Affected CBS:** CD, CI
**Affected WBS:** All foundation work

**Cost Impact (qualitative):** MED-HIGH
- If piles required: +$500k - $1.5M (not included in PKG-05 scope)
- If ground improvement required: Covered in PKG-02 estimate
- If dewatering required: +$50k - $150k

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Coordinate with PKG-02 for geotechnical parameters
2. Review geotechnical report once available (DEL-02.04)
3. Update foundation approach if conditions warrant

**Contingency Handling:** Foundation contingency set at 25%; deep foundations (piles) excluded from scope.

## Contingency Adequacy Assessment

**Contingency Applied:** $451,000 CAD (21.5% of base)

**Coverage Assessment:**
- **Adequate for:** Normal project risks, moderate quantity adjustments, typical pricing variance
- **Partially adequate for:** Foundation type change (R-003), geotechnical unknowns (R-004)
- **NOT adequate for:** Major scope growth from ER requirements, significant escalation, deep foundation requirement

**Overall Assessment:** Contingency is **marginally adequate** for current estimate maturity. If multiple high-impact risks materialize (R-001 + R-002 + R-003 + R-004), contingency may be insufficient.

**Recommendation:** Re-evaluate contingency when vendor quotes and detailed designs are available. Consider explicit escalation provision for long-duration construction.
