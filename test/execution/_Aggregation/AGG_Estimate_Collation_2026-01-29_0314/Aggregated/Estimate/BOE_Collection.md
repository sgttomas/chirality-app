## Latest Package: PKG-25 Communications & IT

### Overview
**Total Estimate:** $723,000 CAD (includes contingency)
**Base Estimate:** $563,000 CAD (rounded; actual $594k)
**Contingency:** $160,000 CAD (28% blended rate)
**Confidence:** LOW (82% allowance/parametric; no vendor quotes)

### Scope
PKG-25 covers communications network infrastructure, fiber and copper cabling, network switches, and telecommunications rooms.

**Deliverables (4):**
- DEL-25.01: Communications Design Drawing Set
- DEL-25.02: Communications Technical Specification
- DEL-25.03: Communications Data Sheet Package
- DEL-25.04: Communications Installation & Test Records

### Key Components
- **Fiber Optic System:** 800-1500 LM (OS2 single-mode backbone + OM3/OM4 multi-mode distribution)
- **Structured Copper Cabling:** 1500-2500 LM Cat 6/6A; 50-100 outlets
- **Network Equipment:** 4-8 switches; 150-300 total ports; managed VLAN/QoS
- **Patch Panels:** 8-15 fiber and copper panels; 19" rack-mount
- **Infrastructure:** Cable management, labeling, grounding

### Cost Breakdown
- Materials & Equipment (MAT): $275,000 (46% of base)
- Construction Directs (CD): $160,000 (27% of base)
- Engineering & Design (E): $75,000 (13% of base)
- Construction Indirects (CI): $28,800 (5%)
- EPCM/PM: $32,028 (5%)
- Commissioning (COM): $16,014 (3%)
- Procurement (P): $6,900 (1%)

### Pricing Basis
- **Equipment/Materials:** 100% allowances (typical industrial network pricing)
- **Labor:** Allowances based on Vancouver/Lower Mainland BC rates
- **Indirects/Services:** Factor-based (CI=18%, P=2%, PM=6%, COM=3%)

### Key Assumptions
1. Fiber optic system: 800-1500 LM; routing TBD ($120k, 20% of base)
2. Copper cabling: 1500-2500 LM; building layouts TBD ($85k, 14% of base)
3. Network switches: 4-8 units; architecture undefined ($95k, 16% of base)
4. Engineering design: 600-800 hours @ $125-150/hr ($75k, 13% of base)
5. TR locations: 1 ER + 2-4 TRs; coordinate with PKG-21/PKG-22

### Key Risks
1. Network architecture undefined (±30-50% equipment cost)
2. No vendor quotes (±20-40% pricing variance)
3. Technology selections TBD (Cat 6 vs 6A, PoE requirements)
4. Building layouts unavailable (±25-40% cable quantities)
5. Terminal access constraints (10-20% productivity reduction)
6. Escalation exposure (3-6% annually; $34k-$100k potential)

### Exclusions
- CCTV network (PKG-24 per DEC-05)
- Access control network (PKG-24 per DEC-05)
- Control system networks (PKG-19 - integration points only)
- Cable pathways/trays (PKG-17/PKG-21)
