|-----|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| E | $178,000 | $15,000-$40,000 | $36,000 | Adequate |
| PM | $67,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | $13,000 | Adequate |
| P | $14,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000 | Adequate |
| MAT | $892,000 | $100,000-$350,000 | $223,000 | Partial |
| CD | $345,000 | $50,000-$150,000 | $104,000 | Partial |
| CI | $62,000 | $10,000-$30,000 | $19,000 | Adequate |
| COM | $33,000 | $5,000-$15,000 | $12,000 | Adequate |
| **Total** | **$1,591,000** | **$187,000-$600,000** | **$410,000** | **Partial** |

**Assessment:** Contingency of $410,000 (25.7%) provides adequate coverage for expected risks but may be insufficient if multiple high-impact risks materialize. Key risk mitigation is obtaining building size confirmation and vendor quotes.
