## R-801: Geotechnical Conditions Worse Than Assumed

**Risk Driver:** Scope / Quantity / Productivity

**Cause:**
- Marine geotechnical investigation (DEL-08.04) not yet performed
- Soil parameters, pile bearing capacity, and scour depth unknown
- Pile type, size, quantity, and embedment depth are assumptions

**Consequence:**
- Pile quantity may increase (more piles required for capacity)
- Pile length may increase (deeper embedment required)
- Pile installation costs may increase (difficult driving, refusal, pre-drilling)
- Potential for pile design changes (H-pile vs pipe pile, larger sections)

**Affected Buckets:**
- MAT (Materials): A-812 Marine Piling Supply
- CD (Construction Directs): A-819 Marine Piling Installation
- E (Engineering): A-803, A-804 (additional geotechnical work, re-design)

**Potential Cost Impact:** +$200k to +$500k (15% to 40% increase in piling scope)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Prioritize marine geotechnical investigation (DEL-08.04) immediately
2. Obtain multiple geotechnical consultant quotes to confirm investigation scope
3. Review existing geotechnical data for Fraser River site if available
4. Include pile load testing in investigation scope to verify capacity assumptions

**Contingency Handling:** Partially covered by 25-30% contingency on MAT/CD piling line items
