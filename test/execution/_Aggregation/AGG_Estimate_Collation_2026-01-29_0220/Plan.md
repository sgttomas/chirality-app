# Plan

## What Was Done
1. Read PKG-15 estimate artifacts from `EST_PKG15_DRAFT_2026-01-28_2345`.
2. Copied prior pipeline extracts (PKG-00 through PKG-14) and added PKG-15 extracts to the new snapshot audit trail.
3. Validated `Detail.csv` schema presence for all packages and collated line items into `Project_Detail.csv`.
4. Aggregated assumptions and risks into project-level CSVs; collated BOEs into `BOE_Collection.md`.
5. Built cumulative CBS and WBS summaries and coverage table.
6. Generated QA and run summary; updated pointers.
