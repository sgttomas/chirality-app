## Contingency Adequacy Assessment

**Total Base Estimate:** $2,408,000 (rounded)
**Total Contingency:** $643,000 (27% blended rate)
**Total Estimate:** $3,051,000

**Risk Impact Range:** $896k (low) to $1,662k (high)
- **Low case (optimistic):** If no major risks materialize, contingency of $643k exceeds low-case risk impact of $896k → **adequate**
- **High case (pessimistic):** If multiple risks materialize, contingency of $643k is insufficient vs high-case risk impact of $1,662k → **insufficient**

**Contingency Coverage Ratio:**
- Low case: $643k / $896k = 72% → **marginal coverage**
- High case: $643k / $1,662k = 39% → **insufficient coverage**

**Recommendation:**
- Current contingency (27%) is appropriate for **Class 4-5 Preliminary / Conceptual** estimate given high allowance share (65%)
- To improve contingency adequacy:
  1. **Immediate:** Complete coating specifications (DEL-26.01) to reduce scope risk (R-2601)
  2. **Short-term:** Obtain vendor budgetary quotes to replace allowances and reduce pricing risk (R-2601, R-2602, R-2603)
  3. **Medium-term:** Define shop/field coating responsibilities and quantify field painting scope (R-2604)
  4. **Ongoing:** Monitor regulatory requirements (VOC compliance, food-grade certification) and adjust estimate if confirmed (R-2602, R-2607)
- As estimate matures to **Class 3 Budget** (with vendor quotes and completed specifications), contingency rate should reduce to **15-20%**
- As estimate matures to **Class 2 Definitive** (with firm quotes and detailed design), contingency rate should reduce to **8-12%**
