## PKG-33: HSE Management

**Estimate:** $964,000 CAD (base: $775,000 + contingency: $189,000)
**Snapshot:** EST_PKG33_DRAFT_2026-01-29_1100

### Scope Summary
- Occupational Health & Safety Plan
- Risk assessments and job hazard analyses (30-50 activities)
- Safe work method statements (25-40 high-risk activities)
- CEMP compliance monitoring (24-month construction)
- SPPP compliance monitoring and BMP inspections
- Waste management tracking and manifesting
- Emergency Response Plan preparation
- Waterway pollution control method statement

### Pricing Methodology
- **E:** 100% allowance ($545k) for HSE plans, assessments, procedures
- **CI:** 69% allowance, 31% parametric ($306k) for construction monitoring
- **COM:** 100% allowance ($67k) for commissioning monitoring
- **PM, P:** Parametric factors (6%, 2% of base)

### Key Assumptions
1. OHS Plan: $120k (±33% range)
2. CEMP compliance: $140k (largest cost driver, 18%)
3. Construction duration: 24 months
4. Risk assessments: 30-50 activities
5. Method statements: 25-40 high-risk activities

### Confidence & Maturity
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Maturity:** Class 5 (Order of Magnitude)
- **Status:** DRAFT (96% allowance-based)
- **Primary Gap:** Regulatory requirements not confirmed, no vendor quotes

### Primary Risks
1. HSE regulatory requirements uncertainty (R-001): MEDIUM probability, MED-HIGH impact
2. Environmental monitoring scope creep (R-002): MED-HIGH probability, MEDIUM impact
3. Labor market escalation (R-007): HIGH probability, MEDIUM impact ($25k-$60k exposure)

### Recommended Actions
1. Engage VFPA, WorkSafeBC for compliance requirements
2. Obtain HSE/environmental consultant quotes
3. Define CEMP/SPPP monitoring scope
4. Add escalation provision separate from contingency
