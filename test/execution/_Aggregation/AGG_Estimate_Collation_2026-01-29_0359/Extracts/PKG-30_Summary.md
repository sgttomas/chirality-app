## Estimate Basis and Confidence

**Estimate Class:** Class 5 (Conceptual / Order of Magnitude)
- Accuracy range: -30% to +50% (typical for Class 5)
- Maturity: Based on decomposition and deliverable datasheets
- Detailed commissioning procedures and schedules not yet developed

**Pricing Method Distribution:**
- Vendor quotes: 0%
- Rate tables: 15% ($703k - commissioning labor rates)
- Allowances: 72% ($3,357k)
- Parametric factors: 13% ($619k - indirects/services)

**Confidence Level:** LOW to MEDIUM
- 72% of base cost is allowance/parametric (limited detailed scope)
- Commissioning labor rates based on typical BC market rates (MEDIUM confidence)
- Duration assumptions based on facility scale (LOW-MEDIUM confidence)
- Vendor support scope based on typical requirements (LOW confidence)
- Terminal continuity constraints introduce schedule uncertainty

**Source:** BOE.md §3, §8; QA_Report.md

## Key Assumptions

**Duration Assumptions (A-008, A-010, A-015):**
- Total commissioning duration: 30 weeks (~7.5 months)
- Phased approach: Pre-commissioning (8 weeks), system commissioning (12 weeks), IST (6 weeks), start-up/performance (4 weeks)
- Terminal continuity constraints extend duration by ~20% vs unrestricted schedule
- Average commissioning team size: 10 FTE (variable 6-14 FTE)

**Scope Assumptions (A-003, A-005, A-018):**
- ~30 commissioning procedures required (pre-commissioning, commissioning, start-up)
- Vendor support required for tanks, metering (proving), marine loading, control systems
- Metering system proving is critical (custody transfer accuracy - OBJ-10) and time-intensive (3 weeks)

**Pricing Assumptions (A-020, A-022):**
- Commissioning labor rates: $85-135/hr fully burdened (includes travel, per diem, markup)
- Test equipment rental: 6-month rental period
- Tank hydrotest water: ~45,000 m³ requiring treatment and discharge

## Key Risks

**R-001: Terminal Continuity Constraints**
- Existing terminal operations limit commissioning work windows
- Mitigation: Early coordination; flexible scheduling; 15% schedule float

**R-003: Metering System Proving Delays**
- Custody transfer meter proving can encounter technical issues
- Mitigation: Pre-qualify proving contractor; 25% contingency on metering costs

**R-005: Marine Loading Commissioning Weather**
- Requires suitable weather and tide conditions
- Mitigation: Plan for summer weather window; 20% schedule contingency

**R-008: Vendor Support Availability**
- Specialized vendor support may not be available on schedule
- Mitigation: Lock in vendor support early in equipment purchase terms

**R-010: Defect Rectification Scope**
- Construction defects discovered during commissioning
- Mitigation: Strong construction QA/QC; $75k allowance with 30% contingency

## Known Gaps and Limitations

**Primary Gaps:**
1. Detailed commissioning procedures not available (affects engineering scope)
2. System handover schedule unknown (affects commissioning duration)
3. Vendor commissioning requirements not defined (affects vendor support scope)
4. Regulatory witness point requirements unknown (affects schedule)
5. Performance test acceptance criteria not defined (affects testing scope)

**Resolution Path:**
- Develop DEL-30.01 (Commissioning Procedures) and DEL-30.02 (Commissioning Plan)
- Coordinate with construction schedule for system handover dates
- Confirm vendor requirements with equipment packages (PKG-10 through PKG-24)
- Coordinate with PKG-32 for regulatory inspection requirements
- Define performance test criteria in DEL-30.06

**Source:** BOE.md §8.2; QA_Report.md

---

## Exclusions

- Owner's costs, land, financing, Employer-obtained permits
- Other packages (PKG-00 through PKG-29, PKG-31 through PKG-35)
- Operations personnel training (covered in PKG-35)
- Product supply for commissioning (first product assumed Employer-provided)
- Escalation (January 2026 pricing basis)
- Taxes (GST/PST)

**Source:** BOE.md §2.2

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Refine Scope:**
   - Develop commissioning procedures (DEL-30.01) to define detailed commissioning activities
   - Develop commissioning plan and schedule (DEL-30.02) with integrated construction schedule

2. **Validate Assumptions:**
   - Confirm commissioning team size and duration with construction schedule
   - Validate vendor commissioning requirements with equipment procurement packages
   - Confirm terminal operations constraints with Employer

3. **Obtain Vendor Input:**
   - Request budgetary quotes for specialized commissioning support (metering proving, tank instrumentation, marine loading)
   - Request commissioning duration estimates from major equipment vendors

4. **Update Estimate:**
   - Re-estimate to Class 4 or Class 3 as scope and schedule mature
   - Replace allowances with vendor quotes where available
   - Refine duration estimates based on integrated construction/commissioning schedule
