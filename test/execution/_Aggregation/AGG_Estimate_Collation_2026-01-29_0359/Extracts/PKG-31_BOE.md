## 6. Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)

### 6.1 CBS Categories Used

| CBS Code | Category | Definition |
|----------|----------|------------|
| E | Engineering & Design | CAD drafting, technical writing, design documentation |
| PM | Project Management | Document control, coordination, QA, compilation, registers |
| MAT | Materials | Printing, binding, document management software |
| CONT | Contingency | Risk-based reserve by CBS bucket |

### 6.2 CBS Distribution

| CBS | Base Amount | % of Base | Contingency % | Contingency | Total | % of Total |
|-----|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| E | $472,000 | 62.5% | 10% | $47,000 | $519,000 | 61.9% |
| PM | $224,000 | 29.7% | 10% | $22,000 | $246,000 | 29.3% |

## 7. Indirects Model

### 7.1 Application Method

Documentation work is primarily engineering office-based and PM coordination. Standard office overhead is included in labor rates.

**No additional field indirects applied** (this package does not involve construction field activities).

**No construction equipment applied** (office/IT equipment included in labor rates).

---

## 8. Contingency Methodology

### 8.1 Method

**PCT_BY_BUCKET** method applied per config.

Contingency percentages by CBS bucket:

| CBS Bucket | Baseline % | Allowance Share | Allowance Adjustment | Total % Applied |
|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Engineering (E) | 10% | 0% | +0% | 10% |
| Project Management (PM) | 10% | 0% | +0% | 10% |
| Materials (MAT) | 15% | 100% | +10% | 25% |

**Allowance Adjustment Rule:**
- If bucket allowance share ≥ 50%: +5%
- If bucket allowance share ≥ 80%: additional +5% (total +10%)

### 8.2 Rationale

**Engineering (E) - 10% contingency:**
- Baseline rate for parametric engineering estimates
- Primary risks: Drawing count variance, VFPA standards interpretation, as-built markup complexity
- No allowances in this bucket (all parametric)

**Project Management (PM) - 10% contingency:**
- Baseline rate for parametric PM estimates
- Primary risks: Vendor documentation quality/completeness, Employer requirements clarification, coordination complexity
- No allowances in this bucket (all parametric)

**Materials (MAT) - 25% contingency:**
- Higher rate due to 100% allowance-based pricing
- Primary risks: Printing/binding cost variance, document management software cost variance
- No quotes available at this stage

**Overall contingency: 11%** (blended across buckets)

---

## 9. Escalation

**Escalation Mode:** NONE (per config)

**Pricing Date:** January 2026

**Assumption:** All costs in "dollars of" January 2026. No escalation to future expenditure dates applied.

**Rationale:** Escalation typically handled at project-level aggregation or reserved as separate line item by Employer.

## 10. Completeness Metrics

### 10.1 Pricing Source Maturity

| Metric | Value | Target (Class 3) | Gap |
|--------|-------|------------------|-----|
| % priced by QUOTE | 0% | 40-60% | -40% to -60% |
| % priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% | 30-50% | -30% to -50% |
| % priced by PARAMETRIC/ALLOWANCE | 100% | 10-20% | +80% to +90% |

**Assessment:** Estimate maturity is Class 5 (Order of Magnitude). Significant gaps exist. See Section 11 for improvement path.

### 10.2 Quantity Takeoff Maturity

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Drawing count verification | 0% | Parametric estimate only; not verified from design |
| Equipment count verification | 0% | Parametric estimate only; not verified from engineering deliverables |
| System breakdown verification | 0% | Parametric estimate only; not verified from design |

## 11. Known Gaps & Improvement Path

### 11.1 Critical Gaps

1. **Drawing count not verified:** Estimate uses 275 sheets (±30% range). Actual count depends on design maturity.
   - **Resolution:** Confirm drawing count at 30% design milestone (PKG-27 deliverables).

2. **Equipment and system counts not verified:** Estimates use 90 equipment items and 12 systems.
   - **Resolution:** Cross-check against equipment lists from engineering (PKG-27) and commissioning scope (PKG-30).

3. **VFPA drawing standards not reviewed:** Production rates assume typical standards.
   - **Resolution:** Obtain VFPA drawing standards and templates; adjust effort if more stringent than assumed.

4. **Employer's asset hierarchy requirements not detailed:** Allowance included but format/detail unknown.
   - **Resolution:** Clarify CMMS integration requirements and database format with Employer.

5. **No quotes for printing/binding:** Allowances used.
   - **Resolution:** Obtain quotes from BC Lower Mainland large-format printing vendors.

### 11.2 Recommended Next Steps

**To improve estimate to Class 4 (-25%/+40%):**
1. Confirm drawing count from 30% design deliverables (PKG-27)
2. Confirm equipment list from engineering
3. Obtain VFPA drawing standards
4. Obtain budgetary quotes for printing/binding services
5. Clarify Employer's deliverable copy quantities and formats

**To improve estimate to Class 3 (-15%/+25%):**
1. All Class 4 items complete
2. Finalize equipment and system breakdown from 60-90% design
3. Confirm vendor documentation scope with major equipment vendors
4. Lock in printing/binding quotes
5. Finalize asset hierarchy database requirements and obtain software/services quote
