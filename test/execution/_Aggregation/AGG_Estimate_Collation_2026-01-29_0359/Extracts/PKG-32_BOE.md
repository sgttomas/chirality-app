## 5. Estimate Methodology

### 5.1 WBS to CBS Mapping

**Mapping Logic:**
- **Document deliverables** (DEL-32.01 Permit Applications, DEL-32.07-32.08 Correspondence) → **Engineering (E)** and **Project Management (PM)**
- **Permit deliverable** (DEL-32.02 Permits) → **Project Management (PM)** and **Materials (MAT)** (fees)
- **QA/QC record deliverables** (DEL-32.03-32.06 Compliance Records) → **Construction Indirects (CI)**
- **Consultant support** → **Engineering (E)**
- **Indirects and overhead** → **Procurement (P)**, **Project Management (PM)**, **Commissioning (COM)** (parametric allocations)

**Rationale:** Deliverable types (Document, Permit, Record, Document Package) and descriptions indicate administrative/document work rather than physical construction; no materials, equipment, or field installation work identified

**Decision:** D-3210

**Source:** WBS_CBS_Matrix.csv; Decomposition Section 5 PKG-32 deliverable types

---

### 5.2 Quantity Extraction

**Extracted (Qualitative):**
- 8 deliverables (document/record types)
- Regulatory authorities identified: VFPA, DFO, Transport Canada, City of Surrey, WorkSafeBC, fire authority
- Permit types identified: VFPA PER, DFO Fisheries Act, Transport Canada approvals, building permit, construction permits, environmental permits, fire protection approval
- Compliance categories: VFPA PER compliance, DFO compliance, Transport Canada compliance, code compliance
- Correspondence types: applications, RFIs, submittals, approvals, inspection requests, meeting minutes
- Standards/regulations referenced: Fisheries Act, Transport Canada rail/marine regulations, building codes, fire codes, electrical codes, environmental regulations

**Not Extracted (TBD — Missing from Sources):**
- Number of distinct permits required (count TBD — depends on Employer's Requirements permit list)
- Number of permit conditions per permit (TBD — depends on issued permits)
- Engineering hours required per deliverable or permit type (TBD — no resource plan)
- PM/QA hours required per deliverable or permit type (TBD — no resource plan)
- Number of authority meetings/inspections (TBD — project schedule dependent)
- Permit fee amounts (TBD — authority fee schedules not available)
- Consultant scope and hours (TBD — procurement not complete)
- Correspondence volume (TBD — project complexity dependent)

**Impact:** Cannot create unit-rate-based quantity takeoff (QTO); forced to use LS (lump sum) allowances based on typical regulatory/permitting package complexity for similar industrial/marine projects

**Source:** Deliverable Datasheet.md and Specification.md files (all 8 deliverables); Decomposition Section 5 PKG-32; QA_Report.md Section 4.1

---

### 5.3 Indirects, Management, and Overhead Allocation

**Method:** Parametric factors per fallback typical model (no project-specific indirects model or time-phased resource plan available)

**Factors Applied:**
- **Procurement (P):** 2% × MAT ($85k including consultant costs) = $1.7k
- **Project Management (PM):** 6% × (E + MAT + CD + CI) = 6% × $250k = $15k total (includes $8k explicit + $7k parametric)
- **Commissioning (COM):** 3% × (E + MAT + CD + CI) = 3% × $250k = $7k

**Rationale:**
- **P factor (2%):** Typical procurement services allocation for consultant engagement and fee payment processing; range 1%-3%
- **PM factor (6%):** Typical EPCM/PM allocation for project coordination and management; range 4%-10%
- **COM factor (3%):** Typical commissioning/closeout allocation for regulatory closeout; range 1%-5%

**Confidence:** MED (typical industry factors; not project-specific)

**Source:** D-3209; AGENT_ESTIMATING fallback model lines 662-673

**Alternative Method (Future):** Develop time-phased resource plan with PM/procurement/commissioning hours by deliverable and phase; apply project-specific labor rates

---

## 6. Risk, Contingency, and Escalation

### 6.1 Risk Register Summary

**Total Risks Identified:** 8 (R-3201 through R-3208)

**High-Impact Risks:**
- R-3201: Permit count and scope uncertainty (permit list unknown) — affects E, MAT, CI buckets
- R-3202: Permit condition complexity unknown (issued permits not available) — affects CI bucket
- R-3203: Authority approval timeline risk (permit delays) — affects PM, E buckets
- R-3208: Employer's Requirements interpretation risk (ER not reviewed) — affects all buckets

**See:** Risk_Register.md for detailed risk descriptions, mitigation strategies, and contingency allocation rationale

---

### 6.2 Contingency Methodology

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by CBS bucket with allowance-heavy adjustment)
**Decision:** D-3206
**Source:** `_CONFIG.md` contingency_method; AGENT_ESTIMATING fallback model lines 676-691

**Baseline Contingency Rates (Before Adjustment):**
- Engineering (E): 10%
- Project Management (PM): 10%
- Procurement (P): 10%
- Materials (MAT): 15%
- Construction Directs (CD): 20% (N/A — zero base)
- Construction Indirects (CI): 20%
- Commissioning (COM): 25%

**Allowance-Heavy Adjustment:**
- **Rule:** If bucket AllowanceShare ≥ 0.50 → add +0.05; if ≥ 0.80 → add +0.10 total
- **E bucket:** 100% allowance ($135k/$135k) → baseline 10% + **10% adjustment** = **20%**
- **MAT bucket:** 100% allowance ($25k/$25k) → baseline 15% + **10% adjustment** = **25%**
- **CI bucket:** 100% allowance ($90k/$90k) → baseline 20% + **10% adjustment** = **30%**
- **PM bucket:** 53% allowance ($8k/$15k) → baseline 10% + **5% adjustment** = **15%**
- **P bucket:** parametric (0% allowance) → baseline 10% + **no adjustment** = **10%**
- **COM bucket:** parametric (0% allowance) → baseline 25% + **no adjustment** = **25%**

**Contingency Allocation:**

| CBS | Base | Allowance Share | Adjusted Rate | Contingency |
|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| E | $135,000 | 100% | 20% | $27,000 |
| PM | $15,000 | 53% | 15% | $2,250 |
| P | $1,700 | 0% | 10% | $170 |
| MAT | $25,000 | 100% | 25% | $6,250 |
| CD | $0 | N/A | N/A | $0 |
| CI | $90,000 | 100% | 30% | $27,000 |
| COM | $7,000 | 0% | 25% | $1,750 |
| **Total** | **$273,700** | **85%** | **23%** | **$64,420** |

**Rounded Contingency:** $64,000 (rounded per rounding policy)

**Blended Contingency Rate:** 23% ($64k / $274k base)

**Rationale:** High allowance percentage (85%) and high scope uncertainty (permit list TBD, ER not reviewed, no resource plan) justify higher contingency rates to cover:
- Permit count variance (±30% on permit-related buckets)
- Permit condition complexity variance (±40% on compliance monitoring)
- Approval timeline variance (±20% on PM/engineering)
- Rate variance (±10-20% on labor/consultant rates)
- ER interpretation variance (±20-30% on overall package scope)

**See:** Risk_Register.md for risk-to-contingency mapping

---

### 6.3 Escalation

**Mode:** NONE (no escalation applied)
**Decision:** D-3207
**Source:** `_CONFIG.md` escalation_mode = NONE

**Rationale:** Pricing date = January 2026 (current); estimate represents "current dollars" pricing basis; no escalation to future expenditure dates applied

**If Escalation Required (Future):** Update `_CONFIG.md` escalation_mode to EXPLICIT; provide escalation factors and cashflow/expenditure schedule; re-run estimate

---

## 7. Rounding and Precision

**Rounding Policy:** Nearest $1,000 CAD
**Source:** `_CONFIG.md` rounding = 1000

**Applied To:**
- Base estimate: $273,700 → $274,000
- Contingency: $64,420 → $64,000
- Total estimate: $337,700 → $338,000

**Precision Discipline:** Do not report more significant digits than maturity supports (Class 5 estimate; ±30% to +50% accuracy expected); rounding to $1,000 is appropriate for this estimate class
