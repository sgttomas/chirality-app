**Estimating approach:**

1. **Equipment quantities:** Parametrically estimated based on facility capacity (1,000,000 MT/annum), railcar stations (32), storage tanks (3), and operational requirements (duty/standby redundancy per OBJ-1)

2. **Equipment costs:** Parametric unit costs for API 610 pumps based on capacity and power rating; industry typical values for canola oil / vegetable oil service

3. **Installation labor:** Productivity-based (manhours per pump) using BC industrial labor rates

4. **Engineering:** Parametric hours by deliverable type and complexity

5. **Indirects, PM, Procurement, Commissioning:** Factor-based using fallback model from AGENT_ESTIMATING.md

6. **Contingency:** PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustments (10-30% by CBS bucket)

**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM (parametric estimate appropriate for budgeting; not suitable for contracting)

**Logged:** Decision D-011, Risk_Register.md Contingency Summary

---

### 7.2 Contingency Rationale

**Justification for 23.9% contingency:**

1. **High scope uncertainty (TBD quantities):**
   - All pump quantities TBD per DEL-15.03 → Risk R-001
   - Actual may be 10-18 pumps vs. estimated 14 (±30%)

2. **No vendor pricing data:**
   - 0% of costs from vendor quotes → Risk R-002
   - API 610 pump costs can vary -30% to +50% from parametric estimates

3. **Early design stage (INITIALIZED):**
   - Deliverables not yet advanced to IN_PROGRESS or CHECKING
   - Calculations not performed (DEL-15.03 pending)
   - Specifications not finalized (DEL-15.02 in draft)

4. **TBD technical requirements:**
   - Seal system complexity TBD (single vs. dual) → Risk R-005
   - Motor and VFD requirements TBD → Risk R-003
   - Food-grade material requirements TBD → Risk R-013
   - Fluid properties and heating needs TBD → Risk R-006

5. **Interface coordination risks:**
   - Multiple package interfaces (PKG-05, PKG-14, PKG-17/19, PKG-20) → Risk R-012, R-022
   - Scope boundaries not fully defined

**Contingency adequacy assessment:**
- 23.9% contingency is **appropriate for Class 4 estimate** given uncertainty level
- May be **insufficient** if multiple high-risk items materialize (combined upside could exceed contingency)
- **Recommendation:** Consider 5-10% management reserve beyond the 23.9% contingency, or re-estimate after DEL-15.03 completed

**Source:** Risk_Register.md (22 risk entries identified)

---

### 7.3 Escalation

**Escalation Mode:** NONE (per _CONFIG.md line 36)

**Implication:** Estimate is in January 2026 current dollars; no time-phased escalation applied.

**Risk:** Labor rates may escalate 3-5% per year if installation is 12-24 months in future → Risk R-009

**Logged:** Decision D-013

### 8.2 WBS → CBS Mapping Decisions

**Mapping approach:**

- **Engineering deliverables (DEL-15.01 through DEL-15.05):** Mapped to Engineering (E) based on deliverable type (drawing, specification, calculation, data sheet, record)

- **Equipment items:** Mapped to Materials (MAT) as procurement scope

- **Installation activities:** Mapped to Construction Directs (CD) as field labor

- **Testing activities:** Mapped to Commissioning (COM) per API 610 Section 6.9 performance test requirements

- **Indirects, PM, Procurement:** Derived from directs/materials using fallback factors

**Ambiguities resolved:**
- Sump pumps → MAT (permanent equipment, not temporary construction drainage) — See QA_Report.md Ambiguity 1
- VFDs → MAT (part of pump package, not electrical package) — See QA_Report.md Ambiguity 2; coordinate with PKG-17/19

---

## 12. Known Gaps and Limitations

### 12.1 Critical Data Gaps

**1. Pump quantities (HIGH IMPACT):**
- **Gap:** All pump quantities listed as TBD in deliverables

- **Impact:** ±$300,000 to $350,000 if actual quantities differ by 25-30%
- **Resolution:** Complete DEL-15.03 calculations; review ER Part 2
- **Logged:** A-001, D-005, R-001

**2. Vendor pricing (HIGH IMPACT):**
- **Gap:** No vendor quotes or budgetary proposals
- **Estimate approach:** Parametric unit costs based on industry typical values
- **Impact:** API 610 pump costs can vary -30% to +50% (±$570,000)
- **Resolution:** Solicit budgetary quotes from pump vendors
- **Logged:** A-002, R-002

**3. Pump sizing and performance (MEDIUM IMPACT):**
- **Gap:** Flow rates, heads, motor power ratings TBD per DEL-15.03 calculations
- **Estimate approach:** Typical sizing for vegetable oil transload facility

**5. Project-specific rates (MEDIUM IMPACT):**
- **Gap:** No project-specific labor rates, productivity data, or indirects/PM rates
- **Estimate approach:** BC industry typical rates and fallback model factors
- **Impact:** ±$50,000 to $100,000 if actual rates differ
- **Resolution:** Develop project rate tables; validate BC labor market rates
- **Logged:** D-010, D-014, A-006, A-007, A-008

## 20. Estimate Limitations and Disclaimers

### 20.1 Limitations

This estimate:

1. **Is not a quote or binding price.** It is a budgeting estimate for planning purposes.

2. **Has not been validated by vendor quotes.** All equipment costs are parametric and may vary significantly.

3. **Assumes TBD quantities are reasonably estimated.** Actual pump quantities TBD per DEL-15.03 calculations.

4. **Uses fallback typical model.** No project-specific rates or productivity data; using industry typical values.

5. **Does not include escalation.** Costs are in January 2026 dollars; future pricing may increase.

6. **Assumes standard contracting.** No allowance for accelerated schedule, premium time, or difficult site conditions beyond contingency.

7. **Excludes Owner's costs.** Land, permits (if Employer), financing, operations not included.

---

### 20.2 Disclaimers

- This estimate is based on **INITIALIZED deliverables** where most technical data is TBD. It should be treated as a **preliminary budgeting estimate (Class 4)**, not a definitive cost.

- **No procurement commitments** should be made based on this estimate. Vendor quotes are required before contracting.

- **Contingency (23.9%)** reflects the high uncertainty level. Even with contingency, the estimate range is wide (-30% / +50%).

- The estimate **does not constitute engineering design or specifications**. It is a cost planning artifact only.

- Estimate prepared by **automated agent** following AGENT_ESTIMATING.md instructions. Human review recommended before use.

5. Re-estimate with improved inputs

**Expected outcome:**
- Estimate confidence: LOW-MEDIUM → MEDIUM-HIGH
- Estimate class: Class 4 → Class 3
- Expected accuracy: -30%/+50% → -20%/+30%

2. Obtain firm vendor quotes (binding for 60-90 days)
3. Validate installation productivity with site-specific planning
4. Confirm project rates with EPCM and construction contractors
5. Detailed commissioning plan with hour-by-hour activities

**Expected outcome:**
- Estimate confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH → HIGH
- Estimate class: Class 3 → Class 2
- Expected accuracy: -20%/+30% → -15%/+20%
- Contingency: 18-22% → 12-18%
