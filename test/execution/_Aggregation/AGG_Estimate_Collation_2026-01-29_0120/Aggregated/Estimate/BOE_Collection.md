## Recommendations

1. Obtain vendor quotes for major cost drivers (marine demo, site facilities, security)
2. Complete hazmat survey before finalizing PKG-01 costs
3. Obtain Employer's Requirements to refine facility quantities
4. Establish project-specific rate tables for engineering/PM
5. Continue package-by-package estimating approach
