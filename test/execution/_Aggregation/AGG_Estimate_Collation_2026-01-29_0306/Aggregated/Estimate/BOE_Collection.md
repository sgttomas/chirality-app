## Latest Package: PKG-24 Security Systems

### Overview
**Total Estimate:** $1,047,000 CAD (includes contingency)
**Base Estimate:** $834,000 CAD
**Contingency:** $213,000 CAD (26% blended rate)
**Confidence:** LOW (100% allowance/parametric; no vendor quotes)

### Scope
PKG-24 covers CCTV surveillance, access control, and integration with Terminal security network.

**Deliverables (4):**
- DEL-24.01: Security System Design Drawing Set
- DEL-24.02: Security System Technical Specification
- DEL-24.03: Security System Data Sheet Package
- DEL-24.04: Security System Installation & Test Records

### Key Components
- **CCTV System:** 18 fixed IP cameras + 3 PTZ cameras, 2 NVR units, VMS software, 8 camera poles
- **Access Control:** 12 card readers, 2 controllers, software, door hardware
- **Network Infrastructure:** 4 PoE switches, fiber equipment, 3 UPS units, cabling/conduit
- **Installation:** Underground conduit, camera poles, testing/commissioning

### Cost Breakdown
- Equipment & Materials (MAT): $359,000 (43% of base)
- Construction Directs (CD): $244,000 (29% of base)
- Engineering & Design (E): $123,000 (15% of base)
- Construction Indirects (CI): $44,000 (5%)
- EPCM/PM: $37,000 (4%)
- Commissioning (COM): $19,000 (2%)
- Procurement (P): $7,000 (1%)

### Pricing Basis
- **Equipment/Materials:** 100% allowances (typical market rates for industrial IP security systems in BC Lower Mainland)
- **Labor:** Allowances based on $120-150/hr loaded labor rate for security systems technicians
- **Indirects/Services:** Factor-based (CI=18% of CD, P=2% of MAT, PM=6%, COM=3%)

### Key Assumptions (High Impact)
1. Engineering design allowance: $123,000 (1600-1900 hours @ $140-175/hr blended)
2. Cabling and conduit materials: $95,000 (Cat6A 2000-3000m, fiber 500-800m)
3. Underground conduit installation: $95,000 (400-700 LM trenching/boring)
4. Camera quantities: 18 fixed + 3 PTZ (coverage design incomplete)
5. Testing and commissioning: $65,000 (400-550 hours)

### Key Risks
1. Equipment pricing uncertainty (no vendor quotes)
2. Camera quantity uncertainty (coverage design incomplete)
3. Terminal integration complexity (protocols TBD per DEC-05)
4. Underground conduit routing coordination (PKG-03, PKG-17, PKG-25)
5. Escalation exposure (no escalation applied; 3-6% annual risk)

### Terminal Integration (DEC-05)
Terminal network interfaces treated as multiple distinct systems per DEC-05:
- **CCTV integration:** Separate video management interface with Terminal monitoring station
- **Access control integration:** Separate credential management and event reporting interface
- **Network integration:** Coordinated with PKG-25 Communications & IT for backbone

## General Estimate Basis

### Pricing Hierarchy
Across all packages, pricing sources follow this hierarchy:
1. Vendor quotes (where available)
2. Rate tables (where available)
3. Allowances (engineering judgment, typical market rates)
4. Parametric factors (indirects/services)

Most packages at Class 5 maturity rely heavily on allowances and parametric factors.

### Contingency Method
PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustments:
- E: 20% (baseline + allowance adjustment)
- MAT: 25%
- CD: 30%
- CI: 30%
- P: 15%
- PM: 15%
- COM: 30%

### Exclusions (All Packages)
- Owner's costs, land, financing
- Employer-obtained permits
- Terminal-wide infrastructure upgrades beyond Phase 1 facility interface
- Nitrogen skid (supplied by Employer per DEC-07)
- Escalation (January 2026 pricing basis)
- Taxes (GST/PST)

## Next Steps

**Next Package:** PKG-25 Communications & IT Systems
**Pipeline Progress:** 25 of ~36 packages complete (69.4%)

To improve estimate accuracy:
1. Obtain vendor quotes for equipment and materials
2. Complete design deliverables (30%, 60%, 90% milestones)
3. Develop detailed construction schedule
4. Coordinate interfaces between packages
5. Update pricing at each milestone
