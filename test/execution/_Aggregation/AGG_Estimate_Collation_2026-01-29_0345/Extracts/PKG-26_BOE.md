| **Total Base** | **$2,613,383** | — | — | — | **24.6% avg** | **$547,696** |
| **Rounded** | **$2,408,000** | — | — | — | **27%** | **$643,000** |

**Allowance share calculation:**
- E: 100% (all allowance-based)
- MAT: 70% ($1,029k allowances / $1,389k total)
- CD: 60% ($457k allowances / $762k total)

**Adjustment rules (per AGENT_ESTIMATING.md):**
- If allowance share ≥ 50%: add +5% to base contingency
- If allowance share ≥ 80%: add additional +5% (total +10%)

**Rationale:**
- Engineering (E): High uncertainty without vendor-provided data sheets; increased from 10% to 20%
- Materials (MAT): Coating pricing subject to market variation, specification uncertainty, and food-grade compliance requirements; increased from 15% to 20%
- Construction Directs (CD): Surface preparation conditions unknown, weather delays for field painting, marine access challenges; increased from 20% to 25%
- Commissioning (COM): Food-grade acceptance testing and regulatory compliance verification risk; maintained at 25%

6. **Confirm VOC compliance strategy:** Coordinate with PKG-32 on air quality permits and low-VOC coating requirements

### 13.2 Future Estimate Iterations

**To move from Class 4-5 to Class 3 (Budget):**
- Obtain vendor budgetary quotes for coating materials
- Complete coating system selection and specification
- Define surface preparation accessibility and constraints
