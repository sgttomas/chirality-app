## Executive Summary

**Package Scope:** PKG-27 Engineering Design covers all design engineering activities including design basis documents, HAZOP studies, Phase 2 expansion planning, design submission packages (30%/60%/90%/IFC), and cathodic protection design.

**Estimate Approach:** This estimate is based entirely on parametric/allowance pricing due to the absence of vendor quotes and project-specific rate tables. Engineering effort is estimated based on typical design-build project scope, multi-discipline coordination requirements, and submission milestone deliverables.

**Key Assumptions:**
- Design basis documents prepared by 5 core disciplines (Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, I&C, Marine)
- HAZOP study conducted as multi-day facilitated sessions with senior engineering participation
- Four major design submission packages (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC) requiring full coordination across disciplines
- Phase 2 expansion documentation includes concept design and feasibility engineering
- Cathodic protection design by specialist sub-consultant
- Design support during FAT/SAT and commissioning activities included

## Completeness & Limitations

**Completeness:**
- ✅ All 5 deliverables from PKG-27 are represented
- ✅ All CBS categories are included per config
- ✅ Support activities (PM, CD, CI, COM) are estimated
- ✅ Contingency applied per methodology

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ **No vendor quotes available** — all engineering rates are parametric/allowance
- ⚠️ **No project-specific rate tables** — rates are typical industry benchmarks for BC
- ⚠️ **Design scope not yet detailed** — engineering hours are estimated based on typical EPC project scope
- ⚠️ **HAZOP duration assumed** — actual HAZOP sessions may require more or fewer days depending on complexity
- ⚠️ **Cathodic Protection scope assumed** — actual CP design extent depends on geotechnical and corrosivity studies

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Obtain vendor budgetary quotes** for specialist sub-consultants (HAZOP facilitator, CP specialist) to replace allowances
2. **Develop discipline-specific engineering hour budgets** based on preliminary scope definition and design deliverable requirements
3. **Refine design submission package effort** once project schedule and submission milestone requirements are confirmed
4. **Confirm HAZOP scope and duration** with Client/Employer and adjust estimate accordingly
5. **Re-run estimate** after 30% design milestone to update based on actual progress and refined scope understanding
