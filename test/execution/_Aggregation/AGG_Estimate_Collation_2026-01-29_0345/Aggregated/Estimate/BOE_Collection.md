## PKG-31: Documentation & Deliverables

**Estimate:** $839,000 CAD (base: $755,000 + contingency: $84,000)  
**Snapshot:** EST_PKG31_DRAFT_2026-01-29_1030

### Scope Summary
- Record and as-built drawing sets (~275 sheets estimated)
- Operation manuals (12 systems) and maintenance manuals (90 equipment items)
- Vendor documentation compilation and organization
- Asset hierarchy database (CMMS-ready format)
- Warranties registers and certificates (equipment, building, MEP)
- H&S file compilation
- Document control throughout project and final submittal

### Pricing Methodology
- **Engineering (E):** Parametric based on typical production rates (12 hrs/sheet for drawings, 80 hrs/system for operation manuals, 16 hrs/equipment for maintenance manuals)
- **PM:** Parametric based on typical coordination effort (120-400 hours for various activities)
- **Materials (MAT):** Allowance-based (printing/binding, document management software)

### Key Assumptions
1. Total project drawings: 275 sheets (±30% range likely)
2. Operational systems: 12 systems
3. Major equipment count: 90 items (48% cost impact)
4. Printing/binding costs: $3,850-4,125 per drawing set, $1,100-2,200 per manual set
5. Document management software: $22,000 allowance for CMMS integration

### Confidence & Maturity
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-LOW
- **Maturity:** Class 5 (Order of Magnitude)
- **Status:** DRAFT with WARNINGS (100% parametric/allowance, no deliverable folders initialized)

### Primary Risks
1. Equipment count variance (R-002): HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact ($80k-120k variance)
2. Systems breakdown variance (R-003): MEDIUM-HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM-HIGH impact ($40k-80k variance)
3. Drawing count variance (R-001): HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM impact ($20k-30k variance)
4. Vendor documentation quality issues (R-006): MEDIUM-HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM impact ($20k-40k variance)

### Recommended Actions
1. Confirm drawing count at 30% design milestone
2. Obtain preliminary equipment list from engineering (PKG-27)
3. Confirm system breakdown with commissioning team (PKG-30)
4. Obtain vendor quotes for printing/binding services
