## PKG-00: Site Establishment

**Source:** EST_PKG00_DRAFT_2026-01-28_2315
**Package Total:** $1,727,000 CAD (base $1,434,000 + contingency $293,000)
**Deliverables:** DEL-00.01 through DEL-00.08 (8 deliverables)

### Executive Summary

This Basis of Estimate documents the methods, sources, assumptions, and decisions used to prepare the PKG-00 Site Establishment cost estimate.

**Confidence:** LOW (100% allowance-based; no vendor quotes)
**Maturity:** Class 5 (Conceptual / Order of Magnitude)

### Scope

**Package Description:** Temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates for construction staging, traffic management.

**Key Deliverables:**
- DEL-00.01: Site Establishment Design Drawing Set (4 drawings)
- DEL-00.02: Site Establishment Technical Specification (2 specs)
- DEL-00.03: Site Establishment Procedures (3 procedures)
- DEL-00.04: Contractor's Equipment Schedule (2 documents)
- DEL-00.05: Road Access & Security Process (3 plans)
- DEL-00.06: Pre-Works Road Condition Survey (2 documents)
- DEL-00.07: Post-Works Road Condition Survey (3 documents)
- DEL-00.08: Temporary Water Supply Installation Details (3 drawings)

### Estimate Basis

**Inclusions:** Engineering & Design (E), Project Management (PM), Procurement (P), Materials (MAT), Construction Directs (CD), Construction Indirects (CI), Contingency (CONT)

**Exclusions:** Owner's costs, land acquisition, permits obtained by Employer, other packages (PKG-01 through PKG-35), escalation, taxes

**Pricing Method:**
- 87.7% ALLOWANCE (fallback typical model - no vendor quotes available)
- 12.3% PARAMETRIC (factor-based calculations for indirects)
- 0% QUOTE-BASED

**Major Cost Drivers:**
1. Temporary Site Facilities & Infrastructure ($850k, 59% of base) - A-012
2. Security Gate Staffing ($180k, 13% of base) - A-013
3. Construction Indirects calculated ($85.5k, 6% of base) - factor-based
4. EPCM / PM allocation ($75.6k, 5% of base) - factor-based
5. Security Gate Installation ($75k, 5% of base) - A-011

### Key Assumptions

**Total Allowances:** $1,262,000 CAD (88% of base)

**Highest Risk Assumptions:**
- A-012: Site facilities & infrastructure ($850k, LOW confidence, ±41% range)
- A-013: Gate staffing operations ($180k, LOW confidence, ±33% range)
- A-011: Security gate installation ($75k, LOW confidence, ±33% range)

**Resolution Path:** Obtain Employer's Requirements, develop site layout (DEL-00.01), obtain vendor quotes for major components

### Key Risks

**Total Identified Risks:** 8 (R-001 through R-008)

**HIGH Priority Risks:**
- R-001: Lack of project-specific pricing sources (affects all line items)
- R-002: Missing physical quantities (affects $850k allowance)
- R-007: Scope creep in site establishment requirements

**Contingency Adequacy:** ADEQUATE for normal risks; INSUFFICIENT if multiple high-impact risks materialize simultaneously

### Contingency Breakdown

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Contingency % | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| E | $65,000 | 15% | $9,750 |
| PM | $97,630 | 15% | $14,645 |
| P | $10,400 | 15% | $1,560 |
| MAT | $520,000 | 20% | $104,000 |
| CD | $475,000 | 25% | $118,750 |
| CI | $265,500 | 25% | $66,375 |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,433,530** | **20.4%** | **$293,020** |

## Next Steps

**Pipeline Progress:** 1 of ~36 packages complete

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Obtain Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Parts 1-3)
2. Obtain vendor quotes for major cost drivers
3. Develop site layout (DEL-00.01) to quantify physical requirements
4. Establish project-specific rate tables for engineering and construction labor
5. Re-run estimates with improved data sources to reduce uncertainty
