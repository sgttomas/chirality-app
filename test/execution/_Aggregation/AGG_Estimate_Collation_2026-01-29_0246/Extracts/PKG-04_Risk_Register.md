# Risk Register

## PKG-04 Pavement & Surfacing Estimate

| ID | Risk Driver | Cause → Consequence | Affected CBS/WBS | Suggested Mitigation | Contingency Handling |
|----|-------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| R-001 | Scope - Quantities | No pavement layout drawings → Paving quantities highly uncertain | CD, MAT / PKG-04 | Develop DEL-04.01 drawings with area calculations | 30% contingency on CD; 25% on MAT |
| R-002 | Scope - Concrete Zones | Heavy load/chemical zones undefined → Concrete area may vary significantly | CD, MAT / PKG-04 | Define zone boundaries in DEL-04.01; coordinate with process requirements | 25% contingency on concrete items |
| R-003 | Price - No Quotes | No vendor quotes → All pricing via allowances with high uncertainty | All CBS | Obtain budgetary quotes from paving contractors | Elevated contingency on all buckets |
| R-004 | Productivity - Weather | Paving season limited to May-October → Schedule risk if delays occur | CD, CI / PKG-04 | Schedule paving in optimal weather window | Schedule contingency; CI factor |
| R-005 | Interface - PKG-02 | Subgrade quality from earthworks → May require additional subbase or remediation | CD, MAT / PKG-04 | Coordinate with PKG-02 for subgrade handoff criteria | Base course thickness uncertainty |
| R-006 | Interface - PKG-03 | Drainage tie-in elevations → May require grade adjustments | CD / PKG-04 | Coordinate elevations with PKG-03 catch basins and manholes | Fine grading allowance |
| R-007 | Interface - PKG-07 | Rail crossing details → Special pavement sections at track crossings | CD, MAT / PKG-04 | Coordinate with PKG-07 for rail embedment zones | Not explicitly priced; flag risk |
| R-008 | Design - Traffic Loading | Unknown traffic loads → Pavement thickness may be under/over-designed | MAT / PKG-04 | Obtain traffic study or ER loading requirements | Pavement thickness uncertainty |
| R-009 | Design - Geotechnical | Subgrade bearing capacity unknown → Pavement design may require revision | CD, MAT / PKG-04 | Coordinate with PKG-02 geotechnical investigation | Base thickness may increase |
| R-010 | OBJ-8 - Phase 2 | Expansion corridor locations undefined → Phase 2 provisions may be inadequate | CD / PKG-04 | Confirm Phase 2 corridors with Owner | OBJ-8 provisions allowance |
| R-011 | Quality - Compaction | Paving quality issues → Rework or overlays required | CD / PKG-04 | Qualified paving contractor; proper QC program | Testing allowance included |
| R-012 | Materials - Supply | Asphalt/aggregate supply constraints → Material price volatility | MAT / PKG-04 | Early procurement planning; long-term supplier agreements | 25% contingency on MAT |

## Contingency Method

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance adjustment per fallback typical model

**Basis:**
- All line items are allowances (100% allowance-based estimate)
- Per fallback model: +10% above baseline contingency for buckets with ≥80% allowance share
- Applied across all CBS buckets due to LOW confidence level
