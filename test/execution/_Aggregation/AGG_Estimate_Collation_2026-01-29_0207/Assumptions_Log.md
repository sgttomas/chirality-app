# Assumptions Log

## Overview

This log captures all assumptions and allowances made during the estimating process where quantities, rates, or scope elements required assumption due to missing source data.

---

## A-001: Unloading Arm Pricing

**Assumption:** Railcar unloading arms priced at $50,000 CAD per unit (32 units).

**Why Needed:** No vendor quotes or budgetary proposals available for unloading arms.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-10 / MAT

**Cost Impact:** $1,600,000 (total for 32 arms); range $1,440,000 - $1,920,000 (±20% based on $45k-60k/unit industry typical range)

**Confidence:** LOW

**Resolution Path:** Obtain budgetary quotes from specialized railcar unloading equipment suppliers (TechnipFMC, OPW, Emco Wheaton, Ultraflow, Civacon).

**Notes:** Articulating bottom-loading arms for food-grade service typically $45k-60k/unit depending on materials (aluminum vs stainless), reach envelope, swivel configuration, and manufacturer. Gravity flow arms are simpler than pump-assisted but still specialized equipment.

---

## A-002: Quick-Connect Coupler Pricing

**Assumption:** Quick-connect couplers priced at $3,000 CAD per unit (32 units).

**Why Needed:** No vendor quotes available; couplers may be integral to arms or separate components.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-10 / MAT

**Cost Impact:** $96,000 (total for 32 couplers); range $80,000 - $112,000 (±15% based on $2.5k-3.5k/unit typical)

**Confidence:** LOW

**Resolution Path:** Clarify if couplers are integral to unloading arms (included in arm price) or separate procurement; obtain coupler pricing from suppliers.

**Notes:** Dry-break cam-lock couplers for food-grade service typically $2.5k-3.5k/unit. If integral to arms, eliminate this line and adjust arm pricing accordingly.

---

## A-003: Header Piping Length

**Assumption:** Gravity flow header piping length estimated at 400 linear meters.

**Why Needed:** DEL-10.01 header layout drawings not yet available; piping length required for material and labor estimates.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-10 / MAT, CD

**Cost Impact:** $280,000 material + $180,000 labor = $460,000 total; range $368,000 - $552,000 (±20% based on 320-480 lm range)

**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Resolution Path:** Provide DEL-10.01 header layout drawings; measure actual piping length from layout.

**Notes:** Estimate based on: 32 stations at ~12m spacing average = ~380m main header run + ~20m for branch connections and routing = 400 lm total. Actual length depends on station spacing (per PKG-07 track layout), header routing path, and elevation changes.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-10 / MAT, CD

**Cost Impact:** $256,000 material + $144,000 labor = $400,000 total; range could vary significantly with configuration

**Confidence:** LOW

**Resolution Path:** Provide DEL-10.01 containment details drawings; verify pan configuration and regulatory compliance per DEL-10.03 calculations.

**Notes:** Individual pans provide localized containment (easier cleanup, isolated spills) but higher cost and installation complexity vs. grouped containment zones. Regulatory requirements (Environment Canada, BC regulations) drive minimum containment volume. Pan pricing assumes fabricated steel pans with drains, ~2m × 3m × 0.3m typical dimensions per station.

---

## A-005: Sump Pump Quantity

**Assumption:** 8 sump pumps for grouped containment drainage (4 pumps per zone × 2 zones).

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-10 / MAT, CD

**Cost Impact:** $48,000 material + $24,000 labor = $72,000 total; range $24,000 - $144,000 (varies with pump count 4-24)

**Confidence:** LOW

**Resolution Path:** Provide DEL-10.01 containment details drawings and DEL-10.03 drainage calculations showing pump quantity and sizing.

**Notes:** Pump quantity options: (a) 32 individual pumps (1 per pan) = highest cost/complexity; (b) grouped zones with 4-8 pumps per zone = balanced approach (assumed); (c) common containment with 1-2 pumps = lowest cost but longest drainage times and higher single-point failure risk.

| LOW | 23 | All other assumptions |

**Assumptions by category:**
- Equipment pricing: 7 assumptions (A-001, A-002, A-011, A-012, A-013)
- Material quantities: 3 assumptions (A-003, A-004, A-005)
- Engineering effort: 5 assumptions (A-006 through A-010)
- Installation labor: 8 assumptions (A-015 through A-023)
- Commissioning: 4 assumptions (A-024 through A-027)
- Site conditions: 1 assumption (A-028)

**Critical assumptions requiring resolution:**
1. **A-001** (Unloading arms $1.6M): Obtain vendor quotes — 32 specialized arms are single largest cost item
2. **A-003** (Header piping 400 lm): Verify from DEL-10.01 layout — material and labor affected
3. **A-004** (32 containment pans): Verify configuration (individual vs grouped) and regulatory requirements
4. **A-005** (8 sump pumps): Verify pump quantity from containment design

All assumptions are placeholders pending better source data (vendor quotes, rate tables, design details, regulatory requirements). Estimate confidence will improve significantly when quotes and design details are available.
