## Estimate Composition Analysis

### By Cost Type

| Cost Type | Base Cost (CAD) | % of Base | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Allowances (Direct)** | $664,000 | 91.2% | LOW |
| **Parametric Factors (Calculated)** | $64,000 | 8.8% | MED |
| **Quote-Based** | $0 | 0% | - |
| **Rate Table-Based** | $0 | 0% | - |

### By Activity Type

| Activity | Base Cost (CAD) | % of Base | Key Components |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Independent Design Verification** | $350,000 | 48.1% | IDV reviews across 8+ disciplines, 4 submission stages |
| **VFPA IP Review Coordination** | $137,300 | 18.9% | IP review responses, authority coordination |
| **Design Coordination & Integration** | $176,700 | 24.3% | Clash detection, RFI management, inter-discipline coordination |
| **QA/QC & Indirects** | $64,000 | 8.8% | Engineering oversight, procurement services |

## Key Assumptions Impact

| Assumption | Amount (CAD) | % of Base | Risk Level |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| A-001: IDV services (all disciplines/stages) | $350,000 | 48.1% | HIGH |
| A-002: Design coordination (18-24 months) | $150,000 | 20.6% | MED-HIGH |
| A-003: VFPA IP review responses | $95,000 | 13.0% | MED |
| A-004: VFPA coordination effort | $42,300 | 5.8% | MED |
| All other allowances (factors) | $90,700 | 12.5% | MED |

**Highest Risk Assumption:** A-001 (IDV services) represents 48.1% of base estimate but has LOW confidence due to undefined IDV scope (disciplines, review depth, iteration requirements).

## Contingency Breakdown

Contingency calculated using PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustment per Decision D-008.

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Allowance Share | Base Contingency % | Allowance Adjustment | Final Contingency % | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| E | $445,000 | 100% | 10% | +10% (>=80%) | **20%** | $89,000 |
| PM | $219,000 | 88% | 10% | +10% (>=80%) | **20%** | $43,800 |
| P | $8,900 | 0% | 10% | 0% | **15%** | $1,335 |
| CI | $55,100 | 0% | 20% | 0% | **25%** | $13,775 |

**Note:** Contingency percentages elevated from baseline due to high allowance share (91.2% of base uses ALLOWANCE method).

**Total Contingency:** $147,910 CAD (20.3% blended rate) -> Rounded to $164,000 (22.5%)

## Comparison to Project Context

**Project Parameters (from decomposition):**
- Facility: Canola Oil Transload Facility (1M MT/yr throughput; 45,000 MT storage)
- Contract: Design & Build
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, Surrey, BC
- Total Deliverables: 210 across 36 packages

**PKG-28 Design Verification Context:**
- Discipline: Design
- Supports Objective: OBJ-6 (Regulatory Compliance)
- Deliverable Count: 3 (smallest package count in project)
- Design verification required for all 27 engineering/construction packages

**Typical Design Verification Cost Benchmark:**
- Design verification typically 2-5% of engineering budget
- For a project with ~$10-15M engineering, $500k-$750k IDV is reasonable
- PKG-28 estimate ($892k) is at higher end, reflecting VFPA coordination complexity
