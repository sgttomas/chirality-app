# Risk Register

## PKG-07 Rail Works Estimate

| ID | Risk Driver | Cause → Consequence | Affected CBS/WBS | Suggested Mitigation | Contingency Handling |
|----|-------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| R-001 | Scope - Track Lengths | No track layout design → Track lengths highly uncertain | MAT, CD / PKG-07 | Develop track layout (DEL-07.01) to confirm actual lengths | 25-30% contingency on rail items |
| R-002 | Scope - Track 5 Restoration | No condition assessment → Restoration extent unknown | MAT, CD / PKG-07 | Complete Track 5 condition survey and assessment | 30% contingency on Track 5 items |
| R-003 | Price - No Vendor Quotes | No rail vendor quotes → All pricing via allowances | MAT, CD / PKG-07 | Obtain budgetary quotes for rail supply and installation | Elevated contingency on all buckets |
| R-004 | Scope - Interface Boundaries | Unclear scope splits with PKG-02/03/17/34 → Duplication or gap risk | All CBS / PKG-07 | Confirm scope boundaries: subgrade (PKG-02), drainage (PKG-03), electrical (PKG-17), operations (PKG-34) | Document exclusions clearly |
| R-005 | Productivity - Terminal Operations | Work near live tracks → Safety delays and access restrictions | CD, CI / PKG-07 | Coordinate work windows with terminal operations (PKG-34); night/weekend work may be required | $35k access coordination allowance; may need increase |
| R-006 | Schedule - Coordination | Track work sequencing with other packages → Schedule constraints | CD, CI / PKG-07 | Early coordination with PKG-02 (earthworks) and PKG-10 (unloading system) | Standard contingency; monitor schedule |
| R-007 | Quality - Track Geometry | Unknown geometry tolerances → Rework risk if tight tolerances required | CD / PKG-07 | Extract ER geometry requirements; confirm with rail industry standards | Testing allowance included |
| R-008 | Scope - Rail Accessories | Unknown scope for switches, signals, crossings → Potential missing scope | MAT, CD / PKG-07 | Clarify rail accessories scope in ER | Flagged as exclusion; may need addition |
| R-009 | Productivity - Ballast Placement | Poor subgrade conditions → Ballast settlement and rework | CD, MAT / PKG-07 | Ensure PKG-02 earthworks complete and verified before rail work | Coordinate with PKG-02 schedule |
| R-010 | Quality - Rail Welding | Weld quality requirements → Specialized contractor may be needed | CD / PKG-07 | Confirm rail welding requirements in DEL-07.02; prequalify contractors | Weld inspection allowance included |
| R-011 | Scope - End Stop Design | Unknown end stop functionality → Cost variance ±50% | MAT, CD / PKG-07 | Develop end stop design details; confirm hydraulic vs mechanical | $60k allowance; wide range |
| R-012 | Interface - Track Loading | Unknown railcar loads/configurations → Design criteria uncertainty | All / PKG-07 | Extract railcar parameters from ER; coordinate with PKG-10 | Design allowance includes uncertainty |

## Contingency Summary

| CBS | Base Amount | Contingency % | Contingency $ | Rationale |

| E | $45,000 | 20% | $9,000 | All allowances; scope definition risk |
| MAT | $898,000 | 25% | $224,000 | All allowances; quantity and price risk |
| CD | $468,000 | 30% | $140,000 | All allowances; productivity and coordination risk |
| CI | $84,000 | 30% | $25,000 | Factor-based from CD |
| PM | $87,000 | 15% | $13,000 | Factor-based |
| P | $18,000 | 15% | $3,000 | Factor-based |
| COM | $44,000 | 30% | $13,000 | Testing scope uncertainty |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,644,000** | **26%** | **$427,000** | Weighted average |

## Contingency Method

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance adjustment per fallback typical model

**Basis:**
- All line items are allowances (100% allowance-based estimate)
- Per fallback model: +10% above baseline contingency for buckets with ≥80% allowance share
- Applied across all CBS buckets due to LOW confidence level
