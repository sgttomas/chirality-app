## Risk Summary

This register identifies risks affecting the PKG-32 estimate and informs contingency allocation.

**Total Risks:** 8 (R-3201 through R-3208)

**Contingency Approach:** PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance-heavy adjustment (23% blended rate)

---

## R-3201: Permit Count and Scope Uncertainty

**Risk Driver:** Scope / Quantity
**Cause:** Permit list and Contractor vs Employer permit responsibility matrix not available
**Consequence:** Number of required permits unknown; permit complexity unknown; application hours may be significantly higher or lower than estimated
**Affected Buckets:** E, MAT (permit fees), CI (compliance monitoring)
**Likelihood:** HIGH (permit list is fundamental input missing)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (±30% on E and MAT buckets)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Obtain Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 3 (regulatory requirements section)
- Clarify permit responsibility matrix with Employer
- Engage regulatory consultant for preliminary permit needs assessment
**Contingency Handling:** E bucket contingency increased to 20% (from 10% baseline) to account for permit count uncertainty

---

## R-3202: Permit Condition Complexity Unknown

**Risk Driver:** Scope / Productivity
**Cause:** Issued permits not available; permit conditions not known
**Consequence:** Compliance monitoring hours (QA/QC) may be significantly higher if permits include complex or frequent monitoring/reporting conditions
**Affected Buckets:** CI (DEL-32.03-32.06)
**Likelihood:** HIGH (permits not issued; conditions unknown)
**Impact:** MEDIUM to HIGH (±40% on CI bucket)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Obtain VFPA PER approval and extract conditions
- Obtain DFO Fisheries Act authorization and extract conditions
- Obtain Transport Canada approvals and extract conditions
- Develop compliance monitoring plan with resource allocation
**Contingency Handling:** CI bucket contingency increased to 30% (from 20% baseline) to account for compliance complexity uncertainty

---

## R-3203: Authority Approval Timeline Risk

**Risk Driver:** Schedule / Interface
**Cause:** Permit approval timelines unknown and can vary widely (2 weeks to 12+ months)
**Consequence:** Delayed permit approvals may require re-engagement of consultants, additional authority follow-up, application revisions, extended project duration (impacts PM/EPCM hours)
**Affected Buckets:** PM (permit tracking), E (application revisions)
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (typical for complex industrial/marine projects)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (may add 10-30% to PM hours)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Develop early permit acquisition schedule
- Identify long-lead permits (VFPA PER, DFO, environmental permits) and prioritize early submission
- Engage consultants early for application quality assurance
- Maintain regular authority liaison and follow-up
**Contingency Handling:** PM bucket contingency set to 15% to cover potential timeline extensions and re-engagement

---

## R-3204: Regulatory Consultant Scope Creep

**Risk Driver:** Scope / Price
**Cause:** Consultant scope not clearly defined; regulatory requirements may expand during project
**Consequence:** Consultant hours may exceed allowance if scope expands (e.g., authority requests for additional studies, application revisions, appeals)
**Affected Buckets:** E (consultant support)
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (typical for complex regulatory environments)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (consultant costs may increase 20-50% if scope expands)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Engage consultant with clear scope definition and not-to-exceed fee structure
- Include scope change process in consultant contract
- Monitor consultant hours against budget
**Contingency Handling:** E bucket contingency set to 20% to cover potential consultant scope expansion

---

## R-3205: Permit Fee Escalation

**Risk Driver:** Price
**Cause:** Permit fee schedules not obtained; fees may be higher than allowance
**Consequence:** Permit fees may exceed $25k allowance if project includes more permits or higher fees than estimated
**Affected Buckets:** MAT (permit fees)
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (fee schedules authority-dependent)
**Impact:** LOW to MEDIUM (fees may increase 20-100% if multiple major permits required)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Obtain fee schedules from all applicable authorities (VFPA, DFO, Transport Canada, City of Surrey, fire authority)
- Clarify Contractor vs Employer fee responsibility
**Contingency Handling:** MAT bucket contingency set to 25% to cover permit fee uncertainty

---

## R-3206: Resource Rate Escalation

**Risk Driver:** Price
**Cause:** Labor rates and consultant rates based on typical industry rates (no project-specific rates)
**Consequence:** Actual rates may be higher than estimated ($125/hr engineering, $100/hr PM, $200/hr consultant) due to market conditions, specialty requirements, or location
**Affected Buckets:** E, CI, PM
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (labor market conditions uncertain)
**Impact:** LOW to MEDIUM (±10-20% rate variance)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Obtain project-specific labor rate tables
- Obtain consultant budgetary quotes
- Update estimate when rates are confirmed
**Contingency Handling:** Contingency rates include 5-10% buffer for rate escalation across all buckets

---

## R-3207: Coordination and Interface Complexity

**Risk Driver:** Interface / Productivity
**Cause:** PKG-32 interfaces with all other packages (permit applications require drawings, specs, calculations from PKG-01 through PKG-31); interface complexity may require additional coordination hours
**Consequence:** Increased PM/engineering hours for cross-package coordination, design maturity tracking, information requests
**Affected Buckets:** PM, E
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (typical for multi-discipline projects)
**Impact:** LOW to MEDIUM (may add 10-20% to coordination hours)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Establish clear interface protocol and information flow process
- Define design maturity requirements for each permit type
- Schedule regular coordination meetings
**Contingency Handling:** PM bucket contingency set to 15% to cover interface coordination complexity

---

## R-3208: Employer's Requirements Interpretation Risk

**Risk Driver:** Scope / Interface
**Cause:** Employer's Requirements not accessible during estimate preparation; permit requirements and responsibility splits may differ from assumptions
**Consequence:** Actual Contractor permit scope may be larger or smaller than estimated; Employer may require additional submittals, reviews, or approvals not anticipated
**Affected Buckets:** E, PM, CI, MAT
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (ER documents not reviewed)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (±20-30% on overall package scope)
**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Obtain and review Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 3 (regulatory section) immediately
- Clarify all permit-related requirements and responsibility splits with Employer at project kickoff
- Confirm Employer review/approval requirements for permit applications
**Contingency Handling:** Overall contingency blended rate (23%) provides buffer for ER interpretation differences; recommend early ER review to reduce this risk
