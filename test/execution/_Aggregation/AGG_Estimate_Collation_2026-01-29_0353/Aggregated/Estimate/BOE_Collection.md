## PKG-32: Regulatory & Permits

**Estimate:** $338,000 CAD (base: $274,000 + contingency: $64,000)  
**Snapshot:** EST_PKG32_DRAFT_2026-01-29_0016

### Scope Summary
- Permit applications for regulatory authorities (VFPA PER, DFO, Transport Canada, building, fire, environmental)
- Regulatory/environmental consultant support for complex compliance environment
- Permit fees for Contractor-responsible permits
- Permit receipt, tracking, and compliance management
- Compliance monitoring and documentation (VFPA, DFO, Transport Canada, code)
- Authority correspondence register and filing
- Certificate of occupancy and regulatory closeout

### Pricing Methodology
- **Engineering (E):** Allowance-based ($75k permit applications + $60k consultant support)
- **CI:** Allowance-based ($90k compliance monitoring across 4 authorities)
- **MAT:** Allowance-based ($25k permit fees)
- **PM, P, COM:** Parametric factors (6%, 2%, 3% of directs)

### Key Assumptions
1. Permit count: 5-8 major permits estimated (VFPA PER, DFO, TC, building, environmental, fire)
2. Engineering hours: 600 hours @ $125/hr for permit applications
3. Consultant support: 300 hours @ $200/hr for regulatory specialists
4. Compliance monitoring: 200-240 hours per authority for QA/QC documentation
5. Permit fees: $25k allowance for Contractor-responsible permits (excludes Employer permits)

### Confidence & Maturity
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Maturity:** Class 5 (Order of Magnitude)
- **Status:** DRAFT with WARNINGS (85% allowance-based, no vendor quotes)
- **Primary Gap:** Permit responsibility matrix TBD, issued permits not available

### Primary Risks
1. Permit count and scope uncertainty (R-3201): HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM impact
2. Permit condition complexity (R-3202): HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM-HIGH impact
3. Authority approval timeline variability (R-3203): MEDIUM likelihood, MEDIUM impact
4. Regulatory consultant scope creep (R-3204): MEDIUM likelihood, MEDIUM impact

### Recommended Actions
1. Obtain Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 3 (regulatory requirements)
2. Clarify permit responsibility matrix (Contractor vs Employer)
3. Engage regulatory/environmental consultant for preliminary scope and budget
4. Obtain permit fee schedules from all applicable authorities
5. Develop compliance monitoring resource plan once permits are issued
