## Estimate Basis

### Package Scope Interpretation

**PKG-27 Engineering Design** is the "umbrella" design package that covers:
1. **Design Basis Development:** Multi-discipline design basis documents that establish project-wide design criteria (not discipline-specific design calculations which are embedded in PKG-01 through PKG-26)
2. **HAZOP Studies:** Hazard and operability studies conducted as facilitated multi-discipline review sessions
3. **Phase 2 Planning:** Forward-looking feasibility engineering and concept design for future expansion
4. **Design Submission Coordination:** Compilation, coordination, and formatting of design packages at major milestones (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC)
5. **Specialty Design:** Cathodic protection design (a cross-discipline specialty requiring sub-consultant expertise)

**Source:** Decomposition PKG-27 scope (line 604-618); ASSUMPTION: deliverable folders not yet scaffolded, so relying on decomposition scope only.

**Decision D-001:** Scope interpretation — Design Basis Documents are interpreted as project-wide multi-discipline design basis memoranda (not discipline-specific design calculations). Discipline-specific design is assumed to be covered under the respective discipline packages (PKG-01 through PKG-26). This interpretation is based on typical design-build project structure where "design basis" refers to high-level criteria and assumptions, not detailed calculations. **Evidence:** Decomposition lists "Design basis memorandum, design criteria" as anticipated artifacts for DEL-27.01.

## Estimating Methodology

### Approach

This estimate is **parametric/allowance-based** due to the absence of vendor quotes and project-specific rate tables.

**Method:**
1. Estimated engineering hours for each deliverable based on typical design-build project scope and complexity
2. Applied blended engineering hourly rates (fully-burdened, including overhead and profit)
3. Created lump-sum allowances for deliverables where hour-by-hour breakdown is not yet supported by detailed scope definition
4. Applied indirects and support factors per fallback model
5. Applied contingency per PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustment

### WBS-to-CBS Mapping

| WBS Deliverable | Primary CBS | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| DEL-27.01 | E | Design basis documents are engineering deliverables |
| DEL-27.02 | E | HAZOP study is engineering analysis activity |
| DEL-27.03 | E | Phase 2 feasibility is engineering analysis and concept design |
| DEL-27.04 | E | Design submission package coordination is engineering activity |
| DEL-27.05 | E | Cathodic protection design is specialty engineering |
| Support Activities | PM, P, CD, CI, COM | Cross-deliverable support activities per CBS definitions |

**Decision D-010:** All PKG-27 deliverables are mapped to Engineering (E) CBS category because this package is exclusively design engineering work. Support activities (PM, CD, CI, COM) are assigned to their respective CBS categories per standard project structure.

---

## Indirects & Support Activities

### Project Management (PM)

**Scope:** Design coordination and oversight across all disciplines; design review facilitation; approval coordination; submission tracking; client interface management.

**Basis:** 11.5% of Engineering (E) base = $130,000 CAD.

**Rationale (D-009):** PM factor is higher than typical fallback model (6%) due to the multi-discipline coordination complexity inherent in PKG-27 scope (design basis across 5 disciplines, HAZOP facilitation, four major design submission milestones). Typical PM factor for design-only packages ranges 8-12% depending on coordination intensity.

### Procurement (P)

**Scope:** HAZOP session logistics (materials, venue booking, catering coordination).

**Basis:** Allowance of $2,000 CAD — **A-020**.

### Construction Directs (CD)

**Scope:** Design representative attendance at Factory Acceptance Tests (FAT) and Site Acceptance Tests (SAT) to provide design authority approval.

**Basis:** 120 hours @ $145/hr = $17,400 CAD — **A-021**.

**Assumption:** Estimated 15 days of FAT/SAT attendance across the project (major equipment systems requiring design engineer presence for acceptance).

### Construction Indirects (CI)

**Scope:** Field engineering coordination during construction; RFI response support; design clarification support.

**Basis:** Allowance of $25,000 CAD — **A-022**.

**Rationale:** Ongoing engineering support during construction phase for RFIs, field clarifications, and coordination with construction team.

### Commissioning (COM)

**Scope:** Design verification during commissioning activities; troubleshooting support; performance validation.

**Basis:** 80 hours @ $165/hr = $13,200 CAD — **A-023**.

**Assumption:** Engineering support during commissioning phase to verify design intent and support troubleshooting.

## Contingency Methodology

### Method: PCT_BY_BUCKET

**Rationale (D-011):** PCT_BY_BUCKET method selected per config default. This method applies baseline contingency percentages by CBS category, with adjustments for allowance-heavy buckets.

### Baseline Contingency Percentages (from fallback model)

| CBS | Baseline % | Allowance-Heavy Adjustment | Applied % | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| E | 10% | +2% | 12% | AllowanceShare = 71% (>50% triggers +2% adjustment); engineering design has inherent scope uncertainty |
| PM | 10% | +2% | 12% | AllowanceShare = 100% (>50% triggers +2% adjustment) |
| P | 15% | +2% | 17% | AllowanceShare = 100% (>50% triggers +2% adjustment) |
| CD | 20% | 0% | 20% | AllowanceShare = 100% but standard CD contingency already accounts for execution variability |
| CI | 20% | 0% | 20% | AllowanceShare = 100% but standard CI contingency already accounts for execution variability |
| COM | 25% | 0% | 25% | AllowanceShare = 100% but standard COM contingency already accounts for commissioning variability |

**AllowanceShare Calculation:**
- Engineering (E): 17 allowance lines / 18 total E lines = 94% allowance/parametric
- PM, P, CD, CI, COM: 100% allowance/parametric (all lines are allowances)

**Total Contingency:** $141,000 CAD (12.5% weighted average of base estimate).

**Source:** Fallback model contingency defaults (AGENT_ESTIMATING.md lines 676-697); AllowanceShare adjustment per STRUCTURE section.

---

## Escalation

**Escalation Mode:** NONE (per config default).

**Pricing Date:** January 2026 (current dollars).

**Rationale:** No escalation applied. Estimate is in current-dollar terms as of pricing date.

---

## Rounding Policy

**Rounding:** Nearest $1,000 CAD (per config).

**Application:** Applied to final total estimate only. Base estimate and contingency subtotals are not rounded; only the final total is rounded per policy.

**Total Estimate (pre-rounding):** $1,272,800 CAD
**Total Estimate (rounded):** $1,273,000 CAD

---

## Completeness Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deliverables with line items | 5 of 5 (100%) |
| Line items priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| Line items priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| Line items priced by PARAMETRIC | 29.2% (7 line items) |
| Line items priced by ALLOWANCE | 70.8% (17 line items) |
| Deliverables with explicit quantities | 40% (2 of 5: HAZOP and CP design have hour-based quantities) |

**Completeness Assessment:** This estimate is **allowance-heavy** with no vendor quotes or project-specific rate tables available. Confidence is LOW. Parametric pricing is based on industry typical engineering rates and effort factors for Greater Vancouver design-build projects.

---

## Known Gaps & Limitations

1. **No vendor quotes available** — All engineering rates are parametric/allowance based on industry benchmarks
2. **No project-specific rate tables** — Rates are typical for BC engineering market but not project-specific
3. **Design scope not yet detailed** — Engineering hour estimates are based on typical design-build project scope; actual hours will depend on design complexity and Employer review requirements
4. **HAZOP duration assumed** — Actual HAZOP sessions may require more or fewer days depending on facility complexity and number of process nodes identified
5. **Cathodic Protection scope assumed** — Actual CP design extent depends on geotechnical studies, corrosivity testing, and marine structures final design
6. **Design submission package effort assumed** — Actual coordination effort depends on drawing count, review cycle duration, and Employer comment volume at each milestone
7. **Phase 2 scope uncertainty** — Phase 2 expansion documentation effort depends on Employer's Phase 2 planning requirements (concept-level vs. detailed feasibility)

---

## Risk Factors Affecting Estimate

See `Risk_Register.md` for detailed risk register.

**Key risks:**
- **R-001:** HAZOP duration and participant count uncertainty
- **R-002:** Design submission milestone schedule compression
- **R-003:** Employer review comment volume and rework cycles
- **R-004:** Phase 2 expansion scope uncertainty (concept vs. detailed feasibility)
- **R-005:** Cathodic protection design complexity (marine structures, buried pipe extent)
- **R-006:** Multi-discipline coordination complexity (5 core disciplines + specialty)
- **R-007:** Third-party approvals and review cycles (VFPA, authorities)
- **R-008:** Design basis interpretation and Employer acceptance
