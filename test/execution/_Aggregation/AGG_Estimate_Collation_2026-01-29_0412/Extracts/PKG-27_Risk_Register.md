## R-001: HAZOP Duration and Participant Count Uncertainty

**Risk Driver:** Scope/Quantity

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** HAZOP study duration and participant count are estimated based on typical bulk liquid transload facility complexity (5 days, 5 disciplines). Actual HAZOP scope depends on process node count, hazard complexity, and Employer/Authority requirements which are not yet defined.
- **Consequence:** If actual HAZOP requires 7-10 days or additional specialist participation (safety consultant, fire protection, environmental), cost could increase by $20,000-$50,000.

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.02

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Conduct preliminary HAZOP scoping session with project team to identify process nodes and expected hazards
2. Obtain budgetary quote from HAZOP facilitator with scope assumptions clearly documented
3. Confirm Employer/Authority HAZOP requirements early in design phase

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket partially accounts for this risk. If HAZOP scope expands significantly, may require change order.

## R-002: Design Submission Milestone Schedule Compression

**Risk Driver:** Schedule

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Design submission packages estimated assuming typical milestone spacing (3-4 months between 30%/60%/90%/IFC submissions). If project schedule is compressed, coordination effort increases due to parallel discipline work and reduced review time.
- **Consequence:** Schedule compression could increase design submission coordination effort by 20-30% ($95,000-$143,000 increase).

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.04

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Confirm project schedule and design milestone dates early
2. Ensure adequate inter-discipline coordination resources if schedule is compressed
3. Consider BIM/3D coordination tools to improve efficiency if schedule is tight

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket provides partial buffer. Significant schedule compression may require change order or scope reduction.

---

## R-003: Employer Review Comment Volume and Rework Cycles

**Risk Driver:** Interface/External Dependency

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Design submission package effort assumes typical Employer review cycles (one round of comments per submission with moderate rework). If Employer provides extensive comments or requires multiple review iterations, rework effort increases.
- **Consequence:** Extensive Employer comments or multiple review cycles could increase design submission effort by 15-25% ($71,000-$119,000 increase).

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.04

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Establish clear design review and comment resolution process with Employer early
2. Conduct pre-submission review meetings to align on design approach before formal submissions
3. Track Employer comment volume and rework effort to inform future estimates

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket provides partial buffer. Extensive rework may require schedule extension or change order.

---

## R-004: Phase 2 Expansion Scope Uncertainty

**Risk Driver:** Scope

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Phase 2 expansion documentation scope is assumed to be concept-level (general arrangement drawing + feasibility memo). Employer may require more detailed feasibility engineering including detailed cost estimate, schedule, risk assessment, or preliminary design.
- **Consequence:** If Phase 2 scope expands to detailed feasibility or preliminary design, cost could increase by $50,000-$120,000.

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.03

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Clarify Phase 2 documentation requirements with Employer early (concept vs. detailed feasibility vs. preliminary design)
2. Define Phase 2 deliverable expectations in contract or scope definition document
3. If detailed Phase 2 work is required, consider separating as optional scope or future phase

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket provides partial buffer. Major scope expansion would require change order.

---

## R-005: Cathodic Protection Design Complexity

**Risk Driver:** Scope/Productivity

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Cathodic protection design scope assumes marine structures and buried/submerged piping. Actual CP scope depends on geotechnical conditions, corrosivity testing results, and final design of structures requiring protection. If soil resistivity is low or corrosivity is high, CP system complexity increases.
- **Consequence:** High corrosivity environment or complex CP system configuration (multiple rectifiers, deep groundbeds, shielded structures) could increase CP design cost by $20,000-$50,000.

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.05

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Conduct geotechnical investigation and corrosivity testing early in design phase
2. Obtain budgetary quote from CP specialist with scope assumptions clearly documented
3. Consider CP design as optional scope pending geotechnical/corrosivity study results

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket provides partial buffer. Significant CP scope expansion may require change order.

---

## R-006: Multi-Discipline Coordination Complexity

**Risk Driver:** Interface

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** PKG-27 requires coordination across 5 core disciplines (Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, I&C, Marine) plus specialty consultants (HAZOP, CP). If disciplines are not co-located or using incompatible design tools, coordination effort increases.
- **Consequence:** Poor coordination tools or dispersed design team could increase design basis and submission coordination effort by 10-20% ($60,000-$120,000 increase).

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / multiple deliverables; Project Management (PM)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Establish common design platform (BIM, CAD standards, document management system) early
2. Co-locate design team if possible, or establish regular coordination meetings if dispersed
3. Assign dedicated design coordination lead role to manage inter-discipline interfaces
4. Use clash detection and 3D coordination tools to reduce rework

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket and PM bucket provides partial buffer. Significant coordination issues may require schedule extension or additional PM resources.

---

## R-007: Third-Party Approvals and Review Cycles

**Risk Driver:** External Dependency

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Design submissions may require third-party approvals (VFPA, Transport Canada, environmental authorities, etc.) which are outside contractor control. If approval cycles are lengthy or authorities require design changes, schedule and effort increase.
- **Consequence:** Lengthy approval cycles or authority-mandated design changes could increase design submission effort by 10-15% ($48,000-$71,000 increase) and delay project schedule.

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.04; Project Management (PM)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Identify all third-party approval requirements early and initiate pre-consultation where possible
2. Build approval cycle time into project schedule (assume 4-6 weeks minimum per authority)
3. Track authority comments and design changes required, and escalate early if scope expands significantly
4. Consider engaging authority representatives in HAZOP study to align on safety approach

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket and PM bucket provides partial buffer. Significant authority-mandated changes may require schedule extension or change order.

## R-008: Design Basis Interpretation and Employer Acceptance

**Risk Driver:** Interface/Scope

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Design basis documents establish project-wide design criteria. If Employer has different expectations for design basis content, level of detail, or format, rework may be required.
- **Consequence:** Design basis rework due to misaligned expectations could increase DEL-27.01 cost by 20-30% ($43,000-$65,000 increase).

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / DEL-27.01

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Provide Employer with design basis outline and table of contents for review/approval before detailed drafting
2. Reference industry standards (e.g., ASCE, ASME, IEEE) for design basis documentation format and content
3. Conduct early design basis review meeting with Employer to align on expectations

**Contingency Handling:** 12% contingency applied to E bucket provides partial buffer. Major rework may require schedule extension.

---

## R-009: Engineering Rate Escalation

**Risk Driver:** Price

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** Estimate uses January 2026 engineering rates. If design work extends into late 2026 or 2027, labor rates may escalate due to inflation or tight labor market conditions.
- **Consequence:** Engineering rate escalation of 3-5% annually could increase total E cost by $28,000-$47,000 per year of schedule extension.

**Affected Buckets:** All CBS categories (primarily Engineering (E) and PM)

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Negotiate fixed-price or rate-capped engineering services contracts with sub-consultants
2. Monitor labor market conditions and escalate early if rates increase significantly
3. Consider escalation provision in contract if multi-year design phase expected

**Contingency Handling:** Escalation is excluded per config (escalation_mode: NONE). This risk is not covered by base estimate or contingency. If escalation occurs, may require change order or contract price adjustment.

---

## R-010: Scope Creep — Additional Design Deliverables

**Risk Driver:** Scope

**Cause → Consequence:**
- **Cause:** PKG-27 scope is defined based on decomposition (5 deliverables). If additional design deliverables are required (e.g., risk assessments, environmental studies, constructability reviews, value engineering studies), scope expands.
- **Consequence:** Each additional major design deliverable could add $30,000-$80,000 to the estimate depending on complexity.

**Affected Buckets:** Engineering (E) / new deliverables not yet defined

**Suggested Mitigation:**
1. Confirm PKG-27 scope and deliverable list with Employer early, and clearly define scope exclusions
2. If additional design deliverables are identified, issue change order request before starting work
3. Track scope changes and maintain clear change order log

**Contingency Handling:** Contingency is not intended to cover scope additions. Additional deliverables require change order.
