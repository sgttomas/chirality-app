## 4. Pricing Sources and Methods

### 4.1 Pricing Method Distribution

| Method | Line Items | % of Items | Remarks |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| ALLOWANCE | 689 | 79.5% | Lump-sum placeholders without vendor validation |
| PARAMETRIC | 154 | 17.8% | Factor-based calculations (indirects, PM, etc.) |
| RATE_TABLE | 11 | 1.3% | Limited rate table pricing |
| QUOTE | 0 | 0% | No vendor quotes available |
| **TOTAL** | **867** | **100%** | |

### 4.2 Source Availability

| Source Type | Status | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Employer's Requirements | Not Available | Cannot validate scope assumptions |
| Vendor Quotes | Not Available | All equipment costs are allowances |
| Project Rate Tables | Limited | Some labor rates available |
| Historical Data | Not Available | No benchmarking possible |
| Deliverable Documents | Available | 202 deliverables documented |

### 4.3 Pricing Method Rationale

Due to the absence of project-specific pricing sources:

1. **Equipment and Materials:** Priced using ALLOWANCE method based on typical industrial facility costs
2. **Engineering Deliverables:** Priced using typical hours × assumed rates
3. **Construction Labor:** Priced using parametric factors or regional rate assumptions
4. **Indirects:** Calculated as percentage factors per typical EPC ratios

**Source Index:** Complete source discovery findings documented in `Source_Index.csv`

---

## 5. Common Parameters

### 5.1 Currency

**Currency:** CAD (Canadian dollars)

All costs expressed in Canadian dollars. No foreign currency conversion required for this estimate.

### 5.2 Pricing Date

**Pricing Date:** January 2026

All costs represent "dollars of" January 2026. Escalation not applied.

### 5.3 Location Factors

**Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, Surrey, BC (Lower Mainland)

**Labor Market Assumptions:**
- BC Lower Mainland labor rates (Vancouver/Surrey area)
- Union and non-union labor mix assumed
- Typical industrial construction productivity

**Site-Specific Factors:**
- Marine terminal location with road and rail access
- Active terminal operations require coordination
- Potential productivity impacts from operational interface

### 5.4 Escalation

**Escalation Mode:** NONE (not applied)

**Rationale:**
- Construction schedule with cashflow curve not available
- Draft estimate maturity does not warrant escalation precision
- Escalation exposure documented as project risk (RSK-ESC-003)

**Escalation Exposure:** If construction spans 24-30 months, cumulative escalation could add 6-15% (~$6M - $14M) to project cost.

---

## 6. Indirects Model

### 6.1 Factor-Based Approach

**Model Type:** Factor-based (default per AGENT_ESTIMATING fallback model)

**Rationale:** Construction schedule with detailed durations not available; factor-based model appropriate for conceptual estimate maturity.

### 6.2 Standard Factors Applied

| Indirect Category | Factor | Basis | Project Amount |
|-------------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Construction Indirects (CI) | 18% | Construction Directs (CD) | $5.8M |
| Project Management (PM) | 6% | CD + CI + MAT | $5.8M |
| Procurement Services (P) | 2% | Materials (MAT) | $0.9M |

### 6.3 Indirects Components

**Construction Indirects include:**
- Field supervision and construction management
- Site overhead and temporary facilities operations
- QA/QC and inspection
- HSE and safety management
- Small tools and consumables

**Project Management includes:**
- Project controls (schedule, cost, change management)
- Contract administration
- Engineering management
- Stakeholder coordination
- Document control

## 7. Contingency Summary

### 7.1 Method

**Contingency Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by CBS bucket)

**Rationale:** Risk-based three-point estimation not feasible without vendor quotes and project-specific risk data. Percentage-by-bucket method appropriate for conceptual estimate with high allowance content.

### 7.2 Contingency by CBS

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Contingency Rate | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| E | $8,640,165 | 15% | $1,296,000 |
| PM | $5,821,748 | 15% | $873,000 |
| P | $921,946 | 15% | $138,000 |
| MAT | $41,045,785 | 20% | $8,209,000 |
| FRT | $233,000 | 20% | $47,000 |
| CD | $26,933,520 | 25% | $6,733,000 |
| CI | $5,816,043 | 25% | $1,454,000 |
| COM | $3,004,199 | 30% | $901,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$92,416,406** | **~26.7%** | **~$24.7M** |

### 7.3 Contingency Adequacy

**Assessment:** Contingency allocation is appropriate for Class 5 conceptual estimate.

**Adequate for:**
- Normal project risks and moderate scope adjustments
- Typical pricing variability within ±20% of allowances
- Standard execution risks

**Potentially Insufficient for:**
- Multiple high-impact risks materializing simultaneously
- Major scope growth from ER requirements
- Significant escalation over extended schedule
- Geotechnical or environmental surprises

**Recommendation:** Re-assess contingency as estimate matures with vendor quotes and ER requirements.

## 11. Known Gaps and Limitations

### 11.1 Critical Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Resolution |
|-----|--------|------------|
| No vendor quotes | All equipment costs are allowances; ±30% uncertainty | Vendor engagement program |
| Physical quantities TBD | Cannot create detailed QTO; forced to use lump sums | Site layout development |
| Employer's Requirements not available | Cannot validate scope/spec assumptions | ER document review |
| Construction schedule not available | Time-based costs rely on duration assumptions | Schedule development |
| No benchmarking data | Estimate not validated against similar projects | Industry benchmark study |

### 11.2 Estimate Limitations

1. **Single-point estimates:** Ranges documented but deterministic values shown
2. **No sensitivity analysis:** Impact of varying assumptions not quantified
3. **No probabilistic analysis:** Monte Carlo or risk-adjusted estimates not performed
4. **Limited scope definition:** Many deliverable quantities marked "TBD"

### 11.3 Accuracy Statement

**Expected Accuracy Range:** -30% / +50%

This means:
- Actual costs could be as low as $82M (30% below base)
- Actual costs could be as high as $139M (50% above base)
- Most likely range: $100M - $130M
