# Specification: DEL-03.04 Underground Utilities Data Sheet Package

## Scope
Defines and substantiates the data required to describe underground utilities, covering oil-water separator components and pipe materials for PKG-03 per the Employer's Requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:201).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Present tabulated data for OWS components (sizes, retention capacity, instrumentation, maintenance access) that align with the containment strategy (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Document pipe material properties, coatings, and jointing methods for all duct banks and other underground conduits.
- Include testing/inspection requirements for materials (e.g., hydrostatic, cathodic protection) so QA/QC teams can verify compliance.
- Align the data sheet structure with the Guidance principles for environmental protection and operational clarity so that the Specification communicates why each data point exists (Guidance.md: Principles).

### Performance Requirements
- Data sheets must reference the performance expectations in Volume 2 Part 2 of the Employer's Requirements, ensuring materials support permitted throughput and containment objectives.
- Ensure the data accounts for environmental exposures (corrosion, abrasion) as described in the decomposition's environmental protection scope (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).

### Interface Requirements
- Confirm data formats meet the CAD and specification templates used by DEL-03.01 and DEL-03.02.
- Align material selection with Installation & Test Records (DEL-03.05) so field verification is consistent with the documented data.
- Reference Procedure.md steps to confirm that the documented material data is reviewed and signed off prior to inclusion in the Drawing Set references.

### Quality Requirements
- Each data sheet must include verification checkpoints (submittal reviews, QA signatures) consistent with Volume 2 Part 1 Quality Management Plan.
- Retain records of supplier data, certificates, and test reports referenced in the data sheet.

## Standards
- Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 outlines acceptable materials and equipment for underground utilities (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Document control and QA standards are drawn from Volume 2 Part 1 (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Verification
- Verification includes data cross-checks against supplier documentation, QA review of material submittals, and independent sign-off on critical components.
- Capture verification outcomes in the project's QA log and include them with the final data sheet package.
- Feed the verification status into Datasheet.md so that metadata reflects the review state before issuing to DEL-03.05 and DEL-03.01.

## Documentation
- Artifacts: OWS data sheet, pipe material data sheets (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Include reference tables linking each data sheet to the requirement it satisfies and to the related drawing/specification deliverables.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Confirmation of data headings and subjects in the Datasheet makes the Specification traceable to actual table contents (Datasheet.md: Construction).
- Guidance: The Guidance Principles explain the rationale behind including environmental protection and inspection details, so they inform why the Specification mandates those columns (Guidance.md: Principles, Considerations).
- Procedure: Verification steps referenced in Procedure.md ensure the Spec sections are checked before data sheets are released, creating a documented trail (Procedure.md: Verification).
