# Procedure: DEL-03.04 Underground Utilities Data Sheet Package

## Purpose
- Define the workflow for creating, verifying, and releasing data sheets that substantiate underground utilities design choices for PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:201).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm inputs from DEL-03.02 (Specification), DEL-03.03 (Calculations), and DEL-03.01 (Drawings).
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works), Volume 2 Part 1 (Quality Management Plan), package reference index in `execution/PKG-03_Underground_Utilities_and_Drainage/0_References/_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
- **Data inputs:** Material submittals, calculation outputs, manufacturer data, and QA requirements.
- **Personnel:** Civil specifier/data sheet preparer and QA reviewer (ASSUMPTION: per Quality Management Plan).

## Steps
1. Review `_CONTEXT.md` to confirm the intended artifacts (OWS data sheet, pipe material data sheets) and the scope of materials to cover, referencing Guidance.md trade-offs to ensure clarity of detail.
2. Gather performance data from DEL-03.03 calculations and supplier data to populate capacities, pressures, and coatings; flag any deviations in Procedure.md so the Datasheet attributes can list them (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
3. Draft data sheets using the project's template, grouping information by system (e.g., OWS, storm drainage conduits, duct banks) and ensuring Specification requirements are present (Specification.md: Functional Requirements).
4. Include verification checkpoints (e.g., testing requirements) directly within the data sheet tables as required by Procedure and Specification processes.
5. Route completed data sheets through QA/QC review, record comments, and capture approvals in the document control log, then update the Datasheet metadata to reflect the review status.
6. Issue the data sheets to the document register for use by procurement, installation, and compliance teams.

## Verification
- Review each data sheet against the specification (DEL-03.02) to ensure completeness.
- Validate material properties with supplier test reports and confirm alignment with Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 2).
- Record QA sign-offs within the project document control system so the Datasheet metadata captures the approval status.

## Records
- Final data sheets, revision histories, QA checklists, and reference data (calculations, supplier certificates).
- Traceability tables linking each data sheet row to the requirement it satisfies and to the original reference documents.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Procedure’s verification steps ensure the Datasheet metadata and records capture the approvals listed in Datasheet.md (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Each step explains which Specification requirement it makes real, ensuring the data sheets satisfy the clauses (Specification.md: Verification).
- Guidance: The Guidance trade-offs provide the rationale for focusing on certain materials/data, so Procedure references them when describing QA focus areas (Guidance.md: Trade-offs).
