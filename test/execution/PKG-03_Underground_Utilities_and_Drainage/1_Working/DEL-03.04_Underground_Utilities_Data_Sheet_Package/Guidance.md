# Guidance: DEL-03.04 Underground Utilities Data Sheet Package

## Purpose
- Steer the development of data sheets that substantiate underground utilities performance, materials, and testing for PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:201).
- Ensure each data sheet ties back to the specification and drawing deliverables so that materials and equipment selections are traceable.

## Principles
- Use consistent templates so data sheets across OWS, duct banks, and storm drainage components share the same structure for easy comparison.
- Align the template with the Specification requirements to illustrate why each material/data point is captured and how it supports the Drawing Set (Specification.md: Functional Requirements).
- Emphasize environmental protection data (containment volumes, materials resistant to hydrocarbon exposure) because PKG-03 ties to OBJ-7 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Document testing requirements (pressure, coating inspections) adjacent to material property tables to clarify QA expectations.
 
## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Ensure the Datasheet includes the attributes and verification details described here so reviewers can see how the Guidance trade-offs shaped the data selection (Datasheet.md: Construction, Conditions).
- Specification: Guidance principles validate why the Specification needs those functional/performance/interface clauses, giving context for each requirement (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Procedure: The Procedure verification steps rely on the Guidance’s inspection priorities to know which data sheet entries must be validated (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).

## Considerations
- Leverage results from the design calculations (DEL-03.03) to populate capacities, flow rates, and sizing values in the data sheets (ASSUMPTION: calculations feed data sheets).
- Coordinate with the specification (DEL-03.02) to ensure the data sheets include all required materials and workmanship descriptions.
- Validate QA checkpoints listed in Procedure.md so that data sheet reviewers can confirm compliance before packaging records (Procedure.md: Steps).
- Confirm data format compliance with the project's document control procedures in Volume 2 Part 1 (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Trade-offs
- Balance the thoroughness of material properties with the need to keep data sheets concise for review; use appendices for supplemental tables if needed.
- Determine whether to list supplier-specific data versus generic performance ranges; choose the option that best keeps materials flexible for procurement.

## Examples
- OWS data sheet should outline retention volume, separation efficiency, instrumentation, and maintenance access as required artifacts (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Pipe material data sheets may include coating systems, cathodic protection requirements, and jointing details referenced in the Employer's Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
