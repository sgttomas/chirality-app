| Status | INITIALIZED |

## Attributes

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Data Sheet Number | TBD (aligned with Specification documentation control, see Specification.md: Documentation) |
| Revision | 00 |
| Subject | OWS and pipe material data aligned with the Guidance rationale for environmental protection |
| Format | Project data sheet template (TBD) |
| Classification | Performance & materials |

## Conditions

- Establishes the data required to substantiate underground utilities per the Employer's Requirements and PKG-03 scope, including storm drainage, OWS, and duct banks (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:201).
- Supports environmental protection OBJ-7 through defined containment and materials data (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Designed to interface with the Specification (DEL-03.02) and the Drawing Set (DEL-03.01) by translating requirements into tangible data sheet tables.
- Guidance.md: Principles clarify why certain materials or coating systems are prioritized, and Procedure.md ensures the data sheets are reviewed with the same QA checkpoints.

## Construction

- Anticipated artifacts: OWS data sheet, pipe material data sheets, with tables for capacities, materials, corrosion protection, and testing requirements (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Data sheet content references Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 for validation of performance and testing expectations (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Format aligns with the project Quality Management Plan and document control procedures (Volume 2 Part 1) and the Procedure inspection steps capture sign-offs.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Specification: Make sure the Datasheet’s subject, format, and verification pointers mirror the Specification’s requirements so the data table validates each clause (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Guidance: Use the Guidance principles to justify why the Datasheet focuses on certain materials and testing parameters (Guidance.md: Principles, Trade-offs).
- Procedure: Procedure steps describe how the Datasheet’s verification checkpoints are reviewed, so align the documentation log entries accordingly (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
