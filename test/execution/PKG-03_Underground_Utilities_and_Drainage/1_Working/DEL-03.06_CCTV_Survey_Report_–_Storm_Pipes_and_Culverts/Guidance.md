# Guidance: DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report – Storm Pipes & Culverts

## Purpose
- Steer the execution and reporting of CCTV surveys for storm pipes and culverts to verify their condition and compliance with PKG-03 requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203).
- Provide clear remediation recommendations so installation issues affecting OBJ-7 Environmental Protection are resolved promptly (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).

## Principles
- Document each defect with codified severity, location referencing the drawing set, and a recommended next step to maintain traceability.
- Include notation that references the Specification's defect categories so remediation recommendations align with QA expectations (Specification.md: Functional Requirements).
- Align CCTV survey reports with QA/QC expectations from the project Quality Management Plan to ensure acceptance during reviews (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Maintain consistent terminology with the drawings and specifications so that reviewers understand the impacted systems.

## Considerations
- Schedule surveys after bulk earthworks are complete to avoid rework but before final paving when access is still possible.
- When CCTV footage reveals potential contamination risks, flag the issue for environmental control teams and highlight containment actions.
- Follow Procedure.md steps so the footage capture, coding, and remediation recommendation process is consistent with the recorded metadata (Procedure.md: Steps; Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Coordinate defect locations with as-built surveys (DEL-03.05) to confirm the position of the affected pipe or culvert.

## Trade-offs
- Trade between capturing high-resolution footage for accuracy and minimizing data volumes that could slow report delivery.
- Balance speed of survey completion with thorough documentation to avoid missing subtle defects that could impact hydraulic performance.

## Examples
- Include defect coding log entries that specify pipe segment identifiers, defect types, and remediation priority (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Provide a remediation recommendation table that links to remedial drawings or procedures when defects exceed acceptance criteria.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Guidance trade-offs describe how much footage and severity data the Datasheet should capture, keeping the reported coverage consistent (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Guidance principles justify the running commentary behind the Specification’s defect categories and remediation statements (Specification.md: Functional Requirements).
- Procedure: The Procedure steps reference this Guidance so the timing, coding, and reporting are controlled by the same rationale (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
