# Procedure: DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report – Storm Pipes & Culverts

## Purpose
- Define how CCTV surveys of storm pipes and culverts are conducted, analyzed, and reported to support PKG-03 design verification (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm installation progress from DEL-03.01 and instrumentation statuses from DEL-03.02.
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 1 (Quality Management Plan), Volume 2 Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works), and package reference index in `execution/PKG-03_Underground_Utilities_and_Drainage/0_References/_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
- **Equipment:** Certified CCTV survey equipment, defect coding templates, power sources.
- **Personnel:** Specialist surveyor, QA reviewer, data analyst.
- **Guidance inputs:** Use Guidance.md trade-offs to decide how much detail to capture and when to escalate defects, ensuring records remain concise yet actionable.

## Steps
1. Review scope and anticipated artifacts (CCTV report, defect coding log, remediation recommendations) from `_CONTEXT.md` and confirm the pipes/culverts to be surveyed with reference to the Specification's reporting expectations.
2. Prepare a survey plan referencing drawings (DEL-03.01) and the Datasheet metadata to note chainage, invert elevations, and expected structures.
3. Execute the CCTV inspections, recording footage, noting defects, and coding them per the project's defect legend.
4. Analyze findings, categorize severity, and capture remediation recommendations with references to key drawings, data sheets, and the Procedure's guidance paths (Procedure.md: Verification).
5. Compile the report package with footage links, defect tables, and QA sign-offs, then route it through document control for distribution while recording the review status in the Datasheet.

## Verification
- QA review confirms defect coding accuracy and consistency with the drawing references.
- Remediation recommendations are validated for constructability considerations and justified via Guidance trade-offs.
- Sign-off is logged per the Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf) and captured in the Datasheet metadata for future tracking.

## Records
- CCTV survey report, defect coding log, remediation tables, and QA review comments retained for the project archive.
- Include references to drawing numbers, material data, and testing records to aid future troubleshooting.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Procedure verification steps ensure the Datasheet’s reporting and QA metadata reflect completed reviews (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Each Procedure step ties back to the Specification’s requirements so reviewers understand how CCTV feedback satisfies contractual obligations (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Guidance: The Guidance trade-offs inform which defects trigger remediation recommendations and are referenced when the Procedure explains escalation (Guidance.md: Trade-offs).
