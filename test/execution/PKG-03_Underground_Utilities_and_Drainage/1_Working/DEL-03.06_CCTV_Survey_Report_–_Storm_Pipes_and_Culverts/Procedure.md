# Procedure: DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report – Storm Pipes & Culverts

## Purpose

Define the step-by-step process for developing, verifying, and documenting the CCTV Survey Report for PKG-03 storm pipes and culverts, ensuring that defect analysis, pipe condition assessment, and remediation recommendations are completed consistently, reviewed rigorously, and delivered with complete quality documentation (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203).

**Production purpose:** Enable specialist surveyor to analyze DEL-03.05 CCTV inspection records (video files, defect coding logs), assess pipe condition using standard defect coding system (PACP or equivalent), and develop remediation recommendations supporting commissioning acceptance and operations handover.

**QA purpose:** Ensure CCTV survey report undergoes self-check, interdisciplinary coordination check, and independent review per project Quality Management Plan requirements before issue, creating traceable QA record for commissioning acceptance and asset management.

- **Cross-reference:** Datasheet §Construction report sections; Specification §Scope; Guidance §C-3.

### 2. Confirm Survey Extent and Access

- Document any survey limitations (access limitations, flow conditions preventing survey, video quality issues, incomplete chainage coverage).
- Coordinate with DEL-03.05 survey team for any missing information or clarifications on field inspection records.
- **Verification checkpoint:** Specialist surveyor confirms survey extent is complete and any limitations are documented for report introduction.
- **Cross-reference:** Specification §IF-2 coordination with DEL-03.05; Datasheet §References DEL-03.05 coordination; Guidance §C-1 survey timing and access coordination.

- Obtain DEL-03.04 Data Sheet Package for pipe material data sheets; document data sheet package revision (Specification §IF-1).

**3.2 Extract ER CCTV Survey Requirements and Defect Severity Criteria:**
- Extract applicable CCTV survey procedures and defect severity criteria from Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2; document ER clause references (Specification §Standards; Guidance §C-2 ER compliance and defect severity criteria consideration).
- Review project CCTV survey standards (PACP or equivalent) for defect coding system and severity scoring criteria; document standard edition and applicable sections.

**3.3 Collect DEL-03.05 CCTV Inspection Records:**

**Verification checkpoint:** Discipline checker reviews input data completeness and data source documentation; confirms coordination with related deliverables.

**Cross-reference:** Specification §IF-1, §IF-2, §QR-2 implied; Guidance §C-1, §C-2; Datasheet §Attributes "Data Sources".

### 4. Execute Defect Analysis

**4.1 Review CCTV Video Files and Validate Field Inspection Records:**
- Review all CCTV video files systematically by pipe section; validate defect coding logs from DEL-03.05 field inspection against video evidence.
- Identify any defects missed during field inspection; add to defect coding log.
- Verify defect location referencing accuracy (chainage measurements, manhole references) by comparing to video timestamps and landmarks.
- Verify defect photographs accurately represent defects in video; capture additional video frame captures for significant defects if needed.

**4.2 Execute Defect Coding and Severity Assessment:**
- Code all defects using standard CCTV survey defect coding system (PACP or equivalent per project CCTV survey standards) with defect type codes (crack, fracture, joint offset, joint separation, deformation, root intrusion, debris/sediment, corrosion, surface damage).
- Assess defect severity using PACP (or equivalent) severity scoring criteria considering defect dimensions, structural impact (pipe strength reduction, collapse risk), hydraulic impact (flow reduction, blockage risk, infiltration/exfiltration potential), defect frequency (isolated, widespread), and progression risk (stable, active, deteriorating).
- Document defect descriptions with dimensions, orientation, condition details; measure defect dimensions from video using camera measurement tools or calibration references.
- Organize defect coding log in tabulated format per Guidance §Example 2 (pipe ID, chainage, location reference, defect type with PACP code, severity, defect description, environmental impact flag, hydraulic impact assessment, photograph reference, remediation recommendation reference).

**4.3 Assess Environmental and Hydraulic Impacts:**
- **Environmental impact assessment**: Review defects for environmental impact (defects in pipes within containment areas, defects creating potential spill migration pathways, defects near sensitive receptors); flag environmental defects in defect coding log with "Yes" in environmental impact column; assess environmental consequences (containment breach risk, spill volume, migration pathway, receptor sensitivity); coordinate with environmental specialist for critical environmental defects (Guidance §P-2 environmental protection defect identification; Guidance §C-6 environmental defect assessment).
- **Hydraulic impact assessment**: Review defects for hydraulic impact (flow reduction from deformation or debris, blockage risk from root intrusion or sediment, infiltration/exfiltration from cracks or joint defects); compare defect flow impacts to design flow rates and capacity margins from DEL-03.03 calculations; document hydraulic impact in defect coding log (minor, moderate, severe impact on flow capacity).

**4.4 Assess Overall Pipe Condition:**
- Assign overall condition rating to each surveyed pipe based on defect frequency, defect severity, and cumulative impact using pipe condition rating system (good/fair/poor or numerical rating per PACP or equivalent system or project-specific criteria).
- **Good condition**: Minimal defects (minor defects only, isolated frequency), design life expectancy expected, routine monitoring recommended.
- **Fair condition**: Moderate defects (moderate severity defects, scattered frequency), design life may be reduced, enhanced monitoring or near-term remediation recommended.
- **Poor condition**: Significant defects (severe or critical defects, frequent or widespread), design life uncertain, remediation required before commissioning or near-term.
- Document overall condition rating in pipe inventory.

**Verification checkpoint:** Self-check verifies defect coding system is correctly applied, severity assessment is consistent, environmental/hydraulic impact assessments are complete, overall pipe condition ratings are justified.
