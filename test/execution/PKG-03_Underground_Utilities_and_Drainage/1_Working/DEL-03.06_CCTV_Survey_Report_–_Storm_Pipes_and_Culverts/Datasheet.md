## Conditions

**Context & environmental expectations:**
- Documents analysis and results for CCTV survey of storm pipes and culverts within PKG-03, providing detailed defect assessment, pipe condition evaluation, and remediation recommendations required for design verification, commissioning acceptance, and operations handover (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203; Specification §Scope provides detailed report coverage).
- Designed to support storm drainage system condition assessment within Fraser Surrey Terminal facility boundaries per Scope Focus (Contractor scope only, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47; Specification §Scope exclusions clarifies what is NOT in report scope).
- Deliverable supports **OBJ-7 Environmental Protection**; CCTV survey report must identify defects that could impact containment integrity, environmental controls, or spill migration pathways to support environmental protection system adequacy (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; elaborated in Guidance §P-2 environmental protection defect identification principle; implemented via Procedure §4.3 environmental impact assessment; verified via Specification §FR-2 requirement and Procedure §8.3.3 independent check).
- Defect severity criteria, pipe condition assessment methods, and remediation prioritization are defined in CCTV survey standards (PACP or equivalent), Employer's Requirements, and engineering judgment; report provides objective pipe condition assessment supporting asset management and maintenance planning (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; see Specification §PR-1 defect severity and condition assessment requirement; Procedure §Prerequisites lists CCTV survey standards as required references; Guidance §C-2 addresses ER compliance and defect severity criteria consideration).
- Coordinate report metadata, revision process, and content organization with the Specification §FR-5 and §Documentation requirements to ensure report control aligns with project document management procedures and Quality Management Plan (cross-reference: Specification §FR-5 report metadata and traceability requirement implemented via Procedure §7 metadata compilation and §9 issue into document control).

**Operational context:**
- CCTV survey report is used by QA/QC inspectors for pipe condition verification, by project management for remediation planning and scheduling, by commissioning teams for system acceptance, by operations teams for asset condition baseline and maintenance planning (see Procedure §Verification and §8 for review workflow), and by future maintenance teams for defect monitoring and repair prioritization (ASSUMPTION per typical CCTV survey report lifecycle; Guidance §C-7 operations handover and maintenance reference consideration explains balancing defect analysis detail with report usability).
- Environmental protection defect identification (defects affecting containment, defects creating potential spill migration pathways, defects near sensitive receptors) is critical for OBJ-7 compliance and regulatory inspections; report clarity and completeness directly affect remediation acceptance and environmental risk assessment (rationale in Guidance §P-2 environmental protection defect identification principle; Procedure §4.3 environmental impact assessment implements clear identification).

## Construction

**Report sections & content focus:**
- Primary sections documented in the report include:
  - **Executive summary**: Survey overview (survey date, survey crew, survey extent, survey methodology reference), key findings (number of pipes surveyed, total length surveyed, number of defects identified by severity, critical defects requiring immediate attention), overall pipe condition assessment (percentage of pipes in good/fair/poor condition, condition rating system explanation), recommendations summary (high-priority remediation actions, monitoring recommendations, follow-up survey requirements) (Specification §Scope lists "executive summary"; Procedure §5.1 describes executive summary development; Guidance §P-1 emphasizes clear summary for stakeholder communication; Guidance §Example 1 provides executive summary structure guidance).
  - **Pipe inventory**: Tabulated list of all surveyed pipes with pipe identification (pipe ID from DEL-03.01 drawings, pipe material type from DEL-03.04 data sheets, pipe diameter, pipe length), location referencing (upstream manhole, downstream manhole, chainage limits), survey status (surveyed date, surveyor name, video file reference), overall condition rating (good/fair/poor or numerical rating per PACP or equivalent system) (cross-reference: DEL-03.01 Drawing Set for pipe identification and layout per Specification §IF-1; Procedure §5.2 describes pipe inventory compilation; Guidance §C-4 pipe inventory organization consideration).
  - **Defect analysis**: Comprehensive defect coding log in tabulated format with columns: pipe ID (reference to DEL-03.01 drawing), chainage (distance from upstream manhole), location reference (manholes, tie-in points, landmarks), defect type (crack, fracture, joint offset, joint separation, deformation, root intrusion, debris/sediment, corrosion, surface damage per PACP or equivalent coding), defect severity (minor, moderate, severe, critical per PACP scoring or project-specific criteria), defect description (dimensions, orientation, condition details), environmental impact flag (yes/no for defects affecting containment or creating spill migration risk per OBJ-7), hydraulic impact assessment (flow reduction, blockage risk, infiltration/exfiltration potential), photograph/video frame capture reference, remediation recommendation reference (cross-reference: DEL-03.05 CCTV Inspection Records provides raw defect data per Specification §IF-2; DEL-03.02 Technical Specification for defect severity criteria; Procedure §4 describes defect analysis execution; Guidance §P-3 defect coding and severity assessment principle; Guidance §Example 2 provides defect analysis table structure).
  - **Remediation recommendations**: Defect-by-defect remediation recommendations in tabulated format with columns: defect reference (pipe ID + chainage), defect severity, recommended action (monitor, repair, replace, clean, line), remediation method (pipe repair methods, lining options, replacement approach), priority (immediate, near-term, long-term, monitor per Guidance §T-2 remediation priority trade-off), estimated cost implications (order of magnitude cost estimate for budgeting), implementation timing (coordinate with construction schedule, operations access windows), supporting notes (rationale for recommended action, alternative methods considered, coordination with other work) (Specification §Scope lists "remediation recommendations"; Procedure §5.4 describes remediation recommendations development; Guidance §P-4 remediation recommendation development principle emphasizes constructability and cost-effectiveness; Guidance §Example 3 provides remediation recommendations table structure).
  - **Defect photographs and video frame captures**: High-resolution images of significant defects with annotations (defect type, severity, orientation, measurement references), organized by pipe ID and chainage for easy cross-reference to defect analysis tables (Procedure §5.3 describes defect photograph/video frame capture compilation; Guidance §C-5 defect documentation detail consideration discusses image quality and annotation standards).
  - **Video file index**: Tabulated list of all CCTV video files with columns: video file name, pipe ID covered, chainage coverage (start chainage, end chainage), inspection date, video file format, video file storage location (digital media reference, cloud storage link, physical media reference), video quality notes (lighting, clarity, camera issues) (Procedure §5.5 describes video file index compilation; supports traceability to raw inspection data per Specification §QR-3).
  - **Conclusions and sign-offs**: Overall pipe condition conclusions (system-level condition assessment, design life expectancy, maintenance planning recommendations), limitations and assumptions (access limitations, survey coverage exclusions, video quality issues affecting defect detection), reviewer sign-offs (specialist surveyor signature/date, QA/QC reviewer signature/date, approver signature/date), distribution list (Specification §Scope lists "conclusions and sign-offs"; Procedure §6 describes conclusions development and sign-off acquisition; Guidance §C-6 report limitations and assumptions consideration).
- Report content is sourced from DEL-03.05 CCTV inspection records (raw video, defect coding logs), analyzed using CCTV survey standards (PACP or equivalent defect coding and severity criteria), validated against design deliverables (DEL-03.01 drawings, DEL-03.02 specification, DEL-03.03 calculations), and compiled into comprehensive report to support remediation planning, commissioning acceptance, and operations handover (ASSUMPTION per typical CCTV survey report purpose; see Specification §Scope report substantiation purpose and §IF-1 linkage to related deliverables; Procedure §3 describes collecting input data from multiple sources).
- Defect severity assessment criteria (defect dimensions, structural impact, hydraulic impact, environmental impact, frequency, progression risk) are documented in report to support remediation prioritization and cost-benefit analysis (Specification §PR-1 defect severity and condition assessment requirement; Procedure §4.2 describes defect severity assessment execution; Guidance §C-2 defect severity criteria consideration).
