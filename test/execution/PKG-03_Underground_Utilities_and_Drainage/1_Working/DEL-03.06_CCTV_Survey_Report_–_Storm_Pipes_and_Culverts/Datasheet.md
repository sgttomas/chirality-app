| Package | PKG-03 Underground Utilities & Drainage |
| Discipline | Civil |
| Type | Report |
| Responsible | D&B Contractor (Specialist Surveyor) |
| Status | INITIALIZED |

## Attributes

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Report Number | TBD (recorded per Specification documentation rules) |
| Revision | 00 |
| Survey Coverage | Storm pipes and culverts on site |
| Format | Digital/video logs with defect coding |

## Conditions

- Documents CCTV survey results for storm pipes and culverts required for design verification (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203).
- Supports compliance with OBJ-7 Environmental Protection by reporting defects that could impact containment (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Provides remediation recommendations that feed into DEL-03.05 (Installation & Test Records) and may trigger drawing updates; see Guidance.md: Trade-offs for when to issue remediation recommendations.

## Construction

- Anticipated artifacts include a CCTV survey report, defect coding log, and remediation recommendations (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Format should include summary pages, key findings, defect tables, and annotated photo/video references that align with the Specification's reporting expectations (Specification.md: Performance Requirements).
- Aligns with QA/QC recording expectations in Volume 2 Part 1 of the Employer’s Requirements, and the Procedure ensures verification checkpoints (Procedure.md: Verification) are completed before release.
