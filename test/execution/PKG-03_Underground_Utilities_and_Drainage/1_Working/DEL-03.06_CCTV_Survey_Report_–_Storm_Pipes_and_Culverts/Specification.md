# Specification: DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report – Storm Pipes & Culverts

## Scope
Documents the analysis and outcomes of CCTV surveys for storm pipes and culverts within PKG-03, supporting design verification and approvals (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Capture CCTV footage and annotated logs for each surveyed storm pipe and culvert, including location, condition, and defect coding details (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Provide remediation recommendations and prioritize defects that may impact containment or hydraulic performance, referencing OBJ-7 responsibilities (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Ensure the documented defects and recommendations align with the Datasheet metadata so the report can be cross-referenced by QA reviewers (Datasheet.md: Conditions).

### Performance Requirements
- CCTV surveys must be conducted per the Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 inspection expectations and produce a deliverable that can be reviewed for compliance.
- Reports should clearly state the acceptance criteria, defect categories, and severity levels used during the survey process.

### Interface Requirements
- Coordinate CCTV report references with DEL-03.01 drawings and DEL-03.05 records so that defects align with drawing numbers and field test evidence.
- Feed remediation recommendations into the installation and test records, ensuring follow-up actions are tracked (see DEL-03.05).
- Refer to Procedure.md steps to confirm the sequencing of surveys and the formality of remediation recommendations, especially where data indicates urgent containment issues.

### Quality Requirements
- Report formats must include reviewer initials, dates, and QA/QC checkboxes consistent with Volume 2 Part 1 Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Preserve raw footage and annotated logs as part of the record package.

## Standards
- Follow inspection and reporting guidance provided in Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 for stormwater and culvert systems (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Document control and QA expectations from Volume 2 Part 1 apply to this report.

## Verification
- Independent review of CCTV logs verifies defect coding, location accuracy, and clarity of remediation actions.
- QA sign-off confirms that the report includes referenced footage or still images where defects are noted.
- Incorporate Guidance.md trade-offs to justify the depth of footage review and to document why certain defects require remediation versus monitoring.

## Documentation
- Deliverables include the CCTV survey report, defect coding log, and remediation recommendations listed in `_CONTEXT.md` (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:203).
- Archive the report and supporting files within the document control system for future gating and compliance reviews.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Specification’s requirements dictate the Datasheet’s coverage fields so they capture the same defect/log expectations (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Guidance: The Explanation of remediation recommendations connects the Guidance principles to the Specification’s severity and reporting clauses (Guidance.md: Principles).
- Procedure: Procedure steps show how these Specification requirements are verified, linking the remediations to actual review actions (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
