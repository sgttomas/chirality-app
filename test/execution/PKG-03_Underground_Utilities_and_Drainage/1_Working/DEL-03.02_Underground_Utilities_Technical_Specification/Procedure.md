# Procedure: DEL-03.02 Underground Utilities Technical Specification

## Purpose
- Establish the process for drafting, reviewing, and controlling the technical specification that governs underground utilities performance, materials, and workmanship in PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199). 

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm inputs from DEL-03.03 (Design Calculations) and DEL-03.01 (Drawing Set) before beginning, since the specification references both deliverables.
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 1 (General Requirements) and Volume 2 Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works), package reference index (`execution/PKG-03_Underground_Utilities_and_Drainage/0_References/_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`).
- **Data inputs:** Hydraulic model results, material selection recommendations, and schedule data for installations.
- **Personnel:** Civil specifier, QA/QC reviewer, and document control support (ASSUMPTION: per QA/QC plan in Volume 2 Part 1).

## Steps
1. Confirm scope statements from the decomposition and `_CONTEXT.md`, ensuring coverage of storm drainage, OWS, and duct bank requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).
2. Gather design criteria from DEL-03.03 Design Calculations and relevant Employer's Requirements clauses; cross-check these criteria with the Guidance document to capture the intended principles (Guidance.md: Principles).
3. Draft specification sections for materials, workmanship, inspection, and testing, aligning each section with applicable codes, the Datasheet attributes, and project objectives.
4. Validate coordination points with adjacent packages (paving, earthworks) to avoid conflicting requirements.
5. Run internal QA/QC review (self-check, checker review) and record outcomes in the project document register; reflect these outcomes in the Datasheet revision metadata and the Drawing Set verification steps (Datasheet.md: Attributes; DEL-03.01 Procedure: Verification).
6. Release the specification through document control with revision history and approvals before handing over to implementation teams and referencing the Procedure for future updates.

## Verification
- Conduct specification peer review and QA checks per the project Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Cross-check each requirement with the verification method listed in the Specification document to guarantee traceability.
- Maintain linkage to the Datasheet and Drawing Set so reviewers can trace requirements back to deliverable artifacts.

## Records
- Formal specification document, review minutes, QA checklists, and final approval logs retained in the document control system.
- Reference and supporting calculations referenced in DEL-03.03 are documented alongside the specification for future revisions.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Procedure verification steps close the loop on the metadata and attributes listed in the Datasheet, so approvals correlate with the referenced document control fields (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Each Procedure step links directly to the requirement it validates in the Specification to guarantee traceability (Specification.md: Verification).
- Guidance: The Guidance rationale for inspections feeds into Procedure to demonstrate why the steps exist and what outcomes (environmental protection focus) they aim to produce (Guidance.md: Principles, Considerations).
