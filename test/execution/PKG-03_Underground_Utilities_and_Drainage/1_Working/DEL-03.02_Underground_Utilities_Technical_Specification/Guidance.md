# Guidance: DEL-03.02 Underground Utilities Technical Specification

## Purpose
- Guide the creation of the specification that captures performance, materials, and workmanship for the underground utilities scope in PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).
- Help ensure the specification supports the environmental protection objective for the package by explicitly documenting containment and inspection protocols (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).

## Principles
- Structure the specification so each requirement directly references mandate(s) from the Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2, enabling easy traceability during QA/QC reviews (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Emphasize clarity in the workmanship and inspection requirements, since downstream record deliverables (DEL-03.05) depend on the inspection protocols defined here.
- Keep terminology consistent with the datasheet and drawing deliverables to avoid confusion across contracting packages (Datasheet.md: Conditions; DEL-03.01 Specification: Interface Requirements).

## Considerations
- Confirm hydraulic inputs and design parameters from DEL-03.03 (Design Calculations) before finalizing performance requirements (ASSUMPTION: design calculations inform the specification).
- Use the anticipated artifacts list (storm drainage, OWS, duct bank specifications) to drive section organization and deliverable structure (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Reference the decomposition's Scope Focus to avoid inadvertently specifying Employer-only items (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- Coordinate with QA/QC teams to align inspection frequencies with record keeping expectations in DEL-03.05 and with review checkpoints enumerated in Procedure.md: Steps.
 
## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Guidance trade-offs provide context for why the Datasheet captures certain attributes (project numbering, revision control) and ensure the same coverage across documents (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Guidance principles justify the inclusion/exclusion of requirements in the Specification and help to clarify the inspection logic (Specification.md: Functional Requirements, Quality Requirements).
- Procedure: Procedure verification steps rely on the Guidance's priorities to confirm requirements before issuing; use this section to justify why each step is necessary (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).

## Trade-offs
- Balance specification granularity with design schedule: producing highly detailed material submittals may slow issuance, but too little detail risks rework during installation.
- Prioritize environmental protection requirements (e.g., containment water capture) while ensuring the specification remains buildable within site constraints.
- Weigh standardization (template sections) against the need for unique requirements for OWS and duct bank systems to avoid conflating distinct systems.

## Examples
- Reference the storm drainage, OWS, and duct bank specifications listed in `_CONTEXT.md` to define major sections for the document.
- Use sample inspection tables from existing project Quality Management Plan templates to ensure compliance with Volume 2 Part 1 (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
