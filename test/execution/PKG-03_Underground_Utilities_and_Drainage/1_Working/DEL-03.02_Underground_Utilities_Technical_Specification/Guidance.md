# Guidance: DEL-03.02 Underground Utilities Technical Specification

## Purpose

**Primary Purpose:**
- Support the development of underground utilities technical specification that establishes performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for PKG-03 storm drainage, oil-water separator (OWS), duct banks, and trenchless crossing infrastructure (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).
- Provide interpretive guidance that complements the Specification requirements and Procedure workflow by clarifying how specification language ties to performance outcomes, environmental protection objectives, and construction execution (Specification §Scope defines what specification contains; this Guidance explains why and how).

**Secondary Purpose:**
- Help specification writers make informed decisions about performance vs. prescriptive requirements, material selection criteria, testing protocols, and trade-offs during specification development (supports Procedure §Steps workflow where writers refine requirements into specification sections).
- Clarify the intent behind Specification requirements (especially FR-2 environmental protection performance, IF-1 coordination with related deliverables, and QR-3 testing/inspection requirements) so reviewers can assess whether specification meets project objectives beyond mere compliance checking.
- Provide context for material suppliers, construction contractors, and QA/QC personnel who will use this specification for submittal preparation, installation execution, and inspection verification (Datasheet §Conditions operational context describes downstream users).

## Principles

**P-1: Hydraulic Performance and Durability**
- The storm drainage and OWS systems specified in this document must demonstrate clear performance criteria for hydraulic capacity, structural durability, and service life that satisfy the Employer's Requirements for civil utilities and environmental protection (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf; Specification §PR-1 sets hydraulic and structural performance expectations).
- **Rationale**: Specification material requirements must enable performance compliance documented in design calculations (DEL-03.03). Specifying materials without clear performance linkage (e.g., "450mm HDPE pipe" without ring stiffness, jointing method, or bedding requirements) leaves gaps that cause submittal delays, material rejections, or installation failures. Performance criteria (hydraulic capacity, structural loading, durability) provide the basis for material selection and installation requirements.
- **Application**: When drafting storm drainage specification sections, include:
  - Performance basis: Design storm event, design life, structural loading conditions (from DEL-03.03 Design Calculations and civil design brief per Specification §PR-1 and §PR-3)
  - Material performance requirements: Pipe ring stiffness or crushing strength, chemical resistance, jointing method performance (watertightness, flexibility), bedding and backfill requirements to achieve performance
  - Installation requirements: Alignment tolerances, slope requirements, jointing procedures, backfill lift thickness and compaction to ensure installed system meets performance criteria
  - Testing requirements: Hydrostatic pressure testing or air testing to verify watertightness, CCTV inspection to verify installation quality (supports DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report per Specification §IF-1)
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §PR-1 hydraulic and structural performance; Specification §PR-3 design life and environmental conditions; Datasheet §Construction storm drainage specification content; Procedure §Steps storm drainage requirements development.

**P-2: Environmental Protection Performance (OBJ-7)**
- This deliverable supports **OBJ-7 Environmental Protection**; specification must clearly capture OWS treatment performance criteria, discharge limits, and monitoring protocols to demonstrate compliance with environmental protection requirements and facilitate regulatory permitting (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; Specification §FR-2 environmental protection performance requirement).
- **Rationale**: Environmental protection performance (OWS oil removal efficiency, discharge quality limits, monitoring instrumentation) is critical for:
  - Regulatory permitting: Environmental permit conditions will specify discharge limits (oil content ppm, suspended solids mg/L, pH range); specification must define OWS performance that meets or exceeds permit limits.
  - Material supplier selection: OWS equipment suppliers need clear performance criteria (treatment flow rate, removal efficiency, retention time) to propose compliant equipment; vague or incomplete performance criteria cause submittal delays or non-compliant equipment selections.
  - Performance testing and commissioning: Specification performance criteria provide acceptance standards for commissioning tests documented in DEL-03.05 Installation and Test Records; clear criteria enable objective pass/fail determination.
(Datasheet §Conditions operational context describes these downstream uses; Specification §FR-2 and §PR-2 require clear environmental protection performance criteria.)
- **Application**: When drafting OWS specification section, emphasize:
  - Treatment performance criteria: Oil removal efficiency (percentage or outlet concentration), solids settling capacity, treatment flow rate capacity (L/s or m³/h from DEL-03.03 Design Calculations per Specification §PR-2)
  - Discharge limits: Maximum allowable concentrations for oil, suspended solids, pH, other parameters (from environmental permit conditions or Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2)
  - Instrumentation and monitoring: Level sensors, flow meters, oil content monitors, alarm setpoints, data logging requirements (coordinate with PKG-18 Instrumentation if applicable)
  - Materials of construction: Chemical resistance to canola oil, stormwater constituents, cleaning chemicals; structural integrity for burial and traffic loads; corrosion resistance for design life
  - Performance testing protocol: Pre-commissioning inspection, flow rate verification testing, oil removal efficiency testing (sample collection, laboratory analysis, acceptance criteria), discharge quality verification (supports DEL-03.05 performance test records per Specification §IF-1)
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §FR-2 environmental protection performance; Specification §PR-2 OWS treatment capacity and containment performance; Datasheet §Conditions OBJ-7 environmental protection emphasis; Procedure §Steps environmental protection requirements definition.

**P-3: Material and Workmanship Clarity**
- Maintain clear, unambiguous material specifications and workmanship requirements (material standards, installation tolerances, testing protocols, acceptance criteria) so material suppliers can prepare compliant submittals and construction contractors can execute installations correctly without excessive RFIs or clarifications (Specification §QR-1 submittal requirements; Datasheet §Attributes applicable standards).
- **Rationale**: Clear material and workmanship specifications are essential for:
  - Material submittals: Suppliers need clear material standards (CSA, ASTM, or other standards with specific requirements) to identify compliant products and prepare submittals; ambiguous specifications (e.g., "PVC pipe suitable for storm drainage") cause submittal delays while suppliers seek clarification.
  - Construction execution: Contractors need clear installation requirements (bedding thickness, backfill lift thickness, compaction density, jointing procedures, alignment tolerances) to execute work correctly; vague requirements cause field interpretation variations, RFIs, and rework risk.
  - QA/QC verification: Inspectors need clear acceptance criteria (numerical tolerances, test methods, pass/fail standards) to verify compliance objectively; subjective criteria (e.g., "satisfactory workmanship") cause inspection disputes and acceptance delays.
(Specification §QR-2 emphasizes specification clarity for review and approval process; Procedure §Verification independent check confirms specification clarity and completeness.)
- **Application**: In all specification sections:
  - Reference specific material standards: "Pipe shall be HDPE conforming to CSA B137.1 DR 13.5" rather than "HDPE pipe suitable for storm drainage"
  - Define clear installation requirements: "Backfill shall be placed in 300mm lifts and compacted to 95% Standard Proctor density (ASTM D698)" rather than "backfill shall be properly compacted"
  - Specify objective acceptance criteria: "Hydrostatic pressure test at 1.5 × design pressure for 2 hours with leakage not exceeding 50 mL per 100 joints per hour (per ASTM F1417)" rather than "pressure test to verify watertightness"
  - Include references to related documents: "See DEL-03.01 Drawing Set Sheet C-03 for pipe alignment and invert elevations" to provide context without duplicating drawing information
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §QR-1 submittal requirements; Specification §QR-2 specification review and approval; Specification §Standards governing and supplementary standards; Guidance §C-5 construction use and material flexibility.

**P-4: Coordination with Installation Records**
- Prioritize coordination between specification testing/inspection requirements and installation records deliverable (DEL-03.05) because specification defines what testing is required and installation records document that testing was performed per requirements (Specification §IF-1 coordination with related deliverables; Specification §QR-3 testing and inspection requirements).
- **Rationale**: Specification and installation records have interdependent relationship:
  - Specification defines testing requirements: Test methods, test frequencies, acceptance criteria, documentation requirements (what data to record, what forms to use, what approvals are needed).
  - Installation records document testing results: Test data, observations, pass/fail determinations, corrective actions for failed tests, final acceptance sign-offs.
  - Misalignment causes QA failures: If specification requires testing that installation records don't document (or vice versa), QA verification is incomplete and contract acceptance is delayed.
(Specification §IF-1 lists DEL-03.05 as related deliverable requiring coordination; Guidance §C-4 QA coordination consideration emphasizes traceability for QA sign-offs.)
- **Application**: When developing specification testing and inspection requirements:
  - Coordinate testing requirements with installation records structure: If DEL-03.05 has separate sections for hydrostatic testing, CCTV inspection, OWS performance testing, ensure specification has corresponding testing requirement sections with same test names and acceptance criteria.
  - Define clear documentation requirements: "Hydrostatic test results shall be recorded on form [TBD] and submitted to Engineer for review within 48 hours of test completion; test records shall be included in DEL-03.05 Installation and Test Records."
  - Reference installation records in specification: "Testing and inspection procedures and results documentation per DEL-03.05 Installation and Test Records requirements."
  - Include testing frequency and timing: "CCTV inspection shall be performed after backfilling is complete but before pavement restoration; inspection results per DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report."
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §IF-1 coordination with DEL-03.05 Installation and Test Records; Specification §QR-3 testing and inspection requirements; Datasheet §Construction testing requirements; Procedure §Steps testing requirements development; Procedure §Verification interdisciplinary check includes DEL-03.05 coordination review.

## Considerations

**C-1: Design Calculation Availability**
- Confirm design calculations (DEL-03.03) are complete and approved before finalizing specification performance requirements (hydraulic capacity, structural loading, OWS treatment capacity) to ensure specification material requirements support calculated performance (Scope focus: contractor-only work, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47; Specification §IF-1 coordination with DEL-03.03; Procedure §Prerequisites and §Steps input data collection).
- **Impact**: If design calculations are not available or change after specification is issued, specification material requirements may not support actual performance needs, causing specification revisions, material resubmittals, or installation rework.
- **Mitigation**: Use placeholder performance criteria ("TBD – refer to DEL-03.03 Design Calculations") and issue specification for review/coordination before committing to final performance values; incorporate calculation results and review comments before finalizing (Procedure §Verification interdisciplinary check includes review of calculation alignment).

**C-2: Employer's Requirements Extraction**
- Incorporate material standards, performance criteria, installation methods, and environmental protection requirements captured in Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works), particularly those affecting storm drainage materials, OWS discharge limits, duct bank construction, and trenchless crossing methods (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf; Specification §Standards governing standards; Specification §PR-1, §PR-2, §PR-3 reference ER requirements).
- **Impact**: Specification general requirements section must reference correct ER clauses to satisfy contract requirements and support QA/QC verification (Procedure §Verification independent check confirms compliance with ER).
- **Mitigation**: Extract relevant ER clauses early in specification development (Procedure §Prerequisites lists ER as required reference material); compile list of applicable clauses, standards, and code sections for specification general requirements section; include "Materials and installation per Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2, Section X.X" in specification sections; coordinate with contract administrator to confirm ER interpretation if ambiguous.

**C-3: Section Structure and Scope Boundaries**
- Structure specification sections to clearly identify the anticipated sections listed in Datasheet §Construction and `_CONTEXT.md` (storm drainage, OWS, duct banks, trenchless crossings, general requirements, backfill/restoration) to avoid scope creep, ensure Procedure verification steps capture each section, and maintain traceability to decomposition scope (Specification §Scope anticipated sections; Datasheet §Construction specification organization; Procedure §Verification self-check confirms all anticipated sections present).
- **Impact**: If specification expands beyond anticipated sections (e.g., adding above-ground structures, buildings, process equipment specifications) without scope clarification, QA/QC review scope becomes unclear and deliverable acceptance criteria become ambiguous.
- **Mitigation**: Use specification table of contents to explicitly list sections and their correspondence to anticipated sections; include scope boundary statements (e.g., "Above-ground structures and process equipment specifications are outside PKG-03 scope; see PKG-XX for those specifications"); confirm scope with discipline lead before adding non-standard sections.

**C-4: QA Coordination and Sign-offs**
- Highlight the designated responsible party (D&B Contractor per Datasheet §Identification) and the need for QA/QC sign-offs (self-check, interdisciplinary check, independent check per Specification §QR-1 and §QR-2) to support future installation and test records (DEL-03.05) and maintain contract accountability (Procedure §Verification describes review workflow; Specification §Verification details review activities).
- **Impact**: Missing or incomplete QA/QC sign-offs delay specification issue, block material submittal review and procurement, and create audit trail gaps for contract compliance verification.
- **Mitigation**: Confirm project QA procedures early (Procedure §Prerequisites lists Quality Management Plan as required reference); establish clear originator/checker/approver roles with names and signature authority; track review status via issue register (Specification §Documentation associated quality records); coordinate specification submittal requirements section with project submittal procedures to align specification and QA expectations.

**C-5: Construction Use and Material Flexibility**
- Specification requirements must balance material clarity (clear standards, clear acceptance criteria) with contractor means-and-methods flexibility (allow multiple compliant material options, avoid over-specifying installation procedures that limit contractor execution flexibility) – see Datasheet §Conditions operational context for downstream users (material suppliers, construction contractors; Specification §FR-1 requires sufficient detail for material suppliers and contractors).
- **Impact**: Over-prescriptive specifications (single-source material specifications, overly detailed installation procedures that specify contractor equipment or sequencing) limit competition, increase costs, and may prevent contractors from using preferred materials or methods that are compliant but different from specified approach. Under-prescriptive specifications (vague material descriptions, missing performance criteria, incomplete testing requirements) cause submittal delays, field clarifications, and quality disputes.
- **Mitigation**: Use performance-based specifications where possible: specify performance requirements (hydraulic capacity, structural loading, durability, chemical resistance) and allow contractors to propose materials and methods that meet performance; reference industry standards (CSA, ASTM) to define material requirements rather than specifying single manufacturers; allow "or equal" provisions for manufactured items (OWS equipment, manholes, pull boxes) with clear equivalency criteria; avoid specifying contractor means-and-methods (excavation equipment, installation sequencing, temporary works) unless required for safety or coordination; include general statement: "Contractor may propose alternative materials or methods meeting performance requirements for Engineer review and approval."

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Performance-Based vs. Prescriptive Specifications**
- **Trade-off**: Balance performance-based specifications (specify performance requirements, allow contractor to select materials/methods) with prescriptive specifications (specify exact materials, installation procedures, testing methods).
- **Competing Concerns**:
  - **Performance-based**: Encourages innovation, allows contractors to use preferred materials/methods that meet performance, increases competition and may reduce costs; but requires clear performance criteria definition, robust submittal review process, and performance testing to verify compliance.
  - **Prescriptive**: Provides certainty (everyone knows exactly what materials and methods are required), simplifies submittal review (compliance is yes/no based on specified product), reduces performance risk; but limits contractor flexibility, may increase costs if specified materials are sole-source or difficult to obtain, may prevent use of newer/better products.
- **Decision Guidance**:
  - Use performance-based approach for commodity items where multiple compliant products exist and performance criteria are well-established: Pipe materials (specify performance class per CSA or ASTM standard, allow contractors to select specific pipe meeting standard), bedding and backfill (specify material gradation and compaction requirements, allow contractors to source local materials meeting spec).
  - Use prescriptive approach for critical or specialized items where performance is difficult to verify or where project-specific requirements are unique: OWS equipment (specify performance criteria but may need to pre-approve limited number of manufacturers who can meet unique treatment requirements), instrumentation (specify exact models if integration with existing control systems is required).
  - Hybrid approach often appropriate: Specify performance requirements PLUS acceptable materials/methods (e.g., "Pipe shall be HDPE per CSA B137 OR PVC per CSA B137.2 OR concrete per CSA A257, all meeting Class 150D ring stiffness requirements").
- **Status**: Recommend hybrid performance + prescriptive approach (ASSUMPTION: balance performance flexibility with material certainty); specification sections define performance requirements and list acceptable materials meeting performance; "or equal" provisions allow contractor alternative proposals with justification.
- **Cross-reference**: Datasheet §Conditions operational context (material suppliers, contractors); Specification §FR-1 comprehensive performance and materials requirements; P-3 material and workmanship clarity; C-5 construction use and material flexibility.

**T-2: OWS Treatment Technology Selection**
- **Trade-off**: Choose between specifying OWS treatment technology type (gravity separator, coalescing plate separator, membrane separator, other technologies) vs. specifying performance requirements only and allowing equipment suppliers to propose technology.
- **Competing Concerns**:
  - **Specify technology**: Provides certainty that proven technology will be used, simplifies submittal review (technology is pre-determined), may align with facility owner's operations and maintenance preferences; but limits innovation, may exclude newer/better technologies, may increase cost if specified technology is sole-source.
  - **Performance-only**: Allows equipment suppliers to propose best technology for application, encourages competition and cost optimization, enables use of newer technologies; but requires robust performance criteria definition, more detailed submittal review to evaluate proposed technology, performance testing to verify compliance, operations team may need training on unfamiliar technology.
- **Decision Guidance**:
  - Define clear performance criteria first: Treatment flow rate (L/s), oil removal efficiency (percentage or outlet concentration ppm), solids settling capacity, retention time, footprint constraints, maintenance access requirements (from DEL-03.03 Design Calculations and Employer's Requirements per Specification §PR-2).
  - Consider site-specific factors: Available space (footprint and depth constraints), groundwater elevation (below-grade vs. above-grade installation), electrical power availability (passive gravity separator vs. powered separator), operations staff capabilities (simple gravity separator may be preferred if operations staff has limited technical training).
  - Evaluate technology options against performance and site constraints: Gravity separators (large footprint, simple operation, proven technology), coalescing plate separators (smaller footprint, higher efficiency, more maintenance), membrane or cartridge separators (smallest footprint, highest efficiency, highest maintenance and operating cost).
  - Specification approach: Define performance requirements and site constraints; allow equipment suppliers to propose technology meeting requirements; pre-qualify limited number of OWS manufacturers whose equipment is proven to meet similar applications (canola oil or vegetable oil processing facilities); require performance testing during commissioning to verify compliance (supports DEL-03.05 performance test records per Specification §IF-1).
- **Status**: Recommend performance-based approach with pre-qualified manufacturers (ASSUMPTION: balance performance flexibility with proven technology); specification defines treatment performance, discharge limits, site constraints; allows equipment suppliers to propose gravity separator, coalescing separator, or other technology meeting performance; contractor shall demonstrate proposed technology has successful installations in similar applications (vegetable oil processing or transload facilities).
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §PR-2 OWS treatment capacity and containment performance; Specification §FR-2 environmental protection performance; P-2 environmental protection performance (OBJ-7); T-1 performance vs prescriptive specifications trade-off; Datasheet §Construction OWS specification content.

**T-3: Trenchless Crossing Specification Detail**
- **Trade-off**: Choose between detailed trenchless crossing specification (specify boring method, casing pipe installation procedures, grouting procedures, QA/QC inspection requirements in detail) and performance-based specification (specify performance requirements, allow boring contractor to propose methods and procedures).
- **Competing Concerns**:
  - **Detailed specification**: Provides certainty for critical crossings (beneath roads, rail tracks, existing utilities), ensures boring contractor understands expectations, simplifies QA/QC verification; but limits contractor means-and-methods flexibility (contractors may have preferred boring methods that differ from specified method), may increase cost if specified method is not contractor's usual method, may exclude newer boring technologies.
  - **Performance-based specification**: Allows boring contractors to use their preferred methods and equipment (auger boring, microtunneling, HDD, pipe jacking), encourages competition and cost optimization, enables use of newer technologies; but requires clear performance criteria (alignment tolerances, casing pipe installation requirements, grouting requirements, surface settlement limits), more detailed submittal review to evaluate proposed methods, may have higher risk if contractor proposes unfamiliar method.
- **Decision Guidance**:
  - Define clear performance requirements: Alignment tolerances (horizontal and vertical deviation limits), casing pipe requirements (material, diameter, wall thickness, jointing method, corrosion protection), carrier pipe installation requirements (support spacing, annular space grouting, testing), surface settlement limits (especially for crossings beneath roads or rail tracks).
  - Evaluate crossing criticality and constraints: Crossings beneath major roads, active rail tracks, or critical existing utilities require more detailed specification and QA/QC oversight; crossings in open areas with fewer constraints can use performance-based approach with more contractor flexibility.
  - Specification approach: Define performance requirements (alignment, casing, carrier pipe, grouting, settlement limits); list acceptable boring methods (auger boring per ASTM F1962, microtunneling, HDD) with performance criteria for each; require contractor to submit boring plan including proposed method, equipment, procedures, QA/QC plan for review and approval before commencing work (supports Procedure §Verification interdisciplinary check).
  - Include general note in specification: "Boring contractor shall submit detailed boring method, equipment specifications, soil investigation results, jacking force calculations, settlement predictions, and QA/QC procedures for review and approval before commencing work. Contractor shall verify locations of existing utilities via potholing and non-destructive investigation before boring."
- **Status**: Recommend performance-based specification with contractor-submitted boring plan (ASSUMPTION: balance performance certainty with contractor flexibility); specification defines performance requirements, allows contractor to propose boring method and procedures meeting requirements, requires submittal and approval of boring plan before work commences.
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §Scope trenchless crossing specification; Datasheet §Construction trenchless crossing specification content; P-3 material and workmanship clarity; C-5 construction use and material flexibility; T-1 performance vs prescriptive specifications.

**T-4: Duct Bank Specification Coordination with Electrical**
- **Trade-off**: Decide whether civil specification (this deliverable, DEL-03.02) should include detailed duct bank conduit specifications (conduit type, size, material, quantities) or should focus on civil trench and concrete encasement specifications only and reference electrical package (PKG-17) for conduit details.
- **Competing Concerns**:
  - **Include conduit details in civil spec**: Civil contractor has complete specification for duct bank construction (trench, conduit, concrete, backfill all in one document), simplifies construction execution; but duplicates information from electrical package (PKG-17), creates coordination burden if electrical design changes (civil spec must be revised to match), may cause conflicts if civil spec and electrical spec have different conduit requirements.
  - **Reference electrical spec for conduit details**: Avoids duplication, maintains electrical discipline ownership of conduit specifications, simplifies coordination if electrical design changes (civil spec doesn't need revision); but civil contractor must reference multiple specifications (civil for trench/concrete, electrical for conduit), potential for confusion if interface between civil and electrical scope is unclear.
- **Decision Guidance**:
  - Define clear scope interface: Civil specification covers trench excavation, trench dimensions, concrete encasement (mix design, placement, curing), pull box installation (materials, installation, backfill), backfill and compaction, pavement restoration. Electrical specification (PKG-17) covers conduit specifications (type, size, material, quantities), conduit routing and separation within trench, pull box internal configuration, cable installation.
  - Civil specification includes conduit information needed for civil construction: Trench dimensions based on conduit quantity and separation requirements (get from PKG-17 coordination); concrete encasement dimensions and reinforcement (if applicable); pull box size and spacing (coordinate with PKG-17); conduit material requirements affecting concrete placement (PVC conduit may require different concrete placement procedures than HDPE conduit).
  - Coordination approach: Civil specification includes general statement: "Conduit type, size, material, quantities, and routing per PKG-17 Electrical Power Distribution specifications and drawings. Coordinate trench dimensions, concrete encasement details, and pull box locations with PKG-17 before construction." Include conduit schedule table in specification or reference DEL-03.01 Drawing Set conduit schedule for civil contractor to understand trench sizing requirements.
- **Status**: Recommend civil specification includes trench/concrete/backfill requirements plus reference to PKG-17 for conduit details (ASSUMPTION: clear scope interface between civil and electrical); civil specification includes coordination notes and references to avoid duplication while providing sufficient information for civil contractor execution.
- **Cross-reference**: Specification §IF-2 coordination with PKG-17 Electrical; Specification §FR-3 coordination with electrical infrastructure; Datasheet §Construction duct bank specification content; P-4 coordination with installation records (duct banks support electrical, coordination is priority); C-4 QA coordination consideration.
