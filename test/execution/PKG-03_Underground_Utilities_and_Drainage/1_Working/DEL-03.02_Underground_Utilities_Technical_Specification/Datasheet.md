## Conditions

**Design context:**
- Defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for underground utilities in PKG-03, covering storm drainage, OWS, and duct banks (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).
- Supports the environmental protection objective (OBJ-7) through controls on containment water collection and conveyance (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Targets civil discipline requirements that need to align with the Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2: Civil & Process Mechanical Works (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Guidance.md: Purpose and Principles provide the rationale for how the specification sections should frame the design response relative to the drawing set and data sheets.

## Construction

**Specification coverage:**
- Storm drainage specification, OWS specification, and duct bank specification per the anticipated artifacts list (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).
- Material selections, workmanship expectations, and coordination points are documented within the specification sections and are referenced in the Procedure's steps for QA/QC review (Procedure.md: Steps).
- Performance validation, inspection requirements, and documentation expectations are captured in Specification.md, and the Procedure outlines how each requirement is verified and recorded.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Specification: Ensure the Datasheet's metadata fields (numbering, subject, applicable standard) align with the Specification's documentation expectations so reviewers trace requirements via the same identifiers (Specification.md: Documentation).
- Guidance: Follow the Guidance principles so the Datasheet reflects the intended rationale for environmental protection and inspections (Guidance.md: Principles).
- Procedure: The Datasheet’s reference to QA checklists should track the steps listed in the Procedure so the requirement approvals are captured chronologically (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
