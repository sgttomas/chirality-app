## Conditions

**Context & environmental expectations:**
- Defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for underground utilities in PKG-03, covering storm drainage systems, oil-water separator (OWS), duct banks, and trenchless utility crossings to support design drawings (DEL-03.01) and installation execution (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199; Specification §Scope provides detailed coverage).
- Designed to support storm drainage collection and conveyance, spill containment via OWS, and conduit routing within Fraser Surrey Terminal facility boundaries per Scope Focus (Contractor scope only, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47; Specification §Scope exclusions clarifies what is NOT in specification).
- Deliverable supports **OBJ-7 Environmental Protection**; specification must clearly capture containment system performance requirements, OWS treatment criteria, and discharge limits to demonstrate compliance with environmental protection requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; elaborated in Guidance §P-2 environmental protection performance principle; implemented via Procedure §5 environmental protection requirements definition; verified via Specification §FR-2 requirement and Procedure §7.3.3 independent check).
- Performance criteria (hydraulic capacity, structural loading, design life, temperature range, seismic criteria, chemical resistance for OWS) follow the civil design brief and Employer's Requirements civil standards; specific values remain TBD until Volume 2 Part 2 clauses are extracted and design calculations (DEL-03.03) are completed (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD; see Specification §PR-3 design life and environmental conditions requirement; Procedure §Prerequisites lists civil design brief and DEL-03.03 as required references; Guidance §C-2 addresses ER extraction consideration).
- Coordinate specification metadata, revision process, and section organization with the Specification §FR-4 and §Documentation requirements to ensure specification control aligns with project document management procedures (cross-reference: Specification §FR-4 document metadata requirement implemented via Procedure §6 metadata compilation and §8 issue into document control).

**Operational context:**
- Specification is used by material suppliers for submittal preparation, by construction contractors for installation execution, by QA/QC for inspection verification (see Procedure §Verification and §7 for review workflow), and by operations for maintenance planning (ASSUMPTION per typical specification lifecycle; Guidance §C-5 construction use and as-built reference consideration explains balancing material clarity with installation flexibility).
- Environmental protection requirements (OWS treatment performance, discharge limits, containment system criteria) are critical for permitting and regulatory compliance; specification clarity directly affects material approval and installation inspection outcomes (rationale in Guidance §P-2 environmental protection performance principle; Procedure §5 environmental protection requirements definition implements clear performance criteria).

## Construction

**Materials & performance focus:**
- Primary systems documented in the technical specification include:
  - **Storm drainage**: Pipe material specifications (HDPE, concrete, PVC), pipe performance requirements (ring stiffness, crush resistance, chemical resistance), jointing methods, bedding and backfill specifications, manhole and catch basin materials and construction requirements (Specification §Scope lists "storm drainage specification"; Procedure §4.1 describes storm drainage requirements development; Guidance §P-1 hydraulic performance and durability principle and §Example 1 provide implementation guidance).
  - **Oil-Water Separator (OWS)**: Treatment performance criteria (oil removal efficiency, solids settling capacity, flow rate capacity), materials of construction (separator internals, coatings, access hatches), instrumentation requirements (level sensors, flow meters, alarms), discharge limits and monitoring requirements (cross-reference: DEL-03.01 Drawing Set for OWS layout geometry per Specification §IF-1; DEL-03.04 Data Sheet Package for equipment specifications per Specification §PR-2; Procedure §4.2 describes OWS requirements development; Guidance §P-2 emphasizes environmental protection performance for OBJ-7 compliance; Guidance §Example 2 provides OWS specification structure guidance).
  - **Duct banks**: Conduit material specifications (PVC, HDPE), concrete encasement requirements (mix design, reinforcement, curing), pull box materials and installation, separation requirements from other utilities, trench backfill and compaction (Specification §Scope lists "duct bank specification"; coordinate with PKG-17 Electrical per Specification §IF-1; Procedure §4.3 describes duct bank requirements development; Guidance §T-4 duct bank specification detail trade-off recommends detailed material specs + reference to PKG-17 for electrical requirements; Guidance §Example 3 provides duct bank specification guidance).
  - **Trenchless crossings**: Boring and jacking methods (auger boring, microtunneling, horizontal directional drilling), casing pipe specifications (steel pipe, welding requirements, corrosion protection), carrier pipe installation inside casing, annular space grouting requirements, entry/exit pit construction (Specification §Scope lists "trenchless crossing specification"; Procedure §4.4 describes trenchless crossing requirements development; Guidance §T-3 trenchless crossing specification detail trade-off recommends performance-based approach allowing contractor means-and-methods flexibility; Guidance §Example 4 provides crossing specification guidance).
- Installation workmanship requirements (installation tolerances, alignment requirements, joint installation procedures, testing and inspection protocols) are documented in specification sections and support installation records (DEL-03.05) (ASSUMPTION per typical specification / installation records separation of concerns; see Specification §Scope coverage and §IF-2 linkage to related deliverables; Procedure §2.2 describes coordinating with DEL-03.05 installation requirements).
- Testing and inspection requirements (hydrostatic pressure testing for storm drainage, CCTV inspection of pipe interiors, OWS performance testing, duct bank continuity testing) are specified to support quality assurance and commissioning (DEL-03.05 Installation and Test Records will document test results; see Specification §QR-3 testing and inspection requirements; Procedure §4.5 describes testing requirements development).

**Specification organization (ASSUMPTION per typical civil specification structure; Guidance §C-3 emphasizes section structure to avoid scope creep):**
- General requirements: Scope, references, definitions, submittals, quality assurance, delivery/storage/handling
- Storm drainage system: Materials (pipe, manholes, catch basins, fittings), installation requirements, testing and inspection
- Oil-water separator system: Performance criteria, materials of construction, instrumentation, installation requirements, performance testing
- Duct bank system: Conduit materials, concrete encasement, pull boxes, installation requirements, testing
- Trenchless crossing system: Boring methods, casing and carrier pipes, grouting, testing
- Backfill and restoration: Trench backfill materials, compaction requirements, pavement restoration
(Procedure §3.2 establishes specification section structure; Procedure §2.4 describes documenting applicable standards and references in specification general requirements)

**Document Maturity:**
- This Datasheet, along with Specification, Guidance, and Procedure, has completed three enrichment passes (Pass 1 initial generation, Pass 2 cross-reference and detail enrichment, Pass 3 final reconciliation).
- Documents are ready for WORKING_ITEMS sessions where human engineer will refine, validate, and populate TBD items as design development proceeds and design calculations (DEL-03.03) mature.
