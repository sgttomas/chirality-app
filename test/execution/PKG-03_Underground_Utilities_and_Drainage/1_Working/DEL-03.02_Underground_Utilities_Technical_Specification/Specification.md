# Specification: DEL-03.02 Underground Utilities Technical Specification

## Scope
This deliverable defines the performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for the underground utilities described in PKG-03, including storm drainage, oil-water separator, and duct bank systems (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Define performance and materials specific to storm drainage, OWS, and duct bank systems to ensure underground utilities meet the Employer's Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Document the expected inspection and documentation deliverables (pressure test records, CCTV logs, etc.) so installation packages know how to demonstrate compliance.
- Coordinate with Datasheet.md to link the metadata (document numbers, revision status) to the sections describing material and workmanship controls.

### Performance Requirements
- Specify hydraulic capacity, structural capacity, and durability criteria aligned with the project objectives for environmental protection and throughput (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786 & Project Overview section).
- Require reliability in containment systems so that stormwater and potentially contaminated runoff remain isolated per the Employer's environmental protection objectives (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Cross-check performance expectations against the Guidance principles to confirm trade-offs (Guidance.md: Trade-offs) and use the Procedure verification steps to confirm compliance.

### Interface Requirements
- Coordinate with earthworks (PKG-02) for trench backfill and grading, and with pavements (PKG-04) for surface penetrations; these relationships are managed through external coordination workflows (Dependency mode: NOT_TRACKED — see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).
- Provide clear crossover points where OWS discharge ties into site drainage so downstream utilities understand connection conditions.
- Align with the Drawing Set deliverable (DEL-03.01) so that specification clauses reference the corresponding plan/profile sheets and data elements (DEL-03.01 Specification for references).

### Quality Requirements
- Align with the project Quality Management Plan and document control procedures described in Volume 2 Part 1 of the Employer's Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Ensure all specification sections contain acceptance criteria and references to verification steps that the QA/QC team can check before issue, as described in Procedure.md: Verification.
- Preserve terminology consistency with Guidance.md so downstream deliverables do not create contradictory language.

## Standards
- Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2: Civil & Process Mechanical Works provides the civil specifications to incorporate (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Project Quality Management Plan and document control conventions are sourced from Volume 2 Part 1 (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Additional standards (e.g., CSA S6 for structural elements, TAC guidance for drainage) will be identified during detailed design; specifics remain TBD until the referenced documents are reviewed.

## Verification
- Verification occurs through specification and document reviews, QA checklists, and sign-off processes consistent with the Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Each specification section cross-references the associated verification method (e.g., material submittal review, shop drawing certification) before release for contracting, per Procedure.md.
- Capture verification status in the Datasheet metadata and link back to the Procedure's sign-off steps so that the Drawing Set and Data Sheet Package track the same checklist items.

## Documentation
- Deliverable artifacts include storm drainage specification, OWS specification, and duct bank specification as listed in `_CONTEXT.md` (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:199).
- Include traceability matrices linking requirements to verification and reference documents.
- Maintain revision history, approvals, and distribution records per project document control standards outlined in Volume 2 Part 1.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Use the Datasheet’s metadata and conditions to verify that the specification sections reference the same subject matter and documentation controls (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Guidance: The Guidance considerations explain why the specification emphasizes containment, inspection, and coordination sections, so reviewers can link rationale to requirements (Guidance.md: Considerations).
- Procedure: Verification steps within Procedure.md demonstrate how each specification clause advances through QA before being handed to construction (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
