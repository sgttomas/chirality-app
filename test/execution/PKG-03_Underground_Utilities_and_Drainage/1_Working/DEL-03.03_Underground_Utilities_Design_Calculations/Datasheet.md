## Identification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Deliverable ID | DEL-03.03 |
| Name | Underground Utilities Design Calculations |
| Package | PKG-03 Underground Utilities & Drainage |
| Discipline | Civil |
| Type | Calculation |
| Responsible | D&B Contractor |
| Status | INITIALIZED |

## Attributes

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Calculation Package | Drainage, OWS sizing, duct bank capacity (aligned with Specification requirements) |
| Revision | 00 |
| Software | Owner-specified hydraulic modeling tool (TBD) |
| Scope | Storm drainage, OWS, trenchless crossings per PKG-03 requirements |

## Conditions

- Delivers the engineering basis and sizing calculations that substantiate the underground utilities described in PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).
- Supports the environmental protection objective (OBJ-7) by demonstrating containment, conveyance, and hydraulic performance (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Assumes design inputs from survey, site grading, and Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works).
- Guidance.md: Principles outlines the rationale for the calculation focus (hydraulics and containment), ensuring consistent terminology with Specifications and Drawings.

## Construction

- Outputs include drainage calculations, OWS sizing, and duct bank capacity calculations as referenced in `_CONTEXT.md` anticipated artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).
- Clearing of design assumptions, calculation logs, and summary tables support the downstream specification and drawing deliverables (see DEL-03.01 Specification and DEL-03.02 Specification for requirement traceability).
- Format and digitization follow project calculation controls outlined in the Quality Management Plan (Volume 2 Part 1) and Verification steps in Procedure.md.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Specification: Ensure the Datasheet lists the calculation package and scope items that map directly to the Specification’s functional and performance requirements (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Guidance: Use the Guidance principles to justify assumptions and rationale stated in the Datasheet’s conditions section, reinforcing consistent terminology (Guidance.md: Principles, Considerations).
- Procedure: The Datasheet’s Construction statements refer to Procedure steps to show how calculation logs move through QA (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
