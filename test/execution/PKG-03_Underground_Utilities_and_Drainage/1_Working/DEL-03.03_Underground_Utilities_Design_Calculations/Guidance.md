# Guidance: DEL-03.03 Underground Utilities Design Calculations

## Purpose
- Guide the development of the underground utilities calculation package for PKG-03, ensuring that drainage, OWS, and duct bank sizing reflect the project objectives (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).
- Provide decision-making context so the calculations feed accurate inputs into subsequent drawing and specification deliverables.

## Principles
- Anchor every calculation assumption to a documented data source (survey, project overview, or Employer's Requirements) to support traceability.
- Prioritize environmental protection by modeling worst-case runoff and containment volumes that reflect OBJ-7 for PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Maintain consistent units, notation, and terminology with the drawing and specification packages to avoid conversion errors during coordination.
- Tie the guidance rationale back to the Procedure verification steps so reviewers see how each assumption is checked before the outputs feed DEL-03.01 and DEL-03.02 (Procedure.md: Verification).

## Considerations
- Confirm site grades, as-built utility locations, and proposed elevations before finalizing hydraulic profiles.
- Coordinate with DEL-03.01 (Drawings) to ensure the vertical/horizontal alignments used in calculations match the planned trench corridors.
- Document any assumptions about flow rates, retention times, or material properties and flag them for verification in DEL-03.01 and DEL-03.02.
- Capture those assumptions within Procedure.md steps so they also appear in the Datasheet attributes for traceability (Procedure.md: Steps; Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Align the calculation format with the Quality Management Plan's calculation control sheets (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Guidance principles explain why each calculation attribute and scope item is documented, keeping the Datasheet and Guidance language aligned (Datasheet.md: Conditions).
- Specification: Guidance’s emphasis on containment/hydraulics underpins the Specification’s functional requirements so reviewers can see the rationale for each clause (Specification.md: Functional Requirements).
- Procedure: Procedure steps reference this Guidance when describing verification, enabling reviewers to trace how the principles are checked before release (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).

## Trade-offs
- Balance calculation detail with the need to issue results quickly; use conservative assumptions where data is lacking but note them for revision.
- Sequence drainage vs duct bank priorities when space conflicts arise; use the calculations to justify whichever layout better serves OBJ-7 and throughput objectives.

## Examples
- Provide sample drainage hydrographs or inflow-outflow tables that demonstrate compliance with the Employer's stormwater expectations (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Use finalized calculation outputs to seed the specification requirements in DEL-03.02 and to annotate control points in the drawing set for DEL-03.01.
