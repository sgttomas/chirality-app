# Specification: DEL-03.03 Underground Utilities Design Calculations

## Scope
Defines the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for underground utilities under PKG-03, including drainage hydraulics, OWS sizing, and duct bank capacity (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide detailed drainage calculations that demonstrate compliance with the Employer's stormwater performance expectations (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Document oil-water separator sizing (volumes, retention times, controls) to satisfy environmental protection objectives (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Derive duct bank capacity calculations that confirm routing, spacing, and conduit fill factors are within acceptable limits for the proposed underground utilities network.
- Reference Guidance.md to ensure the rationale behind hydraulic focus and containment modeling is captured before the calculations feed the Drawing Set and Specification deliverables (Guidance.md: Principles).

### Performance Requirements
- Hydraulics must accommodate peak runoff for the permitted throughput and storage defined in the project overview (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md, Project Overview section).
- Structural and geotechnical interactions defined in calculations must respect subsurface conditions addressed in Earthworks deliverables (Scope focus: civil contractor scope only, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).

### Interface Requirements
- Coordinate calculation assumptions with DEL-03.01 (Drawings) and DEL-03.02 (Specification) to ensure downstream deliverables reflect the same performance criteria.
- Inputs from adjacent packages (earthworks, structural, and process systems) must be tracked via external coordination records (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).
- Capture any assumptions or deviations for review in Procedure.md so that the Datasheet identifies them in its Attributes section (Procedure.md: Steps).

### Quality Requirements
- Calculation packages must include input-data summaries, modeling assumptions, and validation steps consistent with the project Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Include a reviewer checklist and documented review comments before issuance.

## Standards
- Follow Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 for hydraulic, containment, and duct bank guidance (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Use quality and calculation protocol guidance in Volume 2 Part 1 (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Verification
- Verification includes independent calculation checks, alignment with design drawings, and sign-offs per the Quality Management Plan.
- Document validation of hydraulic models and iteration results before releasing calculations; link verification status to the Datasheet for traceability (Datasheet.md: Construction).

## Documentation
- Deliverables include drainage calculations, OWS sizing documents, and duct bank capacity calculations as listed in `_CONTEXT.md` (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).
- Retain calculation logs, input/output tables, and review memos together with the calculation report for traceability.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The specification references the same calculation package/scope details so the Datasheet and Specification remain in sync for deliverable identification (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Guidance: The Guidance rationale frames why each requirement exists and keeps terminology consistent between requirements and calculations (Guidance.md: Principles).
- Procedure: The Procedure steps outline how the Specification verification items are executed, closing the loop between requirement and review (Procedure.md: Steps).
