# Procedure: DEL-03.03 Underground Utilities Design Calculations

## Purpose
- Define the process for developing, checking, and documenting the drainage, OWS, and duct bank calculations that underpin PKG-03 underground utilities (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are coordinated externally (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm inputs from site grading (DEL-02.x) and the drawing set (DEL-03.01).
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 for civil calculations, project Quality Management Plan in Volume 2 Part 1, and any site data in `0_References/_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
- **Guidance alignment:** Use Guidance.md to confirm the engineering principles that drive the calculation focus (hydraulics, containment, duct banks) before modeling.
- **Data inputs:** Survey control, rainfall data, load cases, and existing utility records.
- **Personnel:** Civil calculation engineer, checker/reviewer, and QA coordinator (ASSUMPTION: per Quality Management Plan).

## Steps
1. Review the decomposition entry and `_CONTEXT.md` to confirm the downstream expectations for drainage, OWS, and duct bank sizing (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:200).
2. Assemble hydraulic inputs (rainfall, runoff coefficients, flow paths) and structural inputs (pipe strengths, cover requirements).
3. Develop calculation models for storm drainage, OWS retention/sizing, and duct bank capacity, documenting assumptions and referencing Employer's Requirements clauses.
4. Validate results with peer review, ensuring outputs support DEL-03.02 and DEL-03.01 narrative requirements as described in the Specification and Drawing Set (Specification.md: Interface Requirements; DEL-03.01 Specification: Requirements).
5. Update verification logs, track review comments, and file calculation reports in the document control system so the Datasheet reflects the reviewed revision and verification status (Datasheet.md: Attributes; Documentation).

## Verification
- Peer check of calculation logic and units.
- Independent review for alignment with Employer's Requirements and project objectives (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Confirmation that results match drawing annotations and specification requirements.

## Records
- Calculation reports, modeling files, input data tables, and review checklists retained per the Quality Management Plan.
- Traceability matrix linking each load case to the requirement it satisfies.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Procedure verification log entry ensures the Datasheet metadata reflects the completed review steps (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Steps 2-5 map directly to the Specification requirements so readers can trace how calculation outcomes satisfy each clause (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Guidance: Use the Guidance considerations to frame the assumption handling described in the Procedure and keep language consistent (Guidance.md: Considerations).
