# Procedure: DEL-03.05 Underground Utilities Installation & Test Records

## Purpose
- Define how pressure tests, CCTV inspections, and as-built surveys for PKG-03 underground utilities are executed, recorded, and retained (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:202).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm that installations reflected in DEL-03.01 (Drawings) and DEL-03.02 (Specification) have been completed or are ready for testing.
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 1 (Quality Management) and Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works), package reference index (`execution/PKG-03_Underground_Utilities_and_Drainage/0_References/_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`).
- **Data inputs:** Test procedures, calibration records, CCTV routing plans, and survey control data.
- **Guidance alignment:** Use Guidance.md trade-offs to decide how much detail to capture in each record and which remediation recommendations require immediate follow-up.
- **Personnel:** QA/QC inspector, CCTV surveyor, scribe/data recorder.

## Steps
1. Prepare test plans for pressure testing, CCTV surveys, and surveys, referencing the design drawings and data sheets to ensure accuracy and consistency with Specification requirements (Specification.md: Interface Requirements).
2. Execute pressure tests, documenting applied pressures, durations, and acceptance criteria; capture the results in the Datasheet metadata to record the revision history (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
3. Conduct CCTV surveys on storm pipes and culverts; log defects using the project's defect coding system and note remediation recommendations (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
4. Perform as-built surveys capturing final locations, elevations, and tie-ins for the underground utilities.
5. Compile records into an installation & test log, review per QA procedures, and archive them in the project document control system while remarking any deviations per Procedure requirements.

## Verification
- QA checks confirm that each test record includes required data fields, reviewer initials, and pass/fail status.
- CCTV and survey data are cross-referenced with the drawing set to ensure spatial consistency.
- Inspection log sign-offs are stored per the Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf) and recorded in the Datasheet metadata to document completion.

## Records
- Pressure test reports, CCTV inspection logs, as-built survey drawings, and remediation documentation.
- QA review checklists and traceability tables linking records to requirements and deliverables.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: The Procedure verification steps ensure Datasheet metadata (coverage, storage location) reflects completed QA tasks (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Each step draws directly from the Specification’s requirements so reviewers can see how the records satisfy contractual obligations (Specification.md: Verification).
- Guidance: Guidance trade-offs guide how much detail is captured and whether remediation recommendations proceed immediately, so Procedure references it when prioritizing records (Guidance.md: Trade-offs).
