# Guidance: DEL-03.05 Underground Utilities Installation & Test Records

## Purpose
- Guide the capture of installation and test evidence for PKG-03 underground utilities so that pressure tests, CCTV inspections, and surveys are fully documented (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:202).
- Ensure these records demonstrate compliance with environmental protection objectives (OBJ-7) by highlighting containment and drainage verifications (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).

## Principles
- Treat each record as part of a traceable chain that links installation methods (DEL-03.01), specifications (DEL-03.02), and calculations (DEL-03.03).
- Ensure the record structure mirrors the Specification's verification requirements so reviewers can see how each inspection contributes to compliance (Specification.md: Quality Requirements).
- Maintain clarity in CCTV reports and inspection logs so remediation recommendations are actionable.
- Retain QA/QC signature blocks and verification dates consistent with the Quality Management Plan (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Considerations
- Ensure pressure tests are conducted after trench backfill but before paving, coordinating with DEL-03.04 data for material requirements.
- Follow Procedure.md steps so the timing of pressure tests, CCTV surveys, and as-built surveys matches the documented workflow and feeds accurate entries into the Datasheet (Procedure.md: Steps; Datasheet.md: Conditions).
- Follow Procedure.md steps so the timing of pressure tests, CCTV surveys, and as-built surveys matches the documented workflow and feeds accurate entries into the Datasheet (Procedure.md: Steps; Datasheet.md: Conditions).
- CCTV survey logs should reference the drawing numbers and pipe codes from the drawing set to avoid misalignment.
- As-built surveys must confirm the final configuration of utilities for inclusion in commissioning records and future operations documents.

## Trade-offs
- Capture enough detail in logs to demonstrate compliance without overburdening field teams with paperwork.
- Decide between live digital recording versus manual logs depending on site connectivity and equipment availability.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Guidance trade-offs justify how much detail is captured in the Datasheet coverage table, promoting consistent record logging (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: The Guidance considerations assert the need to reference drawings and materials, giving the Specification’s interface clauses tangible examples (Specification.md: Interface Requirements).
- Procedure: The Procedure steps use this Guidance to decide on the sequencing and verification focus, especially when environmental containment concerns arise (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).

## Examples
- Pressure test records should include pressure duration, acceptance criteria, leak detection, and sign-offs.
- CCTV inspection records should include defect coding, location referencing, and recommended remediation steps as indicated in `_CONTEXT.md` anticipated artifacts.
