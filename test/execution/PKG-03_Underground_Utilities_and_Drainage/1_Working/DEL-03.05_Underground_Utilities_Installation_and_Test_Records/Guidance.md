# Guidance: DEL-03.05 Underground Utilities Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Provide decision-making context and engineering rationale for capturing installation and test records for PKG-03 Underground Utilities, ensuring that pressure testing, CCTV inspection, OWS performance verification, and commissioning documentation demonstrate conformance, support regulatory compliance, and enable operations handover.

**Why this deliverable matters:**
- Installation and test records provide objective evidence that underground utilities were installed per design requirements (DEL-03.01 drawings, DEL-03.02 specification, DEL-03.03 calculations) and meet performance expectations; complete records prevent future disputes and support warranty claims (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:202).
- Environmental protection testing records (OWS performance verification, containment integrity testing, discharge monitoring instrumentation calibration) directly support **OBJ-7 Environmental Protection** by demonstrating treatment system adequacy and regulatory compliance; incomplete testing delays commissioning and regulatory approval (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; Specification §FR-2).
- Installation and test records create permanent construction quality record for operations maintenance, system troubleshooting, future modifications, and regulatory inspections; well-organized records reduce operations costs and support facility lifecycle management (rationale for Specification §QR-1 Quality Management Plan compliance; supports Datasheet §Conditions operational context).

## Principles

**P-1: Hydraulic Integrity Verification**
- Pressure testing, leak testing, and flow testing must demonstrate that underground utilities (storm drainage pipes, OWS piping connections, duct bank conduits) are installed leak-free and meet hydraulic performance requirements; inadequate testing creates future failure risk and environmental liability.
- **Application:** Execute pressure testing per acceptance criteria (test duration, allowable pressure drop); document leak detection and repairs with retest verification; measure flow rates and compare to design flows from DEL-03.03 calculations; document all test execution steps, test results, and inspector sign-offs.
- **Rationale:** Leak-free installation prevents groundwater infiltration, soil erosion, and environmental contamination; flow testing validates hydraulic design assumptions and confirms system capacity (supports Specification §FR-1 and §PR-1).
- **Cross-reference:** Datasheet §Construction pressure test records, leak test records, flow testing records; Procedure §4 pressure testing, §5 flow testing; Specification §FR-1 and §PR-1.

**P-2: Environmental Protection Verification**
- OWS performance verification testing, containment integrity testing, and discharge monitoring instrumentation calibration must demonstrate **OBJ-7 Environmental Protection** compliance to support environmental permits, regulatory approval, and commissioning acceptance.
- **Application:** Execute OWS performance testing (flow capacity testing, retention time measurement, treatment efficiency testing with oil removal efficiency measurement, discharge water quality laboratory analysis); verify containment integrity (visual inspection, hydrostatic or dye testing, leak detection); calibrate discharge monitoring instrumentation (level sensors, flow meters, oil layer thickness monitors); document all test results, laboratory analysis reports, and commissioning sign-offs.
- **Rationale:** Environmental permits specify treatment performance and discharge limits; OWS performance testing demonstrates permit compliance; containment integrity testing prevents spill migration; instrumentation calibration ensures continuous monitoring accuracy (supports Specification §FR-2 and §PR-2).
- **Cross-reference:** Datasheet §Construction OWS performance verification records, containment integrity test records; Procedure §6 OWS performance verification testing; Specification §FR-2; Example 3 OWS performance test record structure.

**P-3: Pipe Condition Verification**
- CCTV inspection must identify pipe defects, assess pipe condition, and support remediation planning to prevent future failures and ensure design life; inadequate inspection creates undetected defect risk and future maintenance costs.
- **Application:** Execute CCTV inspection with video capture, defect coding (defect type, severity, location/chainage), location referencing (manholes, tie-in points), defect photography, and remediation recommendations; coordinate with DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report for detailed defect analysis.
- **Rationale:** CCTV inspection provides baseline pipe condition for future maintenance; defect identification enables proactive remediation planning; video documentation supports future investigations and modifications (supports Specification §FR-3).
- **Cross-reference:** Datasheet §Construction CCTV inspection records; Procedure §7.1 CCTV inspection execution; Specification §FR-3; Example 2 CCTV inspection record structure.

**P-4: Installation Traceability and Acceptance**
- Installation and test records must maintain traceability to design deliverables (DEL-03.01/02/03/04), test standards, test equipment calibration, and inspector qualifications to support conformance verification and commissioning acceptance; incomplete traceability creates QA gaps and delays handover.
- **Application:** Reference design deliverables in test records (drawing numbers, specification clauses, calculation references, data sheet specifications); document test equipment calibration with certificate references; record inspector names and qualifications; maintain QA sign-offs throughout testing; compile commissioning documentation integrating all installation and test records.
- **Rationale:** Traceability demonstrates that installed systems match design intent; calibrated test equipment ensures result validity; qualified inspectors provide credible conformance verification; integrated commissioning documentation supports regulatory approval and operations handover (supports Specification §FR-5 and §QR-1).
- **Cross-reference:** Datasheet §Conditions operational context (QA/QC, commissioning, operations); Procedure §8 commissioning documentation; Specification §FR-5; Consideration C-5 QA sign-offs and commissioning coordination.

## Considerations

**C-1: Test Equipment Calibration**
- All test equipment (pressure gauges, flow meters, survey equipment, instrumentation) requires calibration to traceable standards; calibration certificate availability and validity affect test result acceptance.
- **Impact:** Expired calibration certificates invalidate test results requiring retesting; uncalibrated equipment creates test result uncertainty; missing calibration documentation delays commissioning acceptance.
- **Recommended approach:** Verify test equipment calibration before testing execution; maintain calibration certificate files; document calibration references in test records; plan retest schedule if calibration expires during testing program.
- **Cross-reference:** Specification §QR-2 test equipment calibration requirement; Datasheet §Conditions test equipment calibration TBD; Procedure §2.3 test equipment calibration verification.

**C-2: ER Compliance Demonstration**
- Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 contains testing procedures and acceptance criteria; installation and test records must demonstrate ER compliance for commissioning acceptance and regulatory approval.
- **Impact:** Testing procedures, acceptance criteria, performance standards are TBD pending ER extraction; test record content must address ER compliance verification needs; non-compliance requires retesting or remediation.
- **Recommended approach:** Review ER Volume 2 Part 2 for applicable testing requirements before testing execution; document ER compliance in test records with clause references; coordinate with Employer's Representative for acceptance criteria interpretation when needed.
- **Cross-reference:** Specification §Standards governing standards (ER Volume 2 Part 2); Datasheet §Conditions and §Attributes TBD from ER; Principle P-4 installation traceability.

**C-3: As-Built Accuracy**
- As-built survey accuracy requirements affect survey methodology and equipment selection; survey precision must support operations needs for future excavation, utility location, and system modifications.
- **Impact:** Survey accuracy standards (horizontal and vertical tolerance) are TBD pending ER extraction; inadequate survey accuracy creates future utility location uncertainty; excessive survey precision increases survey costs.
- **Recommended approach:** Review ER survey accuracy requirements; select survey equipment and methodology meeting accuracy standards; document survey control and accuracy verification; coordinate with operations team for utility location marking needs.
- **Cross-reference:** Specification §FR-4 as-built documentation requirement; Datasheet §Construction as-built survey records; Procedure §7.2 as-built survey execution.

**C-4: Record Structure and Scope Boundaries**
- Installation and test record package scope aligns with DEL-03.05 decomposition scope (PKG-03 underground utilities testing); avoid scope creep into adjacent package testing (e.g., process equipment testing in other packages).
- **Impact:** Scope boundaries between civil underground utilities testing and adjacent package testing must be clearly defined; OWS performance testing may overlap with process system commissioning.
- **Recommended approach:** Review decomposition scope during planning; organize records by test type matching Specification §Scope; identify interface testing requiring coordination; document scope boundaries in record introduction.
- **Cross-reference:** Specification §Scope anticipated record types and exclusions; Datasheet §Construction record package organization; Procedure §1 scope review.

**C-5: CCTV Record Coordination with DEL-03.06**
- CCTV inspection records captured in DEL-03.05 provide raw data for detailed analysis in DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report; record format and defect coding consistency affect DEL-03.06 efficiency.
- **Impact:** CCTV record format (video file indexing, defect coding system, location referencing) must support DEL-03.06 analysis; inconsistent defect coding creates analysis delays; missing location references prevent defect location identification.
- **Recommended approach:** Coordinate CCTV inspection procedures and defect coding system with DEL-03.06 development team before inspection execution; use consistent video file naming and indexing; maintain detailed location referencing (chainage, manholes, tie-ins); provide CCTV records to DEL-03.06 team promptly.
- **Cross-reference:** Specification §IF-2 coordination with DEL-03.06; Datasheet §References DEL-03.06 coordination; Procedure §7.1 CCTV inspection execution; Principle P-3 pipe condition verification.

**C-6: Operations Handover and Maintenance Reference**
- Installation and test records serve multiple uses: commissioning acceptance, regulatory compliance, operations handover, future maintenance reference; content must balance inspection detail with record usability.
- **Impact:** Commissioning needs integrated records demonstrating conformance; operations needs accessible reference for system troubleshooting; excessive detail reduces clarity; insufficient detail limits maintenance usefulness.
- **Recommended approach:** Organize records by system (storm drainage, OWS, duct banks) for efficient commissioning review; provide executive summary in record introduction; include as-built survey data for utility location; cross-reference detailed test data in appendices; coordinate handover format with operations team.
- **Cross-reference:** Datasheet §Conditions operational context; Principle P-4 installation traceability and acceptance; Specification §FR-5 record metadata for handover.

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Pressure Testing Detail vs Schedule**
- **Trade-off:** Detailed pressure testing (multiple test sections, extended test durations, multiple pressure levels) provides thorough leak detection but extends testing schedule; abbreviated testing reduces schedule but increases undetected leak risk.
- **Recommended approach:** Segment pressure testing by logical pipe sections (between manholes, by pipe material type) per DEL-03.02 specification requirements; use standard test durations from applicable standards (typically 2-4 hours for hydrostatic testing); document test execution methodology in test records; prioritize critical sections (OWS connections, containment piping) for extended testing if schedule permits.
- **Cross-reference:** Principle P-1 hydraulic integrity verification; Example 1 pressure test record; Specification §FR-1 and §PR-1.

**T-2: Flow Testing Detail**
- **Trade-off:** Comprehensive flow testing (multiple flow rates, flow distribution verification, extended monitoring) validates hydraulic design thoroughly but requires extensive instrumentation and time; simplified flow testing (single design flow rate, limited monitoring) reduces testing effort but provides less validation.
- **Recommended approach:** Test at design flow rate from DEL-03.03 calculations; measure flow at key locations (inlet, outlet, branch connections); compare measured flows to design flows within acceptance tolerance; document flow measurement equipment calibration; extend testing for complex systems (multiple drainage areas, OWS inlet/outlet flows) when validation is critical.
- **Cross-reference:** Principle P-1 hydraulic integrity verification; Specification §PR-1; Datasheet §Construction flow testing records.

**T-3: CCTV Inspection Detail vs Cost**
- **Trade-off:** Detailed CCTV inspection (slow camera speed, multiple passes, extensive defect documentation) provides thorough pipe condition assessment but increases inspection cost and schedule; rapid inspection reduces cost but may miss defects.
- **Recommended approach:** Follow standard CCTV inspection procedures from applicable standards (PACP or equivalent); use standard camera speed for initial inspection; conduct detailed inspection of identified defect areas; document all defects with severity coding and location referencing; coordinate with DEL-03.06 team for defect analysis priorities; balance inspection detail with budget and schedule constraints.
- **Cross-reference:** Principle P-3 pipe condition verification; Example 2 CCTV inspection record; Specification §FR-3; Consideration C-5 CCTV coordination with DEL-03.06.
