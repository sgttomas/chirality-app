| Storage Location | Project document control repository (TBD) |

## Conditions

- Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for underground utilities in PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:202).
- Records confirm hydraulic performance and material integrity in support of OBJ-7 Environmental Protection (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Supports installation verification for storm drainage, OWS, and duct bank systems defined in DEL-03.01 through DEL-03.04 and ties back to the Procedure verification checkpoints.

## Construction

- Includes pressure test procedures/results, CCTV inspection logs, and as-built survey data as anticipated artifacts (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`).
- Records align with QA/QC procedures described in Volume 2 Part 1 of the Employer's Requirements and reference the Specification's verification list (Specification.md: Quality Requirements).
- Data is organized to enable future reference during commissioning and compliance reviews, with Guidance.md covering the trade-offs in recording versus inspection depth.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Specification: The Datasheet entries should match the Spec’s identified record types and performance requirements, ensuring the recorded data fulfills stated criteria (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Guidance: Use the Guidance’s trade-off statements to choose how much detail to log for each inspection type (Guidance.md: Trade-offs).
- Procedure: Align the Datasheet’s verification metadata with the Procedure steps so QA sign-offs appear in both places (Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).
