## Conditions

**Context & environmental expectations:**
- Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for underground utilities described in PKG-03, covering storm drainage, oil-water separator (OWS), and duct bank systems to demonstrate compliance with design requirements (DEL-03.01 drawings, DEL-03.02 specification, DEL-03.03 calculations) and Employer's Requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:202; Specification §Scope provides detailed record coverage).
- Designed to support storm drainage collection and conveyance, spill containment via OWS, and conduit routing within Fraser Surrey Terminal facility boundaries per Scope Focus (Contractor scope only, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47; Specification §Scope exclusions clarifies what is NOT in record package).
- Deliverable supports **OBJ-7 Environmental Protection**; installation and test records must capture OWS performance verification (treatment capacity, retention volume, oil removal efficiency, discharge water quality), containment integrity testing, and environmental protection system commissioning to demonstrate environmental compliance (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; elaborated in Guidance §P-2 environmental protection verification principle; implemented via Procedure §6 OWS performance testing; verified via Specification §FR-2 requirement and Procedure §9.3.3 independent check).
- Installation and test procedures, acceptance criteria, and performance requirements are defined in Employer's Requirements and validated against design deliverables (DEL-03.01 drawings, DEL-03.02 specification, DEL-03.03 calculations, DEL-03.04 data sheets); test records demonstrate conformance and support regulatory compliance and commissioning handover (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf and test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, locations TBD; see Specification §PR-1 hydraulic performance and §PR-2 environmental performance requirements; Procedure §Prerequisites lists design deliverables as required references; Guidance §C-2 addresses ER compliance demonstration consideration).
- Coordinate record metadata, revision process, and content organization with the Specification §FR-5 and §Documentation requirements to ensure record control aligns with project Quality Management Plan and document control procedures (cross-reference: Specification §FR-5 record metadata and traceability requirement implemented via Procedure §8 metadata compilation and §10 archival into record management system).

**Operational context:**
- Installation and test records are used by QA/QC inspectors for conformance verification, by regulatory agencies for environmental compliance review, by commissioning teams for system acceptance, by operations teams for handover and as-built reference (see Procedure §Verification and §9 for review workflow), and by future maintenance teams for system troubleshooting and modification planning (ASSUMPTION per typical installation record lifecycle; Guidance §C-6 operations handover and maintenance reference consideration explains balancing inspection detail with record usability).
- Environmental protection testing records (OWS performance verification, containment integrity, discharge monitoring calibration) are critical for environmental permit compliance and regulatory inspections; record clarity and completeness directly affect commissioning acceptance and regulatory approval (rationale in Guidance §P-2 environmental protection verification principle; Procedure §6 OWS performance verification testing implements clear documentation).

## Construction

**Record types & content focus:**
- Primary records documented in the package include:
  - **Pressure test records**: Test identification (pipe section, test date, test crew), pre-test checklist (visual inspection, joint completion, backfill status, isolation valves, pressure gauge calibration), test execution log (initial pressure, test duration, pressure readings at intervals, leak detection observations), test results (pressure drop calculation, acceptance criteria comparison, pass/fail determination), reviewer signatures (inspector, supervisor) (Specification §Scope lists "pressure test records"; Procedure §4 describes pressure testing execution and record capture; Guidance §P-1 emphasizes hydraulic integrity verification principle; Guidance §Example 1 provides pressure test record structure guidance).
  - **Leak test records**: Similar structure to pressure test records with specific focus on leak detection methods (visual observation, soap bubble testing, electronic leak detection), leak location identification and repair documentation, retest verification after repairs (cross-reference: DEL-03.02 Technical Specification for leak test acceptance criteria per Specification §IF-1; Procedure §4.4 describes leak detection and documentation).
  - **Flow testing records**: Test identification, flow measurement equipment calibration, measured flow rates vs design flow rates (from DEL-03.03 calculations), flow distribution verification (multiple outlets), acceptance criteria comparison, test results documentation (Specification §Scope lists "flow testing records"; Procedure §5 describes flow testing for storm drainage; Guidance §T-2 flow testing detail trade-off recommends measured flows + comparison to DEL-03.03 design flows).
  - **CCTV inspection records**: Pipe section identification, inspection date and crew, video file references, defect coding log (defect type, severity, location/chainage, description), location referencing (manholes, tie-in points), defect photographs, remediation recommendations (cross-reference: DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report provides detailed analysis of CCTV findings per Specification §IF-2; DEL-03.01 Drawing Set for pipe locations and identification; Procedure §7 describes CCTV inspection execution and defect logging; Guidance §P-3 pipe condition verification principle emphasizes defect identification for future maintenance; Guidance §Example 2 provides CCTV inspection record structure).
  - **As-built survey records**: Final locations and elevations of installed utilities (pipe inverts, rim elevations, OWS location, duct bank routes), survey control tie-ins, deviations from design documented and approved, survey field notes and reduced data, survey accuracy verification (cross-reference: DEL-03.01 Drawing Set shows design locations for comparison per Specification §IF-1; Procedure §7 describes as-built survey execution; Guidance §C-3 as-built accuracy consideration discusses survey precision requirements).
  - **OWS performance verification records**: Equipment identification (OWS unit, location reference), pre-operational inspection checklist (internals condition, access hatches, instrumentation installation), flow testing (design flow, peak flow), retention time verification, treatment performance testing (oil removal efficiency measurement, discharge water quality sampling and laboratory analysis results), instrumentation calibration records (level sensors, flow meters, oil layer thickness monitors), acceptance criteria comparison (from DEL-03.02 specification and DEL-03.04 OWS data sheet), commissioning sign-off (Specification §Scope lists "OWS performance verification records"; Procedure §6 describes OWS performance testing execution; Guidance §P-2 environmental protection verification principle emphasizes OWS performance demonstration for OBJ-7 compliance; Guidance §Example 3 provides OWS performance test record structure; Specification §FR-2 and §PR-2 define OWS performance requirements supporting OBJ-7).
  - **Containment integrity test records**: Containment area identification, visual inspection for cracks/defects, hydrostatic testing or dye testing for liner/sealant integrity, leak detection, repair documentation, retest verification, acceptance sign-off (supports OBJ-7 Environmental Protection per Guidance §P-2; Procedure §6.4 describes containment integrity testing).
  - **Commissioning records**: System-level commissioning checklists integrating installation and test records, final acceptance sign-offs from D&B Contractor QA/QC and Employer's Representative, punch list items and resolutions, handover documentation (Specification §Scope lists "commissioning records"; Procedure §9 describes commissioning documentation and handover; Guidance §C-6 operations handover consideration).
- Record content is sourced from field test execution, calibration certificates, CCTV video files, survey field data, and validated against design deliverables (DEL-03.01/02/03/04) and Employer's Requirements; records consolidate information to demonstrate conformance and support commissioning handover (ASSUMPTION per typical installation record package purpose; see Specification §Scope record substantiation purpose and §IF-1 linkage to related deliverables; Procedure §2 describes collecting field data and design references).
- Testing acceptance criteria (pressure test durations and allowable pressure drop, flow rate tolerances, CCTV defect severity limits, OWS performance targets, survey accuracy standards) are documented in record sections to support QA/QC verification and regulatory compliance (DEL-03.06 CCTV Survey Report references acceptance criteria; see Specification §QR-3 testing acceptance criteria documentation; Procedure §4-7 testing execution steps document acceptance criteria application).
