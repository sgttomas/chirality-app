## Conditions

**Context & environmental expectations:**
- Defines the design arrangement and details for underground utilities that satisfy the Employer's Requirements in PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).
- Designed to support storm drainage, containment and conduit routing within Fraser Surrey Terminal per Scope Focus (Contractor scope only, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- Deliverable supports OBJ-7 Environmental Protection; drawings must capture spill containment and drainage controls (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Design life, temperature range, and seismic criteria follow the civil design brief and remain TBD until additional Employer's Requirements clauses are examined (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD).
- Coordinate with the Specification to ensure the drawing metadata and revision process mirror the requirements for documentation control (see Specification.md: Documentation section).

## Construction

**Materials & configuration focus:**
- Primary materials and configurations are documented in the drawing set (storm drainage, OWS, duct banks, trenchless crossings) as listed in the anticipated artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188 and Guidance.md: Purpose).
- Plans will present trench locations, pipe sizing callouts, and OWS layout guided by the principles outlined in Guidance.md and the required verification steps in Procedure.md.
- Construction and installation requirements follow the project Quality Management Plan and documented civil standards; details remain TBD pending Employer's Requirements and design development (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Cross-Document Points

- Specification → Requirements: The Drawing Set’s metadata entries must align with the specified document numbering, performance, and interface clauses so the project-controlled sheets implement the exact requirements (Specification.md: Requirements).
- Guidance → Considerations: The drainage, OWS, and duct bank representations in this Datasheet should reflect the principles and trade-offs captured in `Guidance.md`, especially for environmental protection details (Guidance.md: Principles, Trade-offs).
- Procedure → Steps/Verification: The workflow described in `Procedure.md` explains how the drawing outputs are checked, which lets Datasheet users know when approvals and QA verification happen before issuing to other deliverables.
