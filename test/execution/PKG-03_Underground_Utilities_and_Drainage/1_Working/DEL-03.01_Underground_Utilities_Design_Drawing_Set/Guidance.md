# Guidance: DEL-03.01 Underground Utilities Design Drawing Set

## Purpose
- Support the development of the underground utilities design drawings that set the arrangement and detailing for PKG-03 storm drainage, oil-water separator (OWS), duct bank, and trenchless crossing infrastructure (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).
- Provide interpretation so that the guidance complements the Specification and the Procedure by clarifying how drawing details tie to performance outcomes (Specification.md: Requirements).

## Principles
- Capture the hydraulic conveyance, containment controls, and sequencing logic that demonstrate compliance with the Employer's Requirements for civil utilities and direct the drawing team to produce the tables referenced in the Specification (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf; Specification.md: Performance Requirements).
- Maintain consistent notation, layer structure, and metadata so that the drawing set aligns with the project CAD standards and document control practices prior to being checked via Procedure.md (Procedure.md: Steps).
- Prioritize clarity around environmental protection features—drainage swales, sumps, and OWS instrumentation—because OBJ-7 specifically groups PKG-03 deliverables under that objective (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).

## Considerations
- Confirm design data from adjacent disciplines (earthworks, pavements, process piping) before finalizing trench alignments and elevations (Scope focus: contractor-only work, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- Incorporate regulatory requirements captured in the Employer's Requirements, particularly those affecting storm drainage, containment water collection, and trenchless crossings (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Structure sheets to clearly identify the anticipated artifacts listed in `_CONTEXT.md`—storm drainage plans, OWS layout, duct bank plans, trenchless crossings—to avoid scope creep and ensure the Procedure's verification steps capture each artifact (Procedure.md: Steps).
- Highlight the designated responsible party (D&B Contractor) and the need for QA/QC sign-offs to support future installation and test records.

## Trade-offs
- Balance detailing for constructability (detailed dimensions and sections) with clarity for future operations teams; avoid overloading drawings with unverified data (TBD until design maturity).
- Evaluate storm drainage capacity versus pipeline routing efficiency to satisfy both hydraulic performance and trench congestion (ASSUMPTION: general hydraulic/civil trade-off for underground utilities).
- Choose between detailed trenchless crossing representation and simpler alignment callouts; lean toward clarity for the duct bank schedule when multiple utilities converge, noting that these decisions feed into the Procedure's review checkpoints (Procedure.md: Verification).

## Examples
- Use the storm drainage and OWS layouts referenced in the anticipated artifacts list as the baseline for layering (Source: `_CONTEXT.md` and test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).
- Represent duct bank plans consistent with civil utility drawings used in previous packages, ensuring the notation follows the QA/QC conventions outlined in the project quality plan and expected in the Specification (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf; Specification.md: Quality Requirements).

## Cross-Document Notes

- Specification: The trade-offs and principles articulated here explain why the Specification mandates certain interface and performance requirements, helping reviewers connect intent with requirements (Specification.md: Performance Requirements).
- Datasheet: Drawings derived from this guidance should include the listed middleware details so the title blocks and attributes stay consistent (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Procedure: The verification steps rely on the narratives in this guidance to confirm the drawing set enforces environmental protection callouts before QA checks (Procedure.md: Steps).
