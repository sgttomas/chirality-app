# Procedure: DEL-03.01 Underground Utilities Design Drawing Set

## Purpose
- Produce and control the civil drawing deliverable that establishes the underground utilities arrangement, storm drainage infrastructure, OWS layout, duct banks, and trenchless crossings for PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are coordinated externally by humans (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`); confirm inputs from earthworks, pavements, and process teams before starting (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- **Reference materials:** Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2 (Civil & Process Mechanical Works) for civil utility expectations, project Quality Management Plan in Volume 2 Part 1, and package-level reference index (`execution/PKG-03_Underground_Utilities_and_Drainage/0_References/_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`).
- **Design intent:** Understand the Specification requirements and the Guidance principles so the drawing set documents the hydraulic, containment, and duct bank details clearly (Specification.md: Requirements; Guidance.md: Purpose).
- **Personnel requirements:** Civil discipline designer plus QA/QC checker per standard project procedures (ASSUMPTION: per Quality Management Plan in Volume 2 Part 1).

## Steps
1. Review scope and objectives documented in the decomposition, as well as the Specification sections that define required artifacts, confirming coverage of storm drainage, OWS layout, duct banks, and trenchless crossings for PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188; Specification.md: Scope).
2. Collect input data (survey, site grading, drainage calculations) from upstream packages and ensure the data is approved for design release.
3. Create schematic arrangements, then refine into detailed plans/profiles; align symbol usage and layering with the project CAD standard referenced by the Guidance (Guidance.md: Principles).
4. Annotate environmental protection features (containment sumps, OWS instrumentation) to support OBJ-7 compliance and to provide notation that the Specification expects in its Interface and Performance sections (Specification.md: Performance Requirements).
5. Perform self-checks, interdisciplinary checks, and independent checks to verify hydraulics and coordination before packaging for QA review; tie the Verification steps to the Datasheet's documentation metadata (Datasheet.md: References).
6. Compile revision history, issue control information, and deliver the drawing set into the document control system for the next lifecycle stage.

## Verification
- Self-check (originator review) ensures annotations, dimensions, and profiles match design inputs.
- Interdisciplinary check verifies coordination with earthworks, paving, process, and electrical disciplines (ASSUMPTION: typical engineer-review process, Quality Management Plan per test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Independent check confirms compliance with civil standards and Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 2); results recorded in review stamp blocks.
- Trace verification results in revision history fields so the Specification's verification methods can be referenced during future reviews (Specification.md: Verification).

## Records
- Storm drainage plans and profiles, OWS layout, duct bank plans, trenchless crossing drawings per `_CONTEXT.md` anticipated artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).
- Drawing review logs, issue registers, QA checklists, and discipline review records are retained per the project document control procedures (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Follow the metadata and attribute expectations listed there so the Procedure’s verification steps can point to finalized document numbers and revisions (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Specification: Verification activities demonstrate compliance with the requirements defined in the Specification, ensuring QA sign-offs close the loop on each clause (Specification.md: Verification).
- Guidance: The Principles/Considerations sections describe why each step exists, giving the Procedure context for focusing on environmental protection and coordination (Guidance.md: Considerations, Trade-offs).
