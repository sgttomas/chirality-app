# Specification: DEL-03.01 Underground Utilities Design Drawing Set

## Scope
This specification governs the development of the **Underground Utilities Design Drawing Set** for **PKG-03 Underground Utilities & Drainage**. The set defines the design arrangement and details for storm drainage, containment, duct banks, and trenchless crossings per the Employer's Requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).

**Anticipated artifacts within this scope:**
- Storm drainage plans and profiles
- OWS layout
- Duct bank plans
- Trenchless crossing drawings

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide comprehensive plans/profiles for storm drainage, OWS, duct bank routing, and trenchless crossings to demonstrate the underground utilities arrangement described in the decomposition (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).
- Capture oil-water separator layout and containment details to support the environmental protection focus for PKG-03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786).
- Represent coordination requirements across underground networks so civil disciplines and QA/QC can verify constructability before installation begins (Dependencies: NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).
- Ensure drawing metadata (numbering, revision, sheet sizes) aligns with the Datasheet and the project document control expectations (Datasheet.md: Attributes).

### Performance Requirements
- Conform to the hydraulic, structural, and drainage performance expectations described in the Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2: Civil & Process Mechanical Works (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, specific clauses TBD).
- Ensure drawings support the permitted throughput, storage, and containment expectations for Phase 1 as described in the decomposition's project overview parameters (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md, Project Overview section).

### Interface Requirements
- Coordinate layout information with adjacent packages (PKG-02 site grading, PKG-04 paving, etc.) through existing project coordination workflows (Scope focus: Contractor scope only, Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- Dependencies are coordinated externally (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`); updates must reflect what other disciplines require from this drawing set.
- Link drawing callouts to material/performance requirements documented in the Technical Specification (DEL-03.02) and Data Sheet Package (DEL-03.04) to keep installations traceable.

### Quality Requirements
- Deliverables shall comply with the project Quality Management Plan and document control expectations captured in Volume 2 Part 1: Employer's Requirements – General Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, details TBD).
- Drawings shall be internally reviewed by originators and checked per QA/QC processes before issue (ASSUMPTION per Procedure.md: Verification) with documented checklists.

## Standards
- Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2: Civil & Process Mechanical Works is the authoritative source for applicable civil standards and product selections; specific clauses will populate as design details mature (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Supplementary standards (e.g., CAD discipline standards, QA/QC requirements) will be drawn from the project Quality Management Plan and referenced drawing standards once documented (sources: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, _REFERENCES). 

## Verification
- Design reviews (originator/self-check, interdisciplinary check, independent check) validate compliance with functional requirements, as described in the Procedure section and consistent with the Quality Management Plan (Source: Procedure.md: Verification, test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Dimensional verification (scale, coordinates, elevations) confirms that profiles in this drawing set align with site constraints; results recorded in drawing review records (specific procedures TBD).
- Verify that drawing annotations reference the Data Sheet Package and Specification deliverables for performance requirements.

## Documentation
- Documented artifacts: storm drainage plans and profiles, OWS layout, duct bank plans, trenchless crossing drawings (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:188).
- Format, numbering, and revision requirements follow the project document control procedures (Volume 2 Part 1); details (e.g., numbering scheme) remain TBD until the document control register is defined.
- Ensure metadata (issue status, revision history) is maintained within each drawing sheet set prior to issuing for review.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Coordinates metadata details so drawing title blocks reflect the Specification’s document control requirements (Datasheet.md: Attributes).
- Guidance: Amplifies how the Specification’s requirements manifest visually—e.g., environmental protection callouts for drainage/OWS align with the Principles section (Guidance.md: Purpose, Considerations).
- Procedure: Documentation of the verification steps clarifies when the listed requirements in this specification have been checked, enabling traceability back to the Datasheet (Procedure.md: Verification).
