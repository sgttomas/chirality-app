# Guidance: DEL-07.04 Rail Works Installation & Test Records

**Enrichment Status:** Pass 3 Complete (3-pass enrichment: Initial draft, Cross-reference enrichment, Final reconciliation)

## Purpose
- Guide capture of installation and test evidence for PKG-07 rail works so that track alignment surveys, ballast tests, and rail weld inspections are documented in a traceable way (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Ensure record packages support contractual compliance and quality assurance expectations (clauses TBD) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Principles
- Treat each record as part of a traceable chain linking the installed work to drawings (DEL-07.01), specification requirements (DEL-07.02), and calculation basis (DEL-07.03) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-268).
- Record what was actually observed/measured and avoid interpreting beyond evidence; any deviations should be logged with disposition/approval path (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Maintain consistent location referencing so surveys/tests/inspections can be tied back to drawing identifiers and limits of work (TBD until drawing numbering is defined).

## Considerations
- Ensure the records reflect the rail works scope boundaries (Tracks 6 & 7 new works; Track 5 modifications; ballast; end stops) so unrelated records are not mixed into the deliverable (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259).
- Dependencies are coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Record any interface assumptions (e.g., access constraints) as **TBD/ASSUMPTION** and coordinate via the project process (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- Acceptance criteria and test methods are **TBD** until extracted from Employer’s Requirements and DEL-07.02; avoid inserting unsourced tolerances (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).

## Trade-offs
- Level of detail vs field burden: capture enough detail for auditability without overburdening field teams; the required level is **TBD** until ER quality clauses are extracted (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Digital vs manual recording: choose approach based on site constraints and document control expectations (TBD).

## Examples (from anticipated artifacts)
- Track alignment survey record package (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Ballast test record package with sample IDs, methods, results, and sign-offs (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268; acceptance criteria TBD).
- Rail weld inspection record package (visual/NDT as applicable; details TBD) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).

## Cross-Document Notes
- Datasheet: Datasheet.md defines coverage and storage metadata for the record package.
- Specification: Specification.md defines what the record package must contain and how traceability is achieved.
- Procedure: Procedure.md provides the workflow sequence for collecting, checking, and compiling records prior to issue.
