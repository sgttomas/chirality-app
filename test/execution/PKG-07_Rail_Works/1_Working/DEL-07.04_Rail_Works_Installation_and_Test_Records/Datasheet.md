## Conditions

- Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for PKG-07 rail works (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Rail works scope includes new rail tracks (6 & 7), ballast, end stops, and Track 5 restoration/modifications (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259).
- Record content and acceptance criteria are **TBD** pending extraction from Employer’s Requirements and the rail works technical specification deliverable (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf; test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD; and test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).

## Coverage (Anticipated Artifacts)

Minimum anticipated records (per decomposition):
- Track alignment survey (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Ballast test records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Rail weld inspection records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).

- Guidance.md — provides recordkeeping principles and trade-offs (level of detail, defect reporting).
- Procedure.md — defines field workflow and verification steps for compiling the records package.

## Cross-Document Points

- Technical Specification (DEL-07.02): Record content and acceptance criteria must align to inspection/testing requirements defined in DEL-07.02 (TBD until ER clauses are extracted) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266, :268).
- Design Calculations (DEL-07.03): Where alignment/geometry acceptance depends on calculated criteria, reference DEL-07.03 basis (TBD) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267-268).
- Procedure → Evidence: Procedure.md defines the evidence set expected alongside the records package (checklists, NCR/deviation logs, transmittals) (Source: Procedure.md: Records).
