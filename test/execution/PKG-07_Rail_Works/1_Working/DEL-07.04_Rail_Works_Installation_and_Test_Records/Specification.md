# Specification: DEL-07.04 Rail Works Installation & Test Records

**Enrichment Status:** Pass 3 Complete (3-pass enrichment: Initial draft, Cross-reference enrichment, Final reconciliation)

## Scope
Documents the evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for PKG-07 rail works (new tracks 6 & 7, ballast, end stops, Track 5 restoration/modifications) as required by the decomposition scope and Employer’s Requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259, :268).

**Anticipated record artifacts within this deliverable (per decomposition):**
- Track alignment survey (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Ballast test records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Rail weld inspection records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Capture records that demonstrate the rail works installation/testing activities were completed and checked against the applicable requirements and acceptance criteria (acceptance criteria **TBD** until extracted from ER and DEL-07.02) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266, :268).
- Each record shall include identification (location, date, responsible inspector), method/procedure used, results, pass/fail against acceptance criteria, and required sign-offs (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Log deviations/nonconformances with corrective actions and approvals so reviewers can confirm resolutions prior to issue (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

### Performance Requirements
- Testing/inspection requirements and acceptance criteria are **TBD** pending extraction from Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 2 and the rail works technical specification deliverable (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).

### Interface Requirements
- Reference the correct drawing/spec identifiers so field observations can be traced to DEL-07.01 (drawings), DEL-07.02 (spec), and DEL-07.03 (calculations) where applicable (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- Dependencies are coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Any interface assumptions required to complete testing must be documented and coordinated via the project process (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).

### Quality Requirements
- Records follow the Quality Management Plan / document control expectations in Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 1 (clauses TBD), including sign-offs, reviewer initials, and storage instructions (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
- Records should include traceability to the verification expectations in DEL-07.02 and any calculation basis in DEL-07.03 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266-267).

## Standards
- Applicable inspection/testing standards for rail works are **TBD** pending extraction from Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 2 and any referenced standards therein (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Document control requirements are **TBD** pending Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 1 extraction (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Verification
- Completeness check against anticipated records list (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Data integrity check (dates, locations, sign-offs) per document control expectations (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Traceability check to drawings/spec/calcs identifiers (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- Verification activities are executed and evidenced via the workflow in Procedure.md (Source: Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).

Acceptance criteria:
- **TBD** — will be stated once ER clauses and quality procedures are identified.

## Verification-to-Records Mapping

| Verification item | Evidence / record produced (examples) | Where defined |
|---|---|---|
| Completeness check | Record package index covering survey/test/inspection artifacts | Procedure.md: Steps, Records |
| Data integrity check | Completed checklists, sign-offs, calibration/traceability attachments (TBD as ER clauses are extracted) | Procedure.md: Steps, Records |
| Traceability check | References to DEL-07.01/02/03 identifiers within records | Procedure.md: Steps, Verification |
| NCR handling | Nonconformance/deviation logs and dispositions (if any) | Procedure.md: Steps, Records |

## Documentation
- Records include track alignment survey, ballast test records, and rail weld inspection records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Archive records in the document control system and reference them during downstream reviews/commissioning as applicable (TBD).

## Cross-Document Notes
- Datasheet: Datasheet.md captures coverage and storage metadata; keep it aligned with record types and document control requirements.
- Guidance: Guidance.md provides how-to for traceability and level-of-detail decisions in record capture.
- Procedure: Procedure.md provides the stepwise workflow for collecting, checking, and compiling the records package.
