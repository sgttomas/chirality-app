# Procedure: DEL-07.04 Rail Works Installation & Test Records

**Enrichment Status:** Pass 3 Complete (3-pass enrichment: Initial draft, Cross-reference enrichment, Final reconciliation)

## Purpose
- Define how rail works installation/test evidence is collected, checked, compiled, and retained for PKG-07 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm the applicable drawing/spec versions to reference (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-266).
- **Reference materials:** Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 1 (quality/document control) and Vol 2 Pt 2 (rail/civil testing clauses) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf; test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- **Scope alignment:** Confirm record coverage matches the anticipated artifacts for DEL-07.04 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).

## Steps
1. Identify required records and templates/checklists based on the anticipated artifacts list and applicable ER clauses (clauses TBD) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268; test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf).
2. Collect field evidence:
   - Track alignment survey results (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
   - Ballast test results (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
   - Rail weld inspection results (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
3. Verify completeness and integrity (required fields, locations, dates, inspector names/sign-offs, pass/fail criteria) per project quality/document control requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
4. Log any deviations/nonconformances discovered during verification, including disposition/corrective actions and approvals, and ensure the record package includes the final status (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
5. Compile records into an issuance-ready package, referencing the correct drawing/spec/calculation identifiers where applicable (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
6. Issue/store records through document control with revision history and approvals per Employer’s Requirements (clauses TBD) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf).

## Verification
- Completeness check against anticipated artifacts list (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Traceability check to the governing specification/calculation/drawing identifiers (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- Document control compliance check (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Records
- Track alignment survey, ballast test records, rail weld inspection records, completed checklists, nonconformance/deviation logs (if any), and issue transmittals retained per document control requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268; test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
