# Procedure: DEL-07.02 Rail Works Technical Specification

**Enrichment Status:** Pass 3 Complete (3-pass enrichment: Initial draft, Cross-reference enrichment, Final reconciliation)

## Purpose
- Establish the process for drafting, reviewing, and controlling the rail works technical specification that governs PKG-07 rail works performance/material/workmanship requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259, :266).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm inputs needed from drawings (DEL-07.01) and calculations (DEL-07.03) before finalizing requirements (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265, :267).
- **Reference materials:** Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 1 (general/document control/QA) and Vol 2 Pt 2 (civil/rail works technical clauses) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf; test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Steps
1. Confirm scope statements and anticipated artifacts list for DEL-07.02 (rail, ballast, track construction specification sections) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).
2. Extract applicable requirements from Employer’s Requirements and translate into structured “shall” statements; record any missing requirements as **TBD** with placeholders for clause references (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
3. Draft specification sections:
   - Rail specification (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).
   - Ballast specification (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).
   - Track construction specification (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).
4. Add verification and records requirements for each section so QA/QC can produce DEL-07.04 installation/test records (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
5. Build a requirements traceability / compliance matrix linking each requirement to its source clause (or explicitly to **ASSUMPTION/PROPOSAL**) and to its verification/record output (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD; and DEL-07.04 intent in test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
6. Perform internal technical review and interface review (via external coordination) and resolve comments, documenting decisions and any unresolved **TBD** items (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
7. Issue through document control per Employer’s Requirements (revision history, approvals, distribution) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Verification
- Completeness check against anticipated artifacts list (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266).
- Traceability check: each requirement links to an ER clause or is labeled **ASSUMPTION/PROPOSAL** (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Records linkage check: verification methods and required records align with DEL-07.04 intent (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:268).
- Document control compliance check (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Records
- Draft and final specification documents, requirements traceability/compliance matrix, review comment logs/responses, and approval/issue records retained per project document control expectations (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
