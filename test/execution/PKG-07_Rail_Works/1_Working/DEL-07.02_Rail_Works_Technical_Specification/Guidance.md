# Guidance: DEL-07.02 Rail Works Technical Specification

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Rail Works Technical Specification** for **PKG-07 Rail Works**.

Defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for rail works per ER requirements.

This deliverable is classified as a **Specification** under the **Structural** discipline, to be produced by **D&B Contractor**.

## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Structural discipline):**

- **TBD** — Governing engineering principles to be articulated during design development
- **ASSUMPTION**: Design shall follow good engineering practice per applicable codes and Employer's Requirements
- **TBD** — Discipline-specific design philosophy to be confirmed

**Applicable standards context:**
- CSA S16
- CSA A23.3
- CSA S136
- NBC 2020

## Considerations

**Factors to consider during development:**

- Package scope: PKG-07 Rail Works
- Deliverable type: Specification — consider type-specific requirements and conventions
- Coordination with adjacent packages — see `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (NOT_TRACKED)
- Employer's Requirements — review for project-specific constraints
- Regulatory requirements — **TBD**
- Constructability — **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**: To be considered during design development
- Operability and maintainability — **TBD**

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

- **TBD** — Cost vs. performance trade-offs
- **TBD** — Schedule vs. quality considerations
- **TBD** — Standardization vs. optimization
- **TBD** — Design conservatism vs. material efficiency
- **ASSUMPTION**: Trade-off decisions to be documented in design rationale records

## Examples

**Reference examples and precedents:**

- Refer to Employer's Requirements for project-specific expectations
- **TBD** — Industry precedent and best practice examples
- **TBD** — Lessons learned from similar facilities
- Anticipated artifacts for reference:
- Rail specification
- ballast specification
- track construction specification
