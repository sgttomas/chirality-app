# Procedure: DEL-07.03 Rail Works Design Calculations

**Enrichment Status:** Pass 3 Complete (3-pass enrichment: Initial draft, Cross-reference enrichment, Final reconciliation)

## Purpose
- Define the process for developing, checking, and documenting the rail works calculations that underpin PKG-07 rail works (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259, :267).

## Prerequisites
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`). Confirm required inputs (survey/as-built track info, interface constraints) before finalizing calculations (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).
- **Reference materials:** Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 2 for rail/civil works technical clauses and Vol 2 Pt 1 for calculation control/document control expectations (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf; test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- **Scope alignment:** Confirm that the calculation package covers the anticipated artifacts (track geometry calculations and ballast depth calculations) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).

## Steps
1. Review the decomposition entry and `_CONTEXT.md` to confirm scope boundaries and anticipated calculation artifacts (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259, :267).
2. Assemble input data (survey/base data, existing track information, design constraints) and document sources. Record missing data as **TBD**.
3. Develop track geometry calculations; document assumptions, inputs, and outputs with units and references (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).
4. Develop ballast depth calculations; document methodology and criteria (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).
5. Build a calculation check package (inputs list, assumptions register, units/QA checklist, reviewer comments/responses) so the verification evidence is explicit (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
6. Perform peer/independent check and resolve comments; ensure consistency with DEL-07.02 requirements and DEL-07.01 drawing assumptions (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
7. Issue through document control with revision history and approvals (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Verification
- Peer/independent check of calculation logic, inputs, and units (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Traceability check to ER clauses (or explicit **ASSUMPTION/PROPOSAL** tagging) (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Consistency check versus DEL-07.01 drawings and DEL-07.02 specification (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).

## Records
- Calculation reports, input/output tables, model files (if applicable), assumptions register, and review checklists/comments retained per the project quality/document control requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
