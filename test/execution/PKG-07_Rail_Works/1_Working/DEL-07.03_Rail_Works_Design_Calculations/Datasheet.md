## Conditions

- Rail works scope includes new rail tracks (6 & 7), ballast, end stops, and Track 5 restoration/modifications (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259).
- This deliverable provides the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for PKG-07 rail works (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).
- Interfaces reflect “Contractor scope only” with Employer-responsible items excluded except for interface connections (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).

## Outputs (Anticipated Artifacts)

Minimum anticipated calculation artifacts (per decomposition):
- Track geometry calculations (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).
- Ballast depth calculations (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).

- Procedure.md — defines the calculation development, checking, and records workflow.

## Cross-Document Notes

- Technical Specification (DEL-07.02): Calculation assumptions and outputs should be traceable to the performance/material/workmanship requirements where applicable (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:266-267).
- Drawing Set (DEL-07.01): Drawing callouts/notes should align with calculation basis (geometry, ballast) (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265, :267).
- ITRs (DEL-07.04): Calculations should inform what must be checked/verified in records (e.g., alignment acceptance) once ER criteria are known (TBD).
- Procedure → Evidence: Procedure.md defines the calculation check package expected alongside the calculation outputs (inputs list, assumptions register, QA checklist, reviewer comments) (Source: Procedure.md: Steps, Records).
