# Specification: DEL-07.03 Rail Works Design Calculations

**Enrichment Status:** Pass 3 Complete (3-pass enrichment: Initial draft, Cross-reference enrichment, Final reconciliation)

## Scope
Defines the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for PKG-07 rail works, which includes new rail tracks (6 & 7), ballast, end stops, and Track 5 restoration/modifications (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:259, :267).

**Anticipated calculation artifacts within this deliverable (per decomposition):**
- Track geometry calculations (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).
- Ballast depth calculations (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide track geometry calculations sufficient to substantiate the rail works arrangement shown in DEL-07.01 drawings and to support performance criteria defined in DEL-07.02 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- Provide ballast depth calculations sufficient to substantiate ballast section details shown in DEL-07.01 drawings and requirements defined in DEL-07.02 (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- State all assumptions, inputs, and sources; where inputs are not available, mark as **TBD** and do not silently assume values.

### Performance Requirements
- Performance criteria/tolerances that govern track geometry and ballast depth are **TBD** pending extraction from the Employer’s Requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

### Interface Requirements
- Coordinate calculation assumptions with DEL-07.01 (Drawing Set) and DEL-07.02 (Technical Specification) so downstream deliverables reflect consistent criteria and terminology (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- Dependencies are coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED; see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`); interface inputs are **TBD** until confirmed via the project coordination process (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:47).

### Quality Requirements
- Calculation packages must include input summaries, methodology, units, assumptions, and check records consistent with the project Quality Management Plan / general requirements (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Include documented peer/independent check evidence prior to issue.

## Standards
- Applicable calculation/design standards for rail works are **TBD** pending extraction from Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 2 and any referenced standards therein (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Document control requirements are **TBD** pending Employer’s Requirements Vol 2 Pt 1 extraction (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Verification
- Peer check / independent check of calculation logic, units, and inputs (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).
- Consistency check versus DEL-07.02 requirements and DEL-07.01 drawing assumptions (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:265-267).
- Verification activities are executed and evidenced via the workflow in Procedure.md (Source: Procedure.md: Steps, Verification).

Acceptance criteria:
- **TBD** — will be stated once ER clauses and quality procedures are identified.

## Verification-to-Records Mapping

| Verification item | Evidence / record produced (examples) | Where defined |
|---|---|---|
| Peer/independent check | Calculation check package (inputs list, assumptions register, units/QA checklist, reviewer comments/responses) | Procedure.md: Steps, Records |
| ER traceability check | Assumptions register with ER clause placeholders and **ASSUMPTION/PROPOSAL** tags | Procedure.md: Steps, Verification |
| Consistency check | Cross-check notes versus DEL-07.02 and DEL-07.01 assumptions | Procedure.md: Steps, Verification |

## Documentation
- Required outputs: track geometry calculations and ballast depth calculations (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:267).
- Maintain revision history, approvals, and distribution records per project document control standards (Source: test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, clauses TBD).

## Cross-Document Notes

- Datasheet: Datasheet.md captures the calculation package scope and metadata fields to align with document control rules once identified.
- Guidance: Guidance.md provides how-to for handling assumptions and traceability to ER clauses.
- Procedure: Procedure.md defines the calculation development/review workflow and the records retained.
