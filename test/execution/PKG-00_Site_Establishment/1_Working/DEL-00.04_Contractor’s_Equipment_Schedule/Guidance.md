# Guidance: DEL-00.04 Contractor’s Equipment Schedule

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Contractor’s Equipment Schedule, which provides project management/control documentation for contractor’s equipment schedule required by the Employer's Requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.04)

## Principles

- **Scope alignment:** The equipment schedule should reflect the site establishment scope (temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, and traffic management). (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope)
- **Terminal continuity objective (best-effort mapping):** This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity, whose objective is to minimize disturbance to existing terminal commercial activities. Treat this as contextual guidance until confirmed by the human. (Source: decomposition Section 2, OBJ-5 description; Section 6 objective mapping)
- **Contractor scope boundary:** Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections; the schedule should avoid assuming Employer-furnished scope unless interfaces are explicitly required. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2)

## Considerations

- Ensure the schedule aligns with anticipated artifacts (construction equipment list, mobilization/demobilization schedule). (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.04)
- Employer's Requirements are listed as reference documents but are not yet available in this deliverable's references; requirements should be treated as **TBD** until provided. (Source: decomposition Section 3; `_REFERENCES.md`)
- Dependencies are coordinated externally in NOT_TRACKED mode; confirm required inputs with the human or coordination process. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; `_COORDINATION.md`)

## Trade-offs

- **TBD** — Trade-offs are not identified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Examples

**Anticipated artifacts (examples of schedule outputs):**

- Construction equipment list
- Mobilization/demobilization schedule
