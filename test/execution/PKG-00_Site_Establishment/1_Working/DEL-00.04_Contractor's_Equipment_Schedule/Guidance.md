# Guidance: DEL-00.04 Contractor's Equipment Schedule

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Contractor's Equipment Schedule, which provides project management/control documentation for contractor's equipment schedule required by the Employer's Requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144)

This deliverable provides visibility and control over construction equipment resources, supporting project planning and coordination with terminal operations. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Purpose section)

## Principles

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Equipment scheduling implications:**
- Large equipment mobilization should avoid peak terminal operational periods
- Equipment routing and positioning should minimize interference with terminal traffic
- Schedule should allow flexibility to adjust equipment movements based on terminal operational needs
- Advance notice of major equipment deliveries should be coordinated with terminal operations

(ASSUMPTION: Typical considerations for equipment management at operating terminals.)

### Accuracy and currency

Equipment documentation should accurately reflect planned and actual equipment deployment. Update regularly as project conditions change. (ASSUMPTION: Standard project management practice)

### Coordination with project schedule

Equipment mobilization/demobilization timing should align with construction schedule needs and site readiness. (ASSUMPTION: Standard project management practice)

## Considerations

### Equipment list content

**Construction equipment list** — Consider including:
- Major equipment (cranes, excavators, pile drivers, concrete pumps, welding machines)
- Capacity/rating (lift capacity, bucket size, pump rate)
- Quantity on site at any given time
- Ownership (contractor-owned, rented, subcontractor-furnished)
- Mobilization and demobilization dates
- Primary usage areas or work packages
- Certification and inspection status

(Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

### Schedule development

**Mobilization/demobilization schedule** — Consider:
- Align equipment arrival with construction readiness (site prep, laydown space, utilities)
- Sequence equipment to match work progression
- Coordinate large/heavy equipment deliveries with site access constraints
- Plan demobilization to avoid congestion at project closeout
- Include contingency for equipment breakdowns or delays
- Coordinate with terminal operations to schedule deliveries during low-activity periods (OBJ-5)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Content Requirements section)

### Reference materials

- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements and project management plan requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Dependencies and coordination

- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for equipment laydown locations and access routing
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for mobilization procedures and traffic management
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with overall project schedule for construction phasing and milestones

## Trade-offs

### Detail level: comprehensive vs. major equipment only

**Consideration:** Listing all equipment (including small tools) provides complete visibility but increases documentation burden. Listing only major equipment reduces effort but may miss important coordination needs.

**Guidance:** Focus on major equipment that requires significant space, special handling, advance planning, or coordination with terminal operations. Minor tools and equipment can be managed at subcontractor level without project-level tracking.

### Update frequency: real-time vs. periodic

**Consideration:** Real-time updates provide current information but require continuous effort. Periodic updates (weekly, monthly) reduce burden but information may lag actual conditions.

**Guidance:** Balance update frequency with project needs and Employer requirements. For active mobilization/demobilization phases, more frequent updates may be warranted. During steady-state construction, less frequent updates may suffice.

**TBD** — Specific update frequency requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements.

### Typical content (ASSUMPTION)

**Equipment list example entries:**
- Tower crane, 50-ton capacity, Qty 1, Rented, Mob: Week 4, Demob: Week 52, Usage: Structural steel erection
- Excavator, 1 cu.yd bucket, Qty 2, Owned, Mob: Week 1, Demob: Week 20, Usage: Earthworks
- Concrete pump, 100 cu.yd/hr, Qty 1, Subcontractor, Mob: Week 12, Demob: Week 30, Usage: Concrete placement

**Schedule example milestones:**
- Week 1: Site access established, excavators mobilize
- Week 4: Tower crane mobilize and erect
- Week 12: Concrete pump mobilize
- Week 20: Earthworks complete, excavators demobilize
- Week 52: Project substantial completion, tower crane dismantle and demobilize
