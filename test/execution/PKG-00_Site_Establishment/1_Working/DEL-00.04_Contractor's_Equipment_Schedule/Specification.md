# Specification: DEL-00.04 Contractor's Equipment Schedule

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for the Contractor's Equipment Schedule deliverable within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144)

**Deliverable purpose:** Provide project management/control documentation for contractor's equipment schedule required by the Employer's Requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The equipment schedule documentation shall include the following artifacts (minimum 2 documents):

1. **Construction equipment list** — Comprehensive register of major construction equipment planned for use on project, including equipment type, capacity/rating, quantity, ownership (owned/rented), mobilization date, demobilization date, and anticipated usage areas

2. **Mobilization/demobilization schedule** — Timeline showing when equipment will be mobilized to site and demobilized from site, coordinated with construction schedule milestones and phasing to support orderly execution

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144.

ASSUMPTION: Document scope interpretation based on typical EPC project management documentation requirements. Specific content and format to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section)

### Content Requirements

**Construction equipment list shall include (ASSUMPTION):**
- Equipment identification (type, model, capacity)
- Equipment quantity and ownership status
- Mobilization and demobilization dates
- Anticipated usage areas/work packages
- Equipment certifications and inspections required

**Mobilization/demobilization schedule shall include (ASSUMPTION):**
- Timeline with key milestones
- Equipment mobilization sequence
- Equipment demobilization sequence
- Coordination with construction schedule phases
- Interface with site access and laydown planning

**TBD — Employer's Requirements content:**
- Specific equipment list fields, schedule format, and reporting requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`; decomposition Section 3, lines 75–79)

### Coordination Requirements

**OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity coordination:**
- Equipment mobilization/demobilization schedule shall coordinate with terminal operational constraints to minimize disruption. (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63)
- Large equipment deliveries and movements shall be scheduled to avoid peak terminal operational periods. (ASSUMPTION: Required to support OBJ-5)

**Interface with other deliverables:**
- ASSUMPTION: Equipment schedule interfaces with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for equipment laydown locations, and DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for mobilization procedures. Coordination to be confirmed during working sessions. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section; Procedure.md Prerequisites section)

### Quality Requirements

- Equipment list shall be accurate, complete, and maintained current throughout project execution. (ASSUMPTION: Standard project management practice)
- Schedule shall be realistic and coordinated with overall project schedule. (ASSUMPTION: Standard project management practice)
- **TBD** — Specific update frequency, approval requirements, and change control procedures not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable standards:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1) listed in decomposition but not yet available. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable requirements may include project management plan standards, scheduling software requirements, and reporting formats.

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- Both documents listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Verification section)

**Coordination check:**
- Equipment schedule shall be coordinated with construction schedule, site layout, and mobilization procedures. (Cross-reference: Procedure.md Verification section)

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs:**

1. Construction equipment list
2. Mobilization/demobilization schedule

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Procedure.md Records section; Guidance.md Examples section)

**Documentation control:**
- **TBD** — Document control, revision management, and distribution requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
