## Conditions

**Project and scope context:**

- Temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, traffic management. (Source: `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Deliverable intent:**

- Provide project management/control documentation for contractor's equipment schedule required by the Employer's Requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144)

**Operational context:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- Equipment scheduling shall support minimizing disruption to existing terminal commercial operations (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

## Construction

**Anticipated document artifacts:**

- Construction equipment list
- Mobilization/demobilization schedule

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.04, line 144.

**Document content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Construction equipment list:** Comprehensive register of major construction equipment planned for use on project, including equipment type, capacity/rating, quantity, ownership (owned/rented), mobilization date, demobilization date, and anticipated usage areas
- **Mobilization/demobilization schedule:** Timeline showing when equipment will be mobilized to site and demobilized from site, coordinated with construction schedule milestones and phasing to support orderly execution

(ASSUMPTION: Typical equipment documentation for EPC projects. Specific content and format requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)
