# Procedure: DEL-00.04 Contractor's Equipment Schedule

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Contractor's Equipment Schedule deliverable (minimum 2 documents) for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section)

This procedure covers development, maintenance, and reporting of equipment documentation to support project management and coordination with terminal operations. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Guidance.md Purpose section)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

NOT_TRACKED. Dependencies are coordinated externally by humans. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Likely prerequisite deliverables and inputs include:
- Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements)
- Project construction schedule and phasing plan
- DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for equipment laydown locations
- DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for mobilization procedures
- Equipment rental contracts and subcontractor equipment lists

### Reference materials

**Required inputs:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Project management plan and schedule not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Equipment specifications and rental agreements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Steps

### 1. Collect equipment information

**Action:** Gather equipment data from construction planning, subcontractors, and rental suppliers.

**Sub-steps:**
1.1. Identify major equipment required for each work package based on construction methods and schedule
1.2. Obtain equipment specifications (type, model, capacity) from subcontractors and suppliers
1.3. Determine equipment quantities needed based on production rates and schedule
1.4. Identify equipment ownership (contractor-owned, rented, subcontractor-furnished)
1.5. Coordinate with procurement to confirm equipment availability and lead times

(ASSUMPTION: Equipment data collection workflow. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section)

### 2. Develop construction equipment list

**Action:** Compile equipment information into comprehensive register.

**Sub-steps:**
2.1. Set up equipment list format (table or database) per project standards. (**TBD** — format not specified)
2.2. Populate equipment list with identification, capacity, quantity, ownership
2.3. Assign anticipated usage areas or work packages to each equipment item
2.4. Include certification and inspection requirements per equipment type
2.5. Review for completeness and accuracy

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Content Requirements section; Guidance.md Equipment list content)

### 3. Develop mobilization/demobilization schedule

**Action:** Create timeline for equipment mobilization and demobilization.

**Sub-steps:**
3.1. Obtain project construction schedule and key milestones
3.2. Determine mobilization dates based on site readiness and work package start dates
3.3. Determine demobilization dates based on work package completion and subsequent equipment needs
3.4. Sequence equipment to match work progression
3.5. Coordinate large equipment deliveries with terminal operations to minimize disruption (OBJ-5)
3.6. Populate schedule format (Gantt chart or table) showing equipment timeline
3.7. Review for coordination with construction schedule and site constraints

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Content Requirements section; Guidance.md Schedule development; Guidance.md Trade-offs)

### 4. Coordinate with stakeholders

**Action:** Review equipment schedule with stakeholders and incorporate feedback.

**Sub-steps:**
4.1. Coordinate with DEL-00.01 team to confirm equipment laydown locations and space availability
4.2. Coordinate with DEL-00.03 team to align with mobilization procedures and traffic management
4.3. Coordinate with Employer/terminal operations to confirm equipment delivery windows and constraints (**TBD** — coordination process not defined)
4.4. Update equipment list and schedule based on coordination feedback

(Cross-reference: Guidance.md Dependencies and coordination)

### 5. Issue equipment schedule documentation

**Action:** Submit equipment schedule per project document control process.

**Sub-steps:**
5.1. Prepare transmittal package (**TBD** — transmittal format not specified)
5.2. Submit to project document control system (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
5.3. Distribute to Employer and project stakeholders

### 6. Maintain and update equipment schedule

**Action:** Keep equipment documentation current throughout project execution.

**Sub-steps:**
6.1. Monitor equipment mobilization/demobilization activities and compare to schedule
6.2. Update equipment list as equipment is added, removed, or modified
6.3. Update schedule dates based on actual mobilization/demobilization or revised construction schedule
6.4. Issue updated documentation per agreed frequency (**TBD** — update frequency not specified)
6.5. Track and report variances from planned equipment deployment

(Cross-reference: Guidance.md Trade-offs for update frequency)

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- Confirm construction equipment list and mobilization/demobilization schedule have been produced. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

**Accuracy check:**
- Verify equipment information is accurate and current
- Verify schedule dates align with construction schedule

**Coordination check:**
- Verify coordination with site layout, mobilization procedures, and terminal operational constraints (OBJ-5)
