## Conditions

**Project and scope context:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Deliverable intent:**

- Defines the design arrangement and details for temporary water supply installation details per ER requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148)

**Operational context:**

- Temporary water supply shall support construction activities while minimizing disruption to existing terminal operations (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)
- **TBD** — Water demand, source availability, connection points, and regulatory requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated drawing contents (expected artifacts):**

- Temporary water service routing
- Connection details
- Backflow prevention details

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148.

**Drawing content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Temporary water service routing:** Plan and profile showing temporary water pipe routing from connection point (existing water service or hydrant) to site distribution points (office trailers, welfare facilities, construction areas), including pipe sizing, materials, and layout
- **Connection details:** Detailed drawings showing connection to existing water supply, including tapping method, valve installation, meter installation (if required), and temporary vs. permanent connection interface
- **Backflow prevention details:** Detailed drawings showing backflow preventer installation, including device type/size, installation configuration, testing provisions, and compliance with plumbing codes

(ASSUMPTION: Typical temporary water supply drawing content for construction sites. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and applicable codes once available.)
