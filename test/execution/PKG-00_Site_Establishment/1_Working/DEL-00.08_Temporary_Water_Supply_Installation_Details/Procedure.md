## Steps

### 1. Collect design inputs

**Action:** Gather design information for temporary water supply.

**Sub-steps:**
1.1. Obtain DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) to identify temporary facility locations and water demand points
1.2. Obtain existing water system drawings showing available connection points, pipe sizes, and system capacity
1.3. Obtain water utility provider requirements and connection procedures
1.4. Obtain applicable plumbing codes and backflow prevention requirements
1.5. Determine water demand (potable, fire protection, construction uses) (**TBD** — demand calculation methodology not specified)
1.6. Identify connection point and verify capacity/pressure adequacy
1.7. Identify missing inputs and mark as **TBD**

(ASSUMPTION: Design input collection workflow. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section)

### 2. Develop temporary water service routing design

**Action:** Design pipe routing from connection point to distribution points.

**Sub-steps:**
2.1. Establish routing from connection point to distribution points (coordinate with site layout per DEL-00.01)
2.2. Size pipes based on water demand and code requirements (**TBD** — sizing criteria not specified)
2.3. Select pipe materials appropriate for temporary installation (coordinate with DEL-00.02)
2.4. Determine burial depth or above-ground protection method (consider traffic, freeze protection, relocation needs)
2.5. Identify valve locations for isolation and control
2.6. Consider future relocation or expansion needs
2.7. Coordinate routing with Employer to minimize terminal operational impact (OBJ-5)

### 3. Develop connection details design

**Action:** Design connection to existing water supply.

**Sub-steps:**
3.1. Select connection method appropriate for existing system (tap sleeve, hydrant connection, etc.)
3.2. Design valve installation for isolation and control
3.3. Include meter installation if required by utility or Employer
3.4. Design temporary/permanent interface to allow clean removal later
3.5. Coordinate connection design with water utility provider for approval
3.6. Plan shutdown requirements and schedule to minimize terminal operational impact (OBJ-5)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Technical and Performance Requirements section; Guidance.md Drawing content; Guidance.md Trade-offs)

### 4. Develop backflow prevention details design

**Action:** Design backflow preventer installation per code requirements.

**Sub-steps:**
4.1. Perform hazard assessment to determine backflow preventer type required (coordinate with authority having jurisdiction) (**TBD** — hazard assessment criteria not specified)
4.2. Size backflow preventer based on water demand
4.3. Design installation configuration (orientation, piping, valves, test cocks, drain)
4.4. Provide clearances for testing and maintenance
4.5. Include freeze protection if required (insulation, enclosure, heat trace)
4.6. Verify compliance with applicable codes (BC Plumbing Code, CSA B64 series, etc.)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Technical and Performance Requirements section; Guidance.md Drawing content; Guidance.md Trade-offs)

### 5. Prepare drawing set

**Action:** Produce drawings per project CAD standards.

**Sub-steps:**
5.1. Set up drawing files using project CAD templates and standards (**TBD** — CAD standards not specified)
5.2. Prepare temporary water service routing drawing (plan and profile)
5.3. Prepare connection details drawing
5.4. Prepare backflow prevention details drawing
5.5. Apply consistent symbology, annotation standards, and details across all drawings (**TBD** — drawing standards not specified)
5.6. Include title blocks, legends, notes, and code references
5.7. Ensure dimensional accuracy and internal consistency

(ASSUMPTION: CAD drafting workflow. Cross-reference: Specification.md Quality Requirements section)

### 6. Coordinate and review

**Action:** Coordinate design with stakeholders and perform internal review.

**Sub-steps:**
6.1. Coordinate routing with DEL-00.01 team to verify alignment with site layout
6.2. Coordinate materials/specifications with DEL-00.02 team
6.3. Submit design to water utility provider for connection approval (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
6.4. Coordinate with Employer for connection point access and shutdown scheduling
6.5. Perform internal review for code compliance, constructibility, and coordination
6.6. Address review comments and update drawings

(Cross-reference: Guidance.md Dependencies and coordination)

### 7. Issue drawing set

**Action:** Submit drawings per project document control process.

**Sub-steps:**
7.1. Prepare drawing transmittal package (**TBD** — transmittal format not specified)
7.2. Submit to project document control system (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
7.3. Distribute to Employer, water utility, authorities (if required), and project stakeholders

## Verification
