# Guidance: DEL-00.08 Temporary Water Supply Installation Details

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Temporary Water Supply Installation Details, which define the design arrangement and details for temporary water supply installation per ER requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148)

This deliverable establishes the temporary water supply design to support construction activities while coordinating with existing terminal infrastructure and codes. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Purpose section)

## Principles

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Temporary water supply design implications:**
- Connection method should minimize disruption to existing water service (avoid shutdowns during terminal operational hours if possible)
- Routing should avoid interference with terminal traffic and cargo handling
- Installation activities should be scheduled and staged to minimize terminal operational impact
- Temporary installation should allow for future removal without affecting permanent infrastructure

(ASSUMPTION: Typical considerations for temporary utility installation at operating facilities.)

### Code compliance

Backflow prevention is typically mandatory per plumbing codes to protect potable water supply. Ensure backflow preventer type, size, and installation comply with applicable codes. (ASSUMPTION: Standard code requirement)

### Design for constructibility and maintainability

Temporary water system will be installed, used, maintained, and eventually removed. Design for ease of construction, access for maintenance/repairs, and clean removal. (ASSUMPTION: Standard temporary works design practice)

## Considerations

### Drawing content

**Temporary water service routing** — Consider:
- Water source (existing water service, hydrant, well)
- Connection point location and access
- Pipe routing to distribution points (offices, welfare facilities, wash stations, fire protection, construction uses)
- Pipe sizing (based on demand, pressure, flow requirements)
- Pipe materials (PVC, HDPE, or other suitable for temporary installation)
- Pipe burial depth or above-ground protection
- Freeze protection (burial depth, insulation, heat trace)
- Future relocation needs as site layout changes

**Connection details** — Consider:
- Connection method (tap sleeve, wet tap, dry tap, hydrant connection)
- Valve installation for isolation and control
- Meter installation (if required by utility or Employer)
- Temporary vs. permanent interface (ensuring clean removal later)
- Coordination with water utility provider for connection approval
- Shutdown scheduling (minimize disruption to terminal operations per OBJ-5)

**Backflow prevention details** — Consider:
- Backflow preventer type (reduced pressure zone, double check valve, atmospheric vacuum breaker - based on hazard level)
- Device sizing (based on flow requirements)
- Installation configuration (orientation, clearances, drainage, freeze protection)
- Testing provisions (test cocks, isolation valves, drainage)
- Code compliance (BC Plumbing Code, local authority requirements)
- Maintenance access

(Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

### Reference materials

- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements, existing water system drawings, water utility standards, and plumbing codes not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: When reference materials become available, review for:
- Existing water system capacity, pressure, connection points
- Water utility provider requirements and approval procedures
- Backflow prevention requirements (hazard assessment, device selection)
- Freeze protection requirements (climate data, burial depths)

### Dependencies and coordination

- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for temporary facility locations and water demand points
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.02 (Site Establishment Technical Specification) for pipe materials, backflow preventer specifications, and installation standards
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with water utility provider for connection approval and requirements
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with Employer for connection point access and shutdown scheduling (OBJ-5)

## Trade-offs

### Connection method: permanent tap vs. temporary hydrant connection

**Consideration:** Permanent tap (sleeve/valve installation on existing main) provides reliable connection but requires main shutdown and remains after project. Temporary hydrant connection avoids main modification but may have capacity/pressure limitations.

**Guidance:** Evaluate based on water demand, duration, existing system configuration, and Employer preferences. For large/long-duration projects, permanent tap may be warranted. For smaller/shorter projects, hydrant connection may suffice. Coordinate with water utility and Employer.

### Pipe routing: buried vs. above-ground

**Consideration:** Buried pipe provides protection and keeps surface clear but increases installation cost and difficulty of relocation. Above-ground pipe reduces installation cost and allows easy relocation but requires protection from traffic/damage and freeze protection.

**Guidance:** Bury pipe in areas with vehicular traffic, long-term installations, or freeze risk. Use above-ground (with protection) in laydown areas, short-duration installations, or where frequent relocation expected. Hybrid approach often optimal (bury in traffic areas, above-ground in laydown).

### Backflow preventer type: reduced pressure zone (RPZ) vs. double check valve (DCVA)

**Consideration:** RPZ provides higher protection level and is typically required for high hazard applications but is more expensive and requires drainage provisions. DCVA is less expensive and simpler to install but provides lower protection and may not be acceptable for some applications.

**Guidance:** Follow code requirements based on hazard assessment. Construction sites often classified as high hazard (contamination risk) requiring RPZ. Confirm requirements with authority having jurisdiction. Don't under-specify to save cost if code requires RPZ.

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and code requirements are available.
