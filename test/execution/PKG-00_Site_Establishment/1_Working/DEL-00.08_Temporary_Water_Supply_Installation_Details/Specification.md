# Specification: DEL-00.08 Temporary Water Supply Installation Details

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for the Temporary Water Supply Installation Details deliverable within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148)

**Deliverable purpose:** Defines the design arrangement and details for temporary water supply installation details per ER requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

Temporary water supply installation shall minimize disruption to existing water service and coordinate with terminal operational needs.

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The drawing set shall include the following artifacts (minimum 3 drawings):

1. **Temporary water service routing** — Plan and profile showing temporary water pipe routing from connection point (existing water service or hydrant) to site distribution points (office trailers, welfare facilities, construction areas), including pipe sizing, materials, and layout

2. **Connection details** — Detailed drawings showing connection to existing water supply, including tapping method, valve installation, meter installation (if required), and temporary vs. permanent connection interface

3. **Backflow prevention details** — Detailed drawings showing backflow preventer installation, including device type/size, installation configuration, testing provisions, and compliance with plumbing codes

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148.

ASSUMPTION: Drawing scope interpretation based on typical temporary water supply requirements for construction sites. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and codes once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section)

### Technical and Performance Requirements

**Water demand:**
- **TBD** — Water demand (potable, fire protection, construction uses) not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Pipe sizing and routing:**
- Pipe sizing shall provide adequate capacity for anticipated demand
- Routing shall minimize conflicts with construction activities and terminal operations (OBJ-5)
- Routing shall consider freeze protection, protection from damage, and future relocation/expansion needs
- **TBD** — Specific sizing criteria, routing constraints, and protection requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Connection requirements:**
- Connection to existing water supply shall be coordinated with water utility provider and Employer
- Connection method shall minimize disruption to existing service (OBJ-5)
- Temporary connections shall allow for future removal without damaging permanent infrastructure
- **TBD** — Connection point location, utility provider requirements, and coordination procedures not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Backflow prevention:**
- Backflow preventer shall be provided per applicable codes to protect potable water supply
- Device type and size shall be appropriate for application and water demand
- Installation shall allow for testing and maintenance
- **TBD** — Specific backflow prevention requirements and device specifications not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Interface Requirements

**Interface with existing water supply:**
- Drawings shall identify connection point to existing water system
- Coordinate connection with water utility provider and Employer
- **TBD** — Existing water system capacity, pressure, and connection procedures not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**
- ASSUMPTION: Drawings interface with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for temporary facility locations, and DEL-00.02 (Site Establishment Technical Specification) for materials and installation standards. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section; Procedure.md Prerequisites section)

### Quality Requirements

**Drawing quality:**
- Drawings shall be clear, complete, and constructible
- Details shall show sufficient information for installation
- Coordination with codes and standards shall be demonstrated
- **TBD** — Drawing review and approval requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable codes and standards:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1) listed in decomposition but not yet available. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable codes and standards may include:
- BC Plumbing Code
- Local water utility standards
- CSA B64 series (backflow prevention)
- AWWA standards (water distribution)

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- All three drawings listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted (minimum 3 drawings). (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Verification section)

**Coordination check:**
- Verify coordination with site layout, water utility, and applicable codes

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs:**

1. Temporary water service routing
2. Connection details
3. Backflow prevention details

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.08, line 148. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Procedure.md Records section; Guidance.md Examples section)

**Documentation control:**
- **TBD** — Document control, numbering, and revision requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
