# Guidance: DEL-00.03 Site Establishment Procedures

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Site Establishment Procedures, which define the execution method and controls for site establishment to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.03, line 143)

This deliverable establishes the execution controls for temporary works construction, ensuring safe, quality, and coordinated site establishment while supporting terminal continuity. The procedure set (minimum 3 procedures) defines the "how" for site establishment execution. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section for project objectives; Datasheet.md Attributes section for procedure count and list; Procedure.md Purpose section for development process)

## Principles

### Scope alignment

Procedures should reflect the site establishment scope: temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, and traffic management. (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)

Temporary works enabling scope is distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Procedure implications:**

- Traffic management procedures must coordinate construction and terminal operational traffic to minimize conflicts, delays, or safety risks
- Site access procedures must integrate with terminal security protocols to avoid disrupting cargo operations or creating security gaps
- Mobilization procedures must sequence activities to minimize noise, dust, traffic congestion, or other impacts on terminal operations
- All procedures should emphasize communication, coordination, and respect for ongoing terminal activities

(ASSUMPTION: Typical considerations for construction procedures at operating terminals. Specific protocols to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and coordination meetings.)

### Contractor scope boundary

Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections; procedures should avoid assuming Employer-furnished resources or controls unless interfaces are explicitly required. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2, line 48)

ASSUMPTION: Employer may control terminal access, security protocols, or operational traffic patterns. Procedure interfaces to be confirmed once Employer's Requirements are available.

### Procedure clarity and executability

Each procedure should be clear, step-by-step, and executable by field personnel. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Documentation Requirements section)

- Define roles and responsibilities for each procedure step
- Specify prerequisites (what must be in place before starting)
- Provide sequential steps with decision points and hold points
- Define verification methods (how to confirm each step succeeded)
- Specify records (what documentation results from execution)

(ASSUMPTION: Standard procedure format for EPC projects)

## Considerations

### Procedure content and organization

Ensure the procedure content aligns with the anticipated artifacts:

1. **Traffic management plan** — Consider:
   - Construction traffic routing (delivery vehicles, equipment, personnel)
   - Interface with terminal operational traffic (separation, coordination points)
   - Speed limits, signage, pavement markings
   - Pedestrian routes and crossings
   - Flaggers, traffic control personnel, communication protocols
   - Emergency vehicle access
   - Phasing (changes over time as construction progresses)
   - Monitoring and enforcement

2. **Site access procedure** — Consider:
   - Security gate locations and operating hours
   - Badging and visitor sign-in processes
   - Vehicle inspection and parking controls
   - Contractor personnel onboarding and orientation
   - Visitor escort requirements
   - After-hours and emergency access
   - Coordination with terminal security
   - Lost badge procedures and access revocation

3. **Mobilization procedure** — Consider:
   - Sequencing of mobilization activities (site prep, fencing, utilities, facilities)
   - Temporary facility setup and commissioning
   - Utility connections and testing
   - Equipment delivery and laydown
   - Personnel onboarding, orientation, training
   - Document control and IT system setup
   - Readiness verification and sign-off
   - Demobilization planning (end-of-project)

### Reference materials

Employer's Requirements are listed as reference documents but are not yet available in this deliverable's references; requirements should be treated as **TBD** until provided. (Source: decomposition Section 3, lines 75–79; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: When Employer's Requirements become available, review for:

- Terminal operational constraints and traffic patterns
- Terminal security protocols and access control requirements
- Interface requirements with existing terminal systems
- HSE requirements affecting construction procedures
- QA/QC and approval workflow requirements

### Dependencies and coordination

Dependencies are coordinated externally in NOT_TRACKED mode; confirm required inputs with the human or coordination process. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Likely coordination interfaces include:

- DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) — alignment on layout, routing, and physical arrangement
- DEL-00.02 (Site Establishment Technical Specification) — alignment on materials, construction methods, and quality criteria
- Project HSE Management Plan — alignment on safety controls and emergency procedures
- Project QA/QC Plan — alignment on inspection, testing, and documentation requirements
- Employer's terminal operational and security protocols

### Project location context

Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)

ASSUMPTION: Site-specific considerations may include:

- Terminal operational hours, traffic volumes, cargo handling schedules
- Existing terminal security systems and protocols
- Local traffic regulations and authority approvals required
- Proximity to waterfront and environmental sensitivities
- Seasonal constraints (weather, winter operations)

(Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and site coordination.)

## Trade-offs

### Procedure detail: prescriptive vs. performance-based

**Consideration:** Prescriptive procedures specify exact steps and methods; performance-based procedures specify outcomes and allow contractor flexibility in execution methods.

**Guidance:** Balance prescription and flexibility based on risk. For safety-critical or interface-sensitive activities (traffic management, security access), be more prescriptive to ensure consistency and coordination. For routine activities (mobilization sequencing), allow contractor flexibility to adapt to site conditions and schedule.

(ASSUMPTION: Typical approach for construction procedures. Specific balance to be confirmed from project HSE/QA standards.)

### Coordination rigor: continuous vs. periodic

**Consideration:** Continuous coordination (real-time communication, daily meetings) provides better integration with terminal operations but requires more resources. Periodic coordination (weekly meetings, scheduled notifications) reduces resource demand but may miss short-term conflicts.

**Guidance:** For activities with high potential for operational disruption (major deliveries, road closures, utility outages), use continuous coordination. For routine activities (normal site access, standard traffic routing), periodic coordination may suffice. Align coordination rigor with OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity objective.

(ASSUMPTION: Coordination strategy to be confirmed from project execution plan and Employer expectations.)

### Documentation burden: comprehensive vs. streamlined

**Consideration:** Comprehensive documentation (detailed records, extensive sign-offs) provides better traceability but increases administrative effort. Streamlined documentation (summary logs, spot checks) reduces burden but may leave gaps in records.

**Guidance:** Balance documentation requirements with project QA/QC needs. For temporary works, avoid over-documentation of routine activities. Focus records on critical hold points, interface verifications, and acceptance sign-offs.

(ASSUMPTION: Documentation strategy to be confirmed from project QA/QC plan.)

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and site-specific constraints are available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
