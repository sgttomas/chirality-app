# Guidance: DEL-00.03 Site Establishment Procedures

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Site Establishment Procedures, which define the execution method and controls for site establishment to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.03)

## Principles

- **Scope alignment:** Procedures should reflect the site establishment scope (temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, and traffic management). (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope)
- **Terminal continuity objective (best-effort mapping):** This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity, whose objective is to minimize disturbance to existing terminal commercial activities. Treat this as contextual guidance until confirmed by the human. (Source: decomposition Section 2, OBJ-5 description; Section 6 objective mapping)
- **Contractor scope boundary:** Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections; procedures should avoid assuming Employer-furnished scope unless interfaces are explicitly required. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2)

## Considerations

- Ensure the procedure set aligns with anticipated artifacts (traffic management plan, site access procedure, mobilization procedure). (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.03)
- Employer's Requirements are listed as reference documents but are not yet available in this deliverable's references; requirements should be treated as **TBD** until provided. (Source: decomposition Section 3; `_REFERENCES.md`)
- Dependencies are coordinated externally in NOT_TRACKED mode; confirm required inputs with the human or coordination process. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; `_COORDINATION.md`)

## Trade-offs

- **TBD** — Trade-offs are not identified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Examples

**Anticipated artifacts (examples of procedure outputs):**

- Traffic management plan
- Site access procedure
- Mobilization procedure
