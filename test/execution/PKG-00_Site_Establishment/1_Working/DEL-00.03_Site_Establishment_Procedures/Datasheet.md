## Conditions

**Project and scope context (applicable to site establishment procedures):**

- Temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, traffic management. (Source: `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Intent of procedures:**

- Define execution method and controls for site establishment to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.03, line 143)

**Operational context:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- Procedures shall enable construction activities while minimizing disruption to existing terminal commercial operations (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)
- **TBD** — Existing terminal operational patterns, traffic volumes, security protocols, and constraints not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated procedure artifacts:**

- Traffic management plan
- Site access procedure
- Mobilization procedure

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.03, line 143.

**Procedure content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Traffic management plan:** Methods and controls for managing construction vehicle and personnel traffic within the terminal, including routing, signage, speed limits, pedestrian safety, interface with terminal operational traffic, and phasing
- **Site access procedure:** Methods and controls for controlling access to the construction site, including security gates, badging, visitor sign-in, vehicle inspection, emergency access, and coordination with terminal security
- **Mobilization procedure:** Methods and controls for mobilizing contractor resources to site, including sequencing, temporary facility setup, utility connections, equipment delivery, personnel onboarding, and readiness verification

(ASSUMPTION: Typical procedure scope for EPC construction site establishment. Specific methods and controls to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and project HSE/QA plans once available.)
