# Specification: DEL-00.03 Site Establishment Procedures

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for the Site Establishment Procedures deliverable within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.03, line 143)

**Package scope context:** Site establishment includes temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates for construction staging, and traffic management. (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)

**Project-level scope boundary:** This decomposition covers Contractor scope only; Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2, line 48)

**Rationale for separate package:** Temporary works enabling scope is distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The procedure set shall include the following artifacts (minimum 3 procedures):

1. **Traffic management plan** — Methods and controls for managing construction vehicle and personnel traffic within the terminal, including routing, signage, speed limits, pedestrian safety, interface with terminal operational traffic, and phasing

2. **Site access procedure** — Methods and controls for controlling access to the construction site, including security gates, badging, visitor sign-in, vehicle inspection, emergency access, and coordination with terminal security

3. **Mobilization procedure** — Methods and controls for mobilizing contractor resources to site, including sequencing, temporary facility setup, utility connections, equipment delivery, personnel onboarding, and readiness verification

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.03, line 143.

ASSUMPTION: Procedure scope interpretation based on typical site establishment requirements for EPC projects. Specific methods and controls to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and project HSE/QA plans once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section for procedure content scope)

### Safety Requirements

- Procedures shall incorporate safety controls to protect construction personnel, terminal employees, and the public. (ASSUMPTION: Standard procedure practice)
- Traffic management shall address vehicle-pedestrian separation, speed control, signage, and emergency access. (ASSUMPTION: Standard traffic management practice)
- **TBD** — Specific safety performance criteria, hazard controls, and WorkSafeBC requirements not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Quality Requirements

- Procedures shall define quality controls, inspection hold points, and acceptance criteria for site establishment activities. (ASSUMPTION: Standard procedure practice)
- **TBD** — Specific QA/QC requirements, documentation standards, and approval workflows not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Operational Requirements

**Coordination with project objectives:**

- Procedures shall define methods that minimize disruption to existing terminal commercial operations (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)
- Traffic management plan shall demonstrate how construction and terminal operational traffic will be separated or coordinated. (ASSUMPTION: Required to support OBJ-5)
- Site access procedure shall coordinate with terminal security protocols. (ASSUMPTION: Required to support OBJ-5)

**TBD — Employer's Requirements content:**

- Specific operational constraints, terminal traffic volumes, security protocols, and interface requirements not yet available in `_REFERENCES.md`. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`; decomposition Section 3, lines 75–79)

### Interface Requirements

**Interface with existing terminal operations:**

- Procedures shall define interface protocols with existing terminal security, traffic management, and operational systems. (ASSUMPTION: Required to support OBJ-5)
- **TBD** — Specific interface coordination requirements, communication protocols, and approval procedures not specified in accessible references. Dependencies are coordinated externally. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**

- ASSUMPTION: Procedures interface with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for layout and routing, and DEL-00.02 (Site Establishment Technical Specification) for materials and workmanship standards. Coordination to be confirmed during working sessions. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section for coordination interfaces; Procedure.md Prerequisites section for dependency coordination)

### Documentation Requirements

- Procedures shall be clear, step-by-step, and executable by field personnel. (ASSUMPTION: Standard procedure practice)
- Procedures shall include roles/responsibilities, prerequisites, steps, verification, and records requirements. (ASSUMPTION: Standard procedure format)
- **TBD** — Procedure format, approval workflow, and revision management requirements not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable codes and standards:**

- **TBD** — No applicable standards explicitly identified in accessible references for this deliverable. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements) listed in decomposition but not yet available in this deliverable's references. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable standards for site establishment procedures may include:

- WorkSafeBC Occupational Health and Safety Regulation
- BC Motor Vehicle Act and Commercial Transport Regulations (traffic management)
- Local authority traffic management guidelines
- Terminal security and operational protocols

(Standards to be confirmed once Employer's Requirements are available.)

## Verification

**Procedure review process:**

- **TBD** — Internal review, HSE review, and approval requirements not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Employer review and acceptance criteria not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Completeness check:**

- Each procedure listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted (minimum 3 procedures). (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section for procedure list and count; Procedure.md Verification section for completeness verification)

**Coordination check:**

- Procedures shall be coordinated with DEL-00.01 and DEL-00.02. (Cross-reference: Procedure.md Verification section for coordination check)

**OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity check:**

- Verify traffic management plan demonstrates how construction activities minimize disruption to terminal operations. (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Cross-reference: Procedure.md Verification section)
