# Specification: DEL-00.06 Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for the Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report deliverable within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.06, line 146)

**Deliverable purpose:** Documents analysis and results for pre-works road condition survey report required for design verification and approvals. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.06, line 146)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

By establishing baseline road conditions, this survey supports fair assessment of construction impacts and facilitates restoration to minimize long-term disruption to terminal operations.

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The survey documentation shall include the following artifacts (minimum 2 documents):

1. **Baseline road condition survey report** — Documented pre-construction condition of access roads and haul routes including pavement type, overall condition rating, specific defects (cracks, potholes, edge deterioration), drainage condition, signage/markings, and survey date/weather conditions

2. **Photo log** — Comprehensive photographic record of pre-construction road conditions with location references, date stamps, and annotations identifying key features and existing defects

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.06, line 146.

ASSUMPTION: Report scope interpretation based on typical pre-construction road condition survey practice. Specific survey methodology and reporting requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section)

### Survey Requirements

**Survey area:**

- **TBD** — Specific survey area extent and road segments not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Survey methodology:**
- Conduct visual inspection of pavement, shoulders, drainage, and appurtenances
- Rate overall condition and document specific defects
- Photograph all surveyed areas with sufficient coverage for future comparison
- Record survey date, weather conditions, and surveyor identification
- **TBD** — Specific survey methodology, condition rating system, and photographic standards not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Survey timing:**
- Survey shall be conducted prior to commencement of construction traffic
- Coordinate survey timing with Employer and authorities to ensure baseline is established before any construction impacts
- **TBD** — Specific survey timing and approval requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Reporting Requirements

**Baseline road condition survey report content:**
- Executive summary of overall road conditions
- Survey area description and limits
- Survey methodology and rating system used
- Pavement type and existing condition for each road segment
- Inventory of existing defects (location, type, severity)
- Drainage condition assessment
- Signage and pavement marking inventory
- Survey date, weather conditions, and personnel
- Appendices: photo log, survey forms, condition rating definitions

**Photo log content:**
- Systematic photographic coverage of all surveyed areas
- Location reference for each photo (station/offset, GPS coordinates, or landmark description)
- Date stamp on photos
- Annotations identifying key features and existing defects
- Index or table linking photos to report sections

**TBD** — Specific report format, organization, and level of detail not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Coordination Requirements

**OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity coordination:**
- Survey activities shall be scheduled to minimize disruption to terminal operations
- Coordinate survey timing and access with terminal operations
- Establish baseline that supports fair post-construction assessment to minimize disputes affecting terminal

**Authority coordination:**
- Coordinate with applicable road authorities (City of Surrey, TransLink, Port Authority) if required
- **TBD** — Authority coordination and approval requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**
- ASSUMPTION: Survey interfaces with DEL-00.07 (Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report) as companion baseline/comparison pair. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section; Procedure.md Prerequisites section)

### Quality Requirements

- Survey shall be conducted by qualified surveyor/inspector
- Survey shall be thorough, systematic, and reproducible
- Photography shall be clear, comprehensive, and properly referenced
- Report shall be accurate, complete, and suitable for baseline/comparison purposes
- **TBD** — Specific surveyor qualifications and quality assurance requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable standards:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1) listed in decomposition but not yet available. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable standards may include:
- ASTM pavement condition survey standards
- Local authority road condition rating systems
- Photographic documentation standards

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- Both documents listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Verification section)

**Quality check:**
- Verify survey coverage is complete for all construction access routes
- Verify photographic documentation is comprehensive and properly referenced
- Verify report is suitable for baseline/comparison purposes

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs:**

1. Baseline road condition survey report
2. Photo log
