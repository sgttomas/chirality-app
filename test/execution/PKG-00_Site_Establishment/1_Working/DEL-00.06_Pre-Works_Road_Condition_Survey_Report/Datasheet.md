## Conditions

**Project and scope context:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Deliverable intent:**

- Documents analysis and results for pre-works road condition survey report required for design verification and approvals. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.06, line 146)

**Survey context:**

- Survey shall establish baseline road conditions prior to construction traffic to support post-construction comparison and deficiency determination.
- Survey supports minimizing disputes over construction-induced road damage and terminal continuity (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)
- **TBD** — Survey area extent, access road designations, and condition rating methodology not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated report artifacts:**

- Baseline road condition survey report
- Photo log

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.06, line 146.

**Report content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Baseline road condition survey report:** Documented pre-construction condition of access roads and haul routes including pavement type, overall condition rating, specific defects (cracks, potholes, edge deterioration), drainage condition, signage/markings, and survey date/weather conditions
- **Photo log:** Comprehensive photographic record of pre-construction road conditions with location references, date stamps, and annotations identifying key features and existing defects

(ASSUMPTION: Typical road condition survey documentation for construction projects. Specific survey methodology and reporting format to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)
