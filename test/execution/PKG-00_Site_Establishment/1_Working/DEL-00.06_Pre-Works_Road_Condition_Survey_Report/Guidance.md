# Guidance: DEL-00.06 Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report, which documents analysis and results for pre-works road condition survey report required for design verification and approvals. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.06, line 146)

This deliverable establishes the baseline road conditions prior to construction, supporting fair assessment of construction-induced damage and facilitating terminal continuity by enabling appropriate restoration. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Purpose section)

## Principles

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Baseline survey implications:**
- Accurate baseline documentation minimizes disputes over construction-induced road damage
- Fair post-construction assessment enables appropriate restoration without over/under repair
- Comprehensive baseline supports efficient dispute resolution, avoiding prolonged terminal operational impacts
- Survey activities should be scheduled to minimize disruption to terminal traffic

(ASSUMPTION: Baseline survey supports terminal continuity by facilitating fair, efficient restoration and dispute resolution.)

### Survey accuracy and thoroughness

Survey must be sufficiently thorough and systematic to support future comparison. Document existing defects clearly to distinguish from construction-induced damage. (ASSUMPTION: Required for baseline/comparison purpose)

### Photographic documentation quality

Photographic coverage must be comprehensive and properly referenced. Photos should show overall conditions and specific defects with sufficient clarity for future comparison. (ASSUMPTION: Standard survey documentation practice)

## Considerations

### Survey planning

**Survey area determination:**
- Identify all roads and routes that will experience construction traffic (access roads, haul routes, delivery routes)
- Include terminal internal roads and interface with public roads (Elevator Road)
- Consider secondary routes that may be used occasionally or as alternates
- Coordinate with DEL-00.05 (Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission) to understand planned routing

**Survey timing:**
- Conduct survey after site access is planned but before construction traffic begins
- Schedule to minimize interference with terminal operations
- Consider weather conditions (avoid surveying during/after rain if possible; document conditions if unavoidable)
- Allow sufficient time for review and approval before mobilization

(Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Conditions section; Specification.md Survey Requirements section)

### Survey execution

**Visual inspection approach:**
- Walk or drive survey routes systematically (station-by-station or segment-by-segment)
- Rate overall pavement condition (excellent, good, fair, poor, or numerical rating system)
- Document specific defects (cracks: transverse, longitudinal, alligator; potholes; edge deterioration; rutting; settlements)
- Assess drainage condition (functioning, partially blocked, blocked, erosion)
- Inventory signage and pavement markings

**Photographic documentation approach:**
- Establish systematic photo intervals (e.g., every 50m, or at key features and defects)
- Take overview photos showing general conditions and context
- Take close-up photos of specific defects with scale reference (measuring tape, coin, etc.)
- Use consistent photo orientation and lighting where possible
- Ensure photo locations are clearly referenced (station/offset, GPS, landmarks)

**Documentation during survey:**
- Complete survey forms in field (don't rely on memory later)
- Record survey date, time, weather conditions, personnel
- Note any unusual conditions or limitations (construction activity blocking view, recent maintenance, etc.)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Survey Requirements section; Procedure.md Steps section)

### Report development

**Baseline road condition survey report organization:**
- Executive summary: overall findings and significant existing defects
- Survey methodology: area, methods, rating system, personnel
- Findings by road segment: pavement type, condition rating, defect inventory
- Photo log cross-reference
- Appendices: survey forms, condition rating definitions, detailed defect locations

**Photo log organization:**
- Index table linking photo numbers to locations and report sections
- Photos organized by route/segment
- Annotations on photos or in captions identifying key features and defects

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section)

### Reference materials

- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements, survey standards, and condition rating systems not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Dependencies and coordination

- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.05 (Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission) to understand planned construction routing
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.07 (Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report) to ensure consistent survey methodology for comparison
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with Employer terminal operations to schedule survey access

## Trade-offs

### Survey detail: comprehensive vs. focused

**Consideration:** Comprehensive survey (document every minor defect) provides complete baseline but increases survey effort and report length. Focused survey (document significant defects only) reduces effort but may miss items that become disputed later.

**Guidance:** Balance detail with practicality. Document all defects that could reasonably be attributed to construction traffic (cracks, potholes, edge deterioration). Minor cosmetic issues may be noted generally without exhaustive inventory. Err toward more comprehensive for areas expecting heavy construction traffic.

### Photographic coverage: extensive vs. targeted

**Consideration:** Extensive photography (every 10-20m) provides complete visual record but generates large photo sets. Targeted photography (key features and defects only) reduces volume but may miss context.

**Guidance:** Use systematic interval photography for overall context (e.g., every 50m) plus targeted close-ups for specific defects. Adjust interval based on road length and defect density. For short routes or heavily defected areas, use shorter intervals.

### Report format: detailed vs. summary

**Consideration:** Detailed report (segment-by-segment narrative, extensive defect descriptions) provides thorough documentation but may obscure key findings. Summary report (tabular data, brief narratives) is concise but may lack context.

**Guidance:** Use hybrid approach: executive summary and tabular data for overall conditions; detailed descriptions for significant defects or unusual conditions. Use appendices for detailed survey forms and raw data.

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and survey standards are available.
