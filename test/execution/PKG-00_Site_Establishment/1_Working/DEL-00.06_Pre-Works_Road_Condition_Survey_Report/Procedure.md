# Procedure: DEL-00.06 Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report deliverable (minimum 2 documents) for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section)

This procedure covers survey planning, field execution, reporting, and approval to establish baseline road conditions prior to construction. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Guidance.md Purpose section)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

NOT_TRACKED. Dependencies are coordinated externally by humans. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Likely prerequisite deliverables and inputs include:
- Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements)
- DEL-00.05 (Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission) to identify construction routing
- Site access permission from Employer
- Survey standards and condition rating system

### Reference materials

**Required inputs:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Survey standards and pavement condition rating systems not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Survey area definition and road segment designations not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Steps

### 1. Plan survey scope and methodology

**Action:** Define survey area, methodology, and schedule.

**Sub-steps:**
1.1. Identify roads and routes subject to construction traffic (coordinate with DEL-00.05)
1.2. Define survey area limits and segment boundaries
1.3. Select condition rating system (ASTM standard, local authority system, or project-specific) (**TBD** — rating system not specified)
1.4. Define photographic documentation protocol (interval, format, referencing method)
1.5. Prepare survey forms and photo log templates
1.6. Schedule survey to occur prior to construction mobilization
1.7. Coordinate survey access with Employer terminal operations (OBJ-5)

(ASSUMPTION: Survey planning workflow. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Survey planning)

### 2. Conduct field survey

**Action:** Execute visual inspection and photographic documentation of road conditions.

**Sub-steps:**
2.1. Mobilize to survey area with survey forms, camera, GPS (if used), measuring tools, safety equipment
2.2. Systematically traverse each road segment
2.3. Rate overall pavement condition per rating system
2.4. Document specific defects (type, location, severity, dimensions where applicable)
2.5. Assess drainage condition and functionality
2.6. Inventory signage and pavement markings
2.7. Take systematic photographs per protocol (interval photos plus targeted defect photos)
2.8. Record survey date, time, weather conditions, personnel
2.9. Complete survey forms in field (don't rely on memory)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Survey Requirements section; Guidance.md Survey execution)

### 3. Organize and process field data

**Action:** Compile survey data and organize photographic documentation.

**Sub-steps:**
3.1. Review survey forms for completeness and legibility
3.2. Download and organize photographs
3.3. Create photo log index linking photos to locations and report sections
3.4. Annotate photos or create captions identifying key features and defects
3.5. Verify photo locations and descriptions are accurate
3.6. Identify any data gaps or unclear findings requiring field verification

### 4. Prepare baseline road condition survey report

**Action:** Compile findings into survey report document.

**Sub-steps:**
4.1. Prepare report using project template (**TBD** — template not specified)
4.2. Write executive summary of overall conditions and significant findings
4.3. Document survey area, methodology, and rating system
4.4. Present findings by road segment (pavement type, condition rating, defect inventory)
4.5. Document drainage assessment and signage inventory
4.6. Cross-reference photo log
4.7. Prepare appendices (survey forms, condition rating definitions, detailed defect tables)
4.8. Review report for accuracy, completeness, and clarity

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Guidance.md Report development)

### 5. Prepare photo log

**Action:** Compile photographic documentation into organized log.

**Sub-steps:**
5.1. Create photo index table (photo number, location, description, date)
5.2. Organize photos by route/segment
5.3. Add annotations or captions to photos identifying features and defects
5.4. Verify all photos are properly referenced and indexed
5.5. Review photo log for completeness and quality

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Guidance.md Report development)

### 6. Review and finalize deliverable

**Action:** Perform quality review and obtain approvals.

**Sub-steps:**
6.1. Conduct internal review for completeness and accuracy
6.2. Verify survey methodology and findings are clearly documented
6.3. Verify photo log is comprehensive and properly referenced
6.4. Address review comments and update documents
6.5. Obtain required approvals (**TBD** — approval workflow not specified)

### 7. Issue survey report

**Action:** Submit survey documentation per project document control process.

**Sub-steps:**
7.1. Prepare transmittal package (**TBD** — transmittal format not specified)
7.2. Submit to project document control system (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
7.3. Distribute to Employer, authorities (if required), and project stakeholders
7.4. Retain survey records for post-construction comparison (DEL-00.07)

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- Confirm baseline road condition survey report and photo log have been produced. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

**Coverage check:**
- Verify survey covers all roads and routes subject to construction traffic
- Verify photographic documentation is comprehensive

**Quality check:**
- Verify survey is systematic, reproducible, and suitable for baseline/comparison purposes
- Verify photographs are clear, properly referenced, and adequately document existing conditions

**Coordination check:**
- Verify survey methodology is consistent with DEL-00.07 post-works survey approach (to enable comparison)
