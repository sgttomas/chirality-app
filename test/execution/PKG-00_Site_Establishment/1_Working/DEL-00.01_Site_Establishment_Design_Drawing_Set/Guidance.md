# Guidance: DEL-00.01 Site Establishment Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Site Establishment Design Drawing Set, which defines the design arrangement and details for site establishment per Employer's Requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.01, line 141)

This deliverable establishes the temporary works foundation for construction execution while minimizing disruption to the operating terminal. The drawing set (minimum 4 drawings) communicates the physical layout and traffic management approach for construction staging. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section for project objectives; Datasheet.md Attributes section for drawing count and list; Procedure.md Purpose section for production process)

## Principles

### Scope alignment

Drawings should reflect the site establishment scope: temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, and traffic management. (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)

Temporary works enabling scope is distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Design implications:**

- Site layout and traffic management must accommodate continued terminal operations during construction
- Laydown areas should be positioned to avoid interference with active cargo handling zones
- Construction access routes should minimize crossing paths with terminal operational traffic
- Temporary facility locations should respect existing terminal security and operational boundaries

(ASSUMPTION: Typical considerations for construction staging at operating terminals. Specific constraints to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and site coordination meetings.)

### Contractor scope boundary

Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections; drawings should avoid assuming Employer-furnished scope unless interfaces are explicitly required. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2, line 48)

ASSUMPTION: Employer-furnished items may include existing terminal infrastructure, utilities tie-in points, and operational areas. Interface identification to be confirmed once Employer's Requirements are available.

### Drawing clarity and completeness

Each drawing should communicate design intent clearly and unambiguously. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Technical and Performance Requirements section)

- Use consistent symbology, annotation standards, and drawing conventions across all sheets
- Include sufficient notes, legends, and references to support construction and coordination
- Ensure dimensioning, labeling, and scale are appropriate for intended use

(ASSUMPTION: Standard drawing practice for EPC projects)

## Considerations

### Drawing list and content

Ensure the drawing list aligns with the anticipated artifacts:

1. **Site layout plan** — Consider site boundaries, property lines, existing terminal features, construction zones, and access points
2. **Compound layout** — Consider office trailer sizing/count, welfare facilities, parking, material storage segregation, security fencing
3. **Temporary facilities location plan** — Consider proximity to work areas, utility tie-in distances, future relocation/expansion needs
4. **Traffic management drawings** — Consider construction vehicle routing, pedestrian safety, signage/barriers, phasing with terminal operations

### Reference materials

Employer's Requirements are listed as reference documents but are not yet available in this deliverable's references; requirements should be treated as **TBD** until provided. (Source: decomposition Section 3, lines 75–79; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: When Employer's Requirements become available, review for:

- Site-specific constraints (soil conditions, utilities, existing infrastructure)
- Terminal operational requirements and restrictions
- Security and access control requirements
- Environmental and safety requirements affecting temporary works
- Dimensional and layout criteria for temporary facilities

### Dependencies and coordination

Dependencies are coordinated externally in NOT_TRACKED mode; confirm required inputs with the human or coordination process. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Likely coordination interfaces include:

- DEL-00.02 (Site Establishment Technical Specification) — alignment on materials, performance criteria
- DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) — alignment on traffic management, site access controls
- Survey data and existing conditions documentation
- Employer's terminal operational constraints and interface requirements

### Project location context

Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)

ASSUMPTION: Site-specific considerations may include:

- Local climate (rainfall, seasonal constraints affecting site access and drainage)
- Existing terminal layout and operational patterns
- Local authority requirements for construction staging and traffic management
- Proximity to waterfront and environmental sensitivities

(Specific constraints to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and site investigation.)

## Trade-offs

### Layout efficiency vs. operational impact

**Consideration:** Locating temporary facilities close to work areas reduces construction travel distances but may increase interference with terminal operations.

**Guidance:** Balance layout efficiency with OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity objective. Prioritize layouts that minimize operational disruption even if construction logistics are less optimal. (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63)

### Flexibility vs. permanence

**Consideration:** Temporary works design can range from minimal/expedient to semi-permanent installations.

**Guidance:** Design for the anticipated construction duration and consider relocation/expansion needs. Avoid over-engineering temporary works, but ensure adequate robustness for multi-year construction schedules typical of EPC projects.

(ASSUMPTION: Trade-off between cost, schedule, and operational flexibility. Specific approach to be confirmed during design development.)

### Traffic routing: separation vs. convenience

**Consideration:** Fully separating construction and terminal operational traffic provides maximum safety but may require longer haul routes or additional infrastructure.

**Guidance:** Evaluate traffic management strategies based on site constraints, traffic volumes, and terminal operational priorities. Coordinate with Employer to understand acceptable levels of interaction.

(ASSUMPTION: Traffic management philosophy to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and coordination meetings.)

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and site-specific constraints are available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Examples

### Anticipated artifacts (drawing outputs)

1. **Site layout plan** — Overall arrangement of construction staging, laydown areas, and temporary facility locations within terminal boundaries
2. **Compound layout** — Detailed arrangement of temporary office trailers, welfare facilities, material storage compounds, equipment parking
3. **Temporary facilities location plan** — Positioning and footprints of individual temporary structures and utilities
4. **Traffic management drawings** — Construction traffic routing, access points, signage, phasing, and interface with existing terminal operations
