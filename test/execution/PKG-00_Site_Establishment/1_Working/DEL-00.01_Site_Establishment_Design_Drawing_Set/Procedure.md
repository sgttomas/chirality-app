# Procedure: DEL-00.01 Site Establishment Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Site Establishment Design Drawing Set (minimum 4 drawings) for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section for drawing count)

This procedure covers the workflow from initial input collection through drawing issuance, ensuring compliance with project requirements and support for OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section for project objectives; Guidance.md Principles section for Terminal Continuity design implications)

## Steps

ASSUMPTION: A typical drawing-set production workflow is outlined below. Specific steps will be refined once Employer's Requirements and project QA/QC procedures are available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### 1. Collect inputs and constraints

**Action:** Gather available project inputs and constraints for site establishment.

**Sub-steps:**

1.1. Obtain and review Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements) for site establishment criteria. (**TBD** — not yet available)

1.2. Obtain existing terminal layout drawings and operational constraint documentation from Employer. (**TBD** — not yet available)

1.3. Obtain site survey data (topographic, utility locates) and existing conditions information. (**TBD** — not yet available)

1.4. Review project location context: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)

1.5. Identify missing inputs and mark as **TBD** for coordination.

(ASSUMPTION: Input collection workflow based on typical EPC project practice. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section for reference materials checklist.)

### 2. Define drawing list and content requirements

**Action:** Establish the drawing list aligned with anticipated artifacts and confirm content requirements for each drawing.

**Drawing list (from deliverable scope):**

1. Site layout plan
2. Compound layout
3. Temporary facilities location plan
4. Traffic management drawings

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.01, line 141. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

**Content requirements per drawing:**

- **Site layout plan:** Overall arrangement of construction staging, laydown areas, and temporary facility locations within terminal boundaries. Show property boundaries, existing terminal features, construction limits, access points, utility tie-ins, security fencing.

- **Compound layout:** Detailed arrangement of temporary office trailers, welfare facilities, material storage compounds, equipment parking. Show building footprints, circulation, parking stalls, material storage zones, waste management areas.

- **Temporary facilities location plan:** Positioning and footprints of individual temporary structures and utilities. Show dimensional control, setbacks, utility routing.

- **Traffic management drawings:** Construction traffic routing, access points, signage, phasing, and interface with existing terminal operations. Show routing (in/out), speed limits, signage, pavement markings, pedestrian routes, phasing.

(ASSUMPTION: Content requirements based on typical site establishment drawings. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Examples section. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)

### 3. Develop preliminary layouts

**Action:** Prepare preliminary drawing layouts incorporating project constraints and Terminal Continuity objective (OBJ-5).

**Sub-steps:**

3.1. Develop site layout alternatives considering:
- Minimizing interference with existing terminal commercial operations (OBJ-5)
- Construction logistics efficiency (access, material flow, crane coverage)
- Security and access control compatibility with terminal operations
- Environmental and safety setbacks

3.2. Coordinate preliminary layouts with Employer to confirm operational constraints and interface requirements. (**TBD** — coordination process not yet defined)

3.3. Refine layouts based on Employer feedback and coordination with other deliverables (DEL-00.02, DEL-00.03). (**TBD** — coordination process not yet defined)

(ASSUMPTION: Preliminary layout development workflow. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Trade-offs section for design considerations.)

### 4. Prepare drawing drafts

**Action:** Produce drawing drafts per project CAD/document control standards.

**Sub-steps:**

4.1. Set up drawing files using project CAD templates and standards. (**TBD** — CAD standards not yet available)

4.2. Draft each drawing per the content requirements defined in Step 2.

4.3. Apply consistent symbology, annotation standards, line weights, and text styles across all sheets. (**TBD** — drawing conventions not yet specified)

4.4. Include title blocks, legends, notes, and references per project standards. (**TBD** — standards not yet available)

4.5. Ensure dimensional accuracy and internal consistency across all drawings.

(ASSUMPTION: CAD drafting workflow based on typical EPC project practice. Cross-reference: Specification.md Quality Requirements section.)

### 5. Internal review and coordination

**Action:** Perform discipline review and coordination checks to ensure drawing completeness and consistency.

**Sub-steps:**

5.1. Conduct self-check for completeness, accuracy, and compliance with Specification requirements. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Requirements section)

5.2. Coordinate with DEL-00.02 (Technical Specification) and DEL-00.03 (Procedures) to ensure alignment. (**TBD** — coordination process not yet defined)

5.3. Perform internal discipline review for technical correctness and constructability. (**TBD** — review process not yet defined)

5.4. Resolve review comments and update drawings. (**TBD** — comment tracking process not yet defined)

(ASSUMPTION: Internal review workflow. Specific review and approval process to be confirmed from project QA/QC procedures once available.)

### 6. Issue for review/approval
