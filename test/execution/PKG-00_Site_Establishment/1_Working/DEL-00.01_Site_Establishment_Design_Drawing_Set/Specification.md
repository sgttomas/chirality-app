# Specification: DEL-00.01 Site Establishment Design Drawing Set

## Scope

This specification covers the Site Establishment Design Drawing Set for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.01, line 141)

**Package scope context:** Site establishment includes temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates for construction staging, and traffic management. (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)

**Project-level scope boundary:** This decomposition covers Contractor scope only; Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2, line 48)

**Rationale for separate package:** Temporary works enabling scope is distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The drawing set shall include the following artifacts:

1. **Site layout plan** — Overall arrangement of construction staging, laydown areas, and temporary facility locations within terminal boundaries
2. **Compound layout** — Detailed arrangement of temporary office trailers, welfare facilities, material storage compounds, equipment parking
3. **Temporary facilities location plan** — Positioning and footprints of individual temporary structures and utilities
4. **Traffic management drawings** — Construction traffic routing, access points, signage, phasing, and interface with existing terminal operations

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.01, line 141.

ASSUMPTION: Drawing scope interpretation based on typical site establishment requirements for EPC projects. Specific content requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md, Construction section)

### Technical and Performance Requirements

**Drawing completeness:**

- Each drawing shall clearly depict the scope elements listed in Deliverable Outputs above. (ASSUMPTION: Standard drawing practice)
- Drawings shall include legends, notes, and references sufficient to communicate design intent. (ASSUMPTION: Standard drawing practice)

**Coordination with project objectives:**

- Traffic management drawings shall demonstrate how construction activities minimize disruption to existing terminal commercial operations (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**TBD — Employer's Requirements content:**

- Specific layout criteria, dimensions, clearances, and constraints are not yet available in `_REFERENCES.md`. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`; decomposition Section 3, lines 75–79)

### Interface Requirements

**Interface with existing terminal operations:**

- Drawings shall identify interface points with existing terminal infrastructure and operations. (ASSUMPTION: Required to support OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity)
- **TBD** — Specific interface coordination requirements are not specified in accessible references. Dependencies are coordinated externally. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**

- ASSUMPTION: Drawing set interfaces with DEL-00.02 (Site Establishment Technical Specification) for materials and performance criteria, and DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for traffic management and site access controls. Coordination to be confirmed during working sessions. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section for coordination interfaces; Procedure.md Prerequisites section for dependency coordination)

### Quality Requirements

**Drawing standards:**

- **TBD** — CAD standards, sheet sizes, scale conventions, line weights, text styles, and symbology are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Drawing review and approval workflow requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Accuracy and consistency:**

- Drawings shall be dimensionally accurate and internally consistent. (ASSUMPTION: Standard drawing practice)
- **TBD** — Survey datum, coordinate system, and georeferencing requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable codes and standards:**

- **TBD** — No applicable standards explicitly identified in accessible references for this deliverable. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements) listed in decomposition but not yet available in this deliverable's references. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable standards for construction site drawings may include local building codes, ANSI/ASME drawing standards, and CAD standards. To be confirmed once Employer's Requirements are available.

## Verification

**Drawing review process:**

- **TBD** — Internal review, discipline coordination checks, and approval requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Employer review and acceptance criteria are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Completeness check:**

- Each drawing listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted (minimum 4 drawings). (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section for drawing list and count; Procedure.md Steps section for production workflow; Procedure.md Verification section for completeness verification)

**Consistency check:**

- Drawings shall be internally consistent and coordinated with DEL-00.02 and DEL-00.03. (Cross-reference: Procedure.md Verification section for coordination check)

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs (expected artifacts):**

1. Site layout plan
2. Compound layout
3. Temporary facilities location plan
4. Traffic management drawings

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.01, line 141. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Procedure.md Records section)

**Documentation control requirements:**

- **TBD** — Document control, numbering convention, revision management, and submittal requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Drawing register and transmittal requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
