## Conditions

**Project and scope context (applicable to site establishment drawings):**

- Temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, traffic management. (Source: `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Design and environmental conditions:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- **TBD** — Site-specific design conditions (climate, soil, loadings) not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Existing terminal operational constraints not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated drawing contents (expected artifacts):**

- Site layout plan
- Compound layout
- Temporary facilities location plan
- Traffic management drawings

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.01, line 141.

**Drawing content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- Site layout plan: Overall arrangement of construction staging, laydown areas, and temporary facility locations within terminal boundaries
- Compound layout: Detailed arrangement of temporary office trailers, welfare facilities, material storage compounds, equipment parking
- Temporary facilities location plan: Positioning and footprints of individual temporary structures and utilities
- Traffic management drawings: Construction traffic routing, access points, signage, phasing, and interface with existing terminal operations

(ASSUMPTION: Specific drawing content requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)

**Materials/configuration:**

- **TBD** — Drawing content details, annotation standards, and symbology depend on Employer's Requirements and project CAD/drafting standards not yet provided. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`; decomposition Section 3 reference list, lines 75–79)
