# Specification: DEL-00.05 Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for the Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission deliverable within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145)

**Deliverable purpose:** Defines the planned approach and controls for road access configuration & security process submission to meet ER requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The planning documentation shall include the following artifacts (minimum 3 plans/procedures):

1. **Road access configuration plan** — Planned configuration of road access to construction site including entry/exit points, routing within site and terminal, interface with public roads, coordination with terminal operational traffic, signage and controls, and authority approval requirements

2. **Security access process** — Process for controlling personnel and vehicle access to construction site including badging, visitor management, Employer coordination, emergency access, and compliance with terminal security requirements

3. **Gate control procedures** — Procedures for operating security gates including staffing, hours of operation, vehicle inspection, sign-in/out protocols, and incident response

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145.

ASSUMPTION: Plan scope interpretation based on typical site access and security planning for EPC projects at operating facilities. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section)

### Planning Requirements

**Road access configuration:**
- Define site access points (entry and exit gates)
- Plan routing for construction traffic within terminal boundaries
- Coordinate with terminal operational traffic to minimize conflicts (OBJ-5)
- Identify interface with public roads and authority approval requirements
- Plan signage, traffic controls, and safety measures
- **TBD** — Specific routing constraints, authority approval procedures, and terminal coordination protocols not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Security access process:**
- Define badging and visitor sign-in procedures
- Plan coordination with terminal security systems and personnel
- Define emergency access protocols
- Ensure compliance with terminal security requirements
- **TBD** — Specific terminal security protocols, badging systems, and coordination procedures not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Gate control procedures:**
- Define gate staffing requirements and hours of operation
- Define vehicle inspection protocols
- Define sign-in/out procedures and record-keeping
- Define incident response procedures
- **TBD** — Specific gate control standards and procedures not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Coordination Requirements

**OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity coordination:**
- Road access configuration shall minimize disruption to terminal operational traffic. (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63)
- Security processes shall integrate with existing terminal security without creating gaps or conflicts.
- Gate operations shall accommodate both construction and terminal operational needs.

**Authority coordination:**
- Plans shall address approval requirements from applicable authorities (TransLink, City of Surrey, Port Authority). (ASSUMPTION: Likely approval authorities)
- **TBD** — Specific authority requirements and approval processes not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**
- ASSUMPTION: Plans interface with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for physical gate and road layouts, and DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for traffic management and site access procedures. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section; Procedure.md Prerequisites section)

### Quality Requirements

- Plans shall be clear, complete, and executable
- Plans shall be coordinated with Employer, terminal operations, and applicable authorities
- **TBD** — Specific review and approval requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable standards and regulations:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1) listed in decomposition but not yet available. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable requirements may include:
- BC Motor Vehicle Act and Commercial Transport Regulations
- City of Surrey road use permits and traffic management requirements
- Port Authority security and access requirements
- Terminal-specific security protocols

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- All three plans/procedures listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Verification section)

**Coordination check:**
- Plans shall be coordinated with terminal operations, authorities, site layout, and traffic management procedures. (Cross-reference: Procedure.md Verification section)

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs:**

1. Road access configuration plan
2. Security access process
3. Gate control procedures

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Procedure.md Records section; Guidance.md Examples section)
