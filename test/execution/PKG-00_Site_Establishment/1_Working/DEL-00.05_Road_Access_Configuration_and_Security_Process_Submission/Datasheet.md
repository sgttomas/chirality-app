## Conditions

**Project and scope context:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Deliverable intent:**

- Defines the planned approach and controls for road access configuration & security process submission to meet ER requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145)

**Operational context:**

- Plans shall support minimizing disruption to existing terminal commercial operations (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)
- **TBD** — Existing terminal road network, access points, security protocols, and authority requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated plan artifacts:**

- Road access configuration plan
- Security access process
- Gate control procedures

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145.

**Plan content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Road access configuration plan:** Planned configuration of road access to construction site including entry/exit points, routing within site and terminal, interface with public roads, coordination with terminal operational traffic, signage and controls, and authority approval requirements
- **Security access process:** Process for controlling personnel and vehicle access to construction site including badging, visitor management, Employer coordination, emergency access, and compliance with terminal security requirements
- **Gate control procedures:** Procedures for operating security gates including staffing, hours of operation, vehicle inspection, sign-in/out protocols, and incident response

(ASSUMPTION: Typical access control planning for EPC construction at operating terminals. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)
