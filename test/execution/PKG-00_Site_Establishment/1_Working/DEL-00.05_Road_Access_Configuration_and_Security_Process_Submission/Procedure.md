# Procedure: DEL-00.05 Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission deliverable (minimum 3 plans/procedures) for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section)

This procedure covers planning, coordination, and submission of access control documentation to support safe, secure construction execution and terminal continuity. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Guidance.md Purpose section)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

ASSUMPTION: Likely prerequisite deliverables and inputs include:
- Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements)
- DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for physical gate and road layouts
- DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for traffic management plan and site access procedure
- Terminal security protocols and existing access control procedures
- Authority requirements and approval procedures (TransLink, City of Surrey, Port Authority)

**Required inputs:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Terminal road network diagrams and operational traffic data not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Terminal security protocols and coordination procedures not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Authority requirements and approval procedures not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Steps

### 1. Collect inputs and constraints

**Action:** Gather available information on terminal access, security, and authority requirements.

**Sub-steps:**
1.1. Obtain terminal road network diagrams and access point information from Employer
1.2. Obtain terminal security protocols and coordination procedures from Employer
1.3. Obtain Employer's Requirements for road access and security requirements
1.4. Identify applicable authorities and obtain approval requirements
1.5. Coordinate with DEL-00.01 team to understand physical gate and road layout plans
1.6. Coordinate with DEL-00.03 team to understand traffic management and site access procedure plans
1.7. Identify missing inputs and mark as **TBD**

(ASSUMPTION: Input collection workflow. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section)

### 2. Develop road access configuration plan

**Action:** Plan road access configuration including entry/exit points, routing, and authority approvals.

**Sub-steps:**
2.1. Identify candidate site entry/exit locations based on site layout, terminal constraints, and public road access
2.2. Plan routing for construction traffic within terminal (trucks, light vehicles, personnel)
2.3. Coordinate routing with terminal operational traffic to minimize conflicts (OBJ-5)
2.4. Identify required signage, pavement markings, and traffic controls
2.5. Identify interface with public roads and authority approval requirements
2.6. Prepare road access configuration plan document including diagrams, routing descriptions, coordination protocols, and approval strategy
2.7. Coordinate plan with Employer and terminal operations for feedback

### 3. Develop security access process

**Action:** Define process for controlling personnel and vehicle access to construction site.

**Sub-steps:**
3.1. Define badging system (types, application procedures, issuance, color coding)
3.2. Define visitor sign-in procedures (ID verification, safety briefing, escort requirements)
3.3. Define coordination with terminal security (badge compatibility, incident reporting, emergency response)
3.4. Define background check or security clearance requirements (if applicable)
3.5. Define after-hours and emergency access protocols
3.6. Define lost badge procedures and access revocation protocols
3.7. Prepare security access process document
3.8. Coordinate process with Employer terminal security team for integration

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Planning Requirements section; Guidance.md Security access process development)

### 4. Develop gate control procedures

**Action:** Define procedures for operating security gates.

**Sub-steps:**
4.1. Define gate locations, types, and operating hours based on site layout and security requirements
4.2. Define gate staffing requirements and schedules
4.3. Define vehicle inspection protocols (insurance verification, cargo inspection, safety equipment checks)
4.4. Define sign-in/out procedures and log formats
4.5. Define incident response procedures (unauthorized access, conflicts, emergencies)
4.6. Define reporting to project management and Employer
4.7. Prepare gate control procedures document
4.8. Coordinate procedures with security staffing vendor (if applicable) and Employer

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Planning Requirements section; Guidance.md Gate control procedures development)

### 5. Coordinate with authorities and stakeholders

**Action:** Review plans with authorities and stakeholders and obtain approvals.

**Sub-steps:**
5.1. Submit road access configuration plan to applicable authorities for review/approval (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
5.2. Coordinate with Employer terminal operations to confirm access and security plans are acceptable
5.3. Coordinate with DEL-00.01 and DEL-00.03 teams to ensure alignment
5.4. Address review comments and update plans as needed
5.5. Obtain final approvals from authorities and Employer

(Cross-reference: Guidance.md Dependencies and coordination)

### 6. Issue planning documentation

**Action:** Submit road access configuration and security process documentation per project document control process.

**Sub-steps:**
6.1. Prepare transmittal package including all three plans/procedures (**TBD** — transmittal format not specified)
6.2. Submit to project document control system (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
6.3. Distribute to Employer, authorities, and project stakeholders

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- Confirm all three plans/procedures have been produced and submitted. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

**Coordination check:**
- Verify coordination with terminal operations, authorities, site layout, and traffic management procedures

**OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity check:**
- Verify road access configuration minimizes disruption to terminal operational traffic. (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Cross-reference: Specification.md Coordination Requirements section; Guidance.md Principles section)
- Verify security processes integrate with terminal security without creating gaps

**Approval check:**
- Verify required authority approvals have been obtained or are in process
