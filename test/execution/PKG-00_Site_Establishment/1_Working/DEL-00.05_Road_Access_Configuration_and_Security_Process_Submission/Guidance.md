# Guidance: DEL-00.05 Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Road Access Configuration & Security Process Submission, which defines the planned approach and controls for road access configuration & security process submission to meet ER requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.05, line 145)

This deliverable establishes the framework for controlled, secure access to the construction site while supporting terminal continuity. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Purpose section)

## Principles

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Access planning implications:**
- Road access configuration should separate construction and terminal operational traffic where feasible
- Access points should be positioned to avoid interference with cargo handling operations
- Security processes should integrate seamlessly with existing terminal security systems
- Gate operations should accommodate terminal operational schedules and emergency access needs

(ASSUMPTION: Typical considerations for access planning at operating terminals.)

### Integration with terminal security

Security processes and gate controls must integrate with terminal security protocols and personnel. Coordinate early and comprehensively to ensure consistent, gap-free security coverage. (ASSUMPTION: Required for operating terminal security)

### Authority compliance

Road access configuration affecting public roads requires coordination with and approval from applicable authorities. Plan sufficient time for approval processes. (ASSUMPTION: Typical regulatory requirement)

## Considerations

### Road access configuration planning

**Road access configuration plan** — Consider:
- Number and location of site entry/exit points (minimize to reduce security burden; maximize to reduce congestion)
- Routing for different vehicle types (heavy trucks, light vehicles, personnel)
- Interface with public roads (Elevator Road and other terminal access roads)
- Separation or coordination with terminal operational traffic
- Signage, pavement markings, and traffic controls
- Authority approval requirements (road use permits, traffic management plans)
- Phasing as construction progresses and site boundaries change

(Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Specification.md Planning Requirements section)

### Security access process development

**Security access process** — Consider:
- Badging system (types, color coding, photo ID requirements)
- Visitor sign-in procedures (ID verification, safety briefing, escort requirements)
- Coordination with terminal security (badge compatibility, incident reporting, emergency response)
- Background checks or security clearances (if required by terminal or Port Authority)
- After-hours and emergency access protocols
- Lost badge procedures and access revocation

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Planning Requirements section)

### Gate control procedures development

**Gate control procedures** — Consider:
- Gate locations and types (swing gates, sliding gates, boom barriers)
- Staffing (security guards, gate attendants, schedules)
- Hours of operation (24/7, business hours, on-call)
- Vehicle inspection protocols (insurance verification, cargo inspection, safety equipment checks)
- Sign-in/out logs and record retention
- Incident response (unauthorized access attempts, emergencies, conflicts)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Planning Requirements section)

### Reference materials

- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements, terminal security protocols, existing road network diagrams, and authority requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Dependencies and coordination

- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for physical gate and road layouts
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for traffic management plan and site access procedure
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with Employer terminal security and operations teams
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with applicable authorities (TransLink, City of Surrey, Port Authority) for approvals

## Trade-offs

### Security rigor: stringent vs. expedient

**Consideration:** Stringent security (thorough inspections, extensive documentation, limited access) provides better control but slows access and increases staffing costs. Expedient security (minimal checks, streamlined processes) reduces burden but may create security gaps.

**Guidance:** Balance security rigor with operational efficiency. For operating terminals, err toward more stringent security to protect terminal operations and comply with Port Authority requirements. Coordinate with Employer to understand terminal security standards.

### Access points: single gate vs. multiple gates

**Consideration:** Single gate provides centralized control and reduces security staffing but may create congestion. Multiple gates distribute traffic but increase security staffing and coordination complexity.

**Guidance:** Evaluate based on expected traffic volumes, terminal operational constraints, and available staffing. For large EPC projects, multiple gates (e.g., main gate for personnel, separate truck gate for deliveries) may be warranted. Coordinate with terminal operations to understand constraints (OBJ-5).

### Gate staffing: full-time vs. on-call

**Consideration:** Full-time gate staffing provides consistent access control but increases costs. On-call or periodic staffing reduces costs but may delay access or create security gaps.

**Guidance:** Align staffing with project activity levels and terminal security requirements. During peak mobilization or active construction, full-time staffing may be necessary. During low-activity phases, reduced staffing may suffice. Coordinate with Employer to understand terminal expectations.

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and terminal security protocols are available.

## Examples

### Anticipated artifacts

1. **Road access configuration plan** — Routing diagrams, access point locations, authority approval strategy
2. **Security access process** — Badging procedures, visitor management, coordination protocols
3. **Gate control procedures** — Gate operations, staffing, inspection checklists, incident response
