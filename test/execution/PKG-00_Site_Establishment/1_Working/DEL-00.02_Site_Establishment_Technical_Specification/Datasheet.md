## Conditions

**Project and scope context (applicable to site establishment specifications):**

- Temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, traffic management. (Source: `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Design and environmental conditions:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- **TBD** — Site-specific design conditions (climate, soil, loadings) not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Existing terminal operational constraints affecting temporary works construction not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Performance context:**

- Specifications shall define requirements sufficient to support safe, reliable temporary works for construction duration. (ASSUMPTION: Standard specification practice)
- **TBD** — Construction duration and lifecycle requirements for temporary facilities not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated specification contents (expected artifacts):**

- Temporary facilities specification
- Temporary utilities specification

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.02, line 142.

**Specification content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Temporary facilities specification:** Performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for temporary offices, welfare facilities (washrooms, break rooms), storage buildings, equipment shelters, security fencing, gates, and access control infrastructure
- **Temporary utilities specification:** Performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for temporary electrical service, water supply, sanitary sewer/septic, drainage, telecommunications, and other construction-phase utilities

(ASSUMPTION: Typical specification content for EPC construction site establishment. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)

**Materials/configuration:**

- **TBD** — Specification content details, performance criteria, material standards, and workmanship requirements depend on Employer's Requirements and project standards not yet provided. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`; decomposition Section 3 reference list, lines 75–79)
