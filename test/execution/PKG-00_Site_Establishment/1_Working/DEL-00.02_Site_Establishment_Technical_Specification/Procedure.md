# Procedure: DEL-00.02 Site Establishment Technical Specification

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Site Establishment Technical Specification (minimum 2 specifications) for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section for document count)

This procedure covers the workflow from initial input collection through specification issuance, ensuring compliance with project requirements and support for OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section for project objectives; Guidance.md Principles section for Terminal Continuity specification implications)

  - Section 3: Execution (site preparation, installation, connections, testing, commissioning, maintenance)

- **Temporary utilities specification:**
  - Section 1: General (scope, references, submittals, quality assurance)
  - Section 2: Products (electrical panels/transformers, water pipe/backflow preventers, sewer/septic equipment, drainage components, telecommunications equipment)
  - Section 3: Execution (routing, installation, connections, testing, commissioning, winterization, decommissioning)

(ASSUMPTION: Typical three-part CSI specification format. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Examples section. Specific organization to be confirmed from project specification standards once available.)

### 3. Develop performance, materials, and workmanship requirements

**Action:** Populate specification requirements incorporating project constraints and Terminal Continuity objective (OBJ-5).

**Sub-steps:**

3.1. Define performance requirements:
- Capacity, service levels, reliability criteria for each facility/utility type
- Operational continuity requirements (minimize disruption to terminal operations per OBJ-5)
- Safety, accessibility, and code compliance requirements

3.2. Define materials requirements:
- Material standards, grades, and approved manufacturers
- Product data and submittal requirements
- Quality verification (certifications, testing, warranties)

3.3. Define workmanship requirements:
- Installation standards, tolerances, and procedures
- Interface coordination and tie-in procedures
- Inspection, testing, and acceptance criteria

3.4. Coordinate requirements with Employer to confirm operational constraints and interface requirements. (**TBD** — coordination process not yet defined)

3.5. Refine requirements based on Employer feedback and coordination with other deliverables (DEL-00.01, DEL-00.03). (**TBD** — coordination process not yet defined)
