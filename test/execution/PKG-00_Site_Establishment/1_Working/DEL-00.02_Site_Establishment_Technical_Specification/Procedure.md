# Procedure: DEL-00.02 Site Establishment Technical Specification

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Site Establishment Technical Specification for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`)

## Prerequisites

- **Dependencies:** NOT_TRACKED. Dependencies are coordinated externally by humans. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)
- **Reference materials:** **TBD** — No references identified for this deliverable yet. Employer's Requirements are listed at project level but not available in this deliverable's references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`; decomposition Section 3)

## Steps

ASSUMPTION: A typical specification development workflow will be refined once Employer's Requirements and project QA/QC procedures are available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

1. **Collect inputs** — Gather available project inputs and constraints for site establishment; confirm missing inputs as **TBD**. (ASSUMPTION; Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
2. **Define content structure** — Align the specification sections with anticipated artifacts (temporary facilities specification, temporary utilities specification). (ASSUMPTION; Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.02)
3. **Draft requirements** — Populate performance, materials, and workmanship requirements as sources become available. (ASSUMPTION; Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
4. **Internal review** — Perform discipline review and coordination checks. (ASSUMPTION; Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
5. **Issue for review** — Submit the specification per project document control process. (ASSUMPTION; Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Verification

- **TBD** — Verification and review requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Records

**Records / outputs:**

- Temporary facilities specification
- Temporary utilities specification

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.02.

**Record control:**

- **TBD** — Record control and retention requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
