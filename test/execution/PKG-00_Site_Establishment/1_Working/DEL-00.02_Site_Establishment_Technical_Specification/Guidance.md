# Guidance: DEL-00.02 Site Establishment Technical Specification

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Site Establishment Technical Specification, which defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for site establishment per Employer's Requirements. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.02, line 142)

This deliverable establishes the technical requirements for temporary works construction, ensuring facilities and utilities are fit for purpose while supporting terminal continuity. The specification set (minimum 2 specifications) defines the "what" and "how well" for site establishment construction. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section for project objectives; Datasheet.md Attributes section for document count and list; Procedure.md Purpose section for development process)

## Principles

### Scope alignment

The specification should reflect the site establishment scope: temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates, and traffic management. (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)

Temporary works enabling scope is distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Specification implications:**

- Performance requirements should address operational continuity (minimize outages, disruptions, or safety risks to terminal operations)
- Material selection should consider rapid installation, minimal invasiveness, and ease of future removal
- Workmanship standards should emphasize safety, cleanliness, and orderly execution to avoid operational interference
- Interface requirements should clearly define tie-in procedures that minimize terminal downtime

(ASSUMPTION: Typical considerations for temporary works specifications at operating terminals. Specific constraints to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and site coordination meetings.)

### Contractor scope boundary

Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections; the specification should avoid assuming Employer-furnished materials or scope unless interfaces are explicitly required. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2, line 48)

ASSUMPTION: Employer-furnished items may include utility connection points, access permits, or existing infrastructure. Interface specification to be confirmed once Employer's Requirements are available.

### Specification clarity and enforceability

Each specification should contain clear, measurable, and enforceable requirements. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Quality Requirements section)

- Use mandatory language ("shall") for requirements; use advisory language ("should") for guidance
- Define performance criteria quantitatively where possible (capacities, service levels, tolerances)
- Reference specific standards, codes, or approved products rather than vague general statements
- Ensure requirements are verifiable through inspection, testing, or documentation review

(ASSUMPTION: Standard specification writing practice for EPC projects)

## Considerations

### Specification structure and content

Ensure the specification content aligns with the anticipated artifacts:

1. **Temporary facilities specification** — Consider:
   - Building types and sizes (office trailers, storage sheds, equipment shelters)
   - Structural and foundation requirements (wind, snow, seismic, soil bearing)
   - Utilities services (electrical, water, HVAC, communications)
   - Accessibility, egress, and life safety (codes, permits)
   - Security fencing, gates, lighting, signage
   - Finishes and amenities (welfare facilities, furniture, equipment)
   - Maintenance and winterization requirements

2. **Temporary utilities specification** — Consider:
   - Electrical service (capacity, voltage, distribution, grounding, connections)
   - Water supply (potable, fire protection, backflow prevention, winterization)
   - Sanitary sewer/septic (capacity, treatment, discharge permits)
   - Drainage (site runoff, erosion control, sediment management)
   - Telecommunications (phone, internet, security systems)
   - Service installation, testing, commissioning, and decommissioning requirements

### Reference materials

Employer's Requirements are listed as reference documents but are not yet available in this deliverable's references; requirements should be treated as **TBD** until provided. (Source: decomposition Section 3, lines 75–79; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: When Employer's Requirements become available, review for:

- Specific performance criteria (office headcount, storage volumes, utility capacities)
- Material preferences or approved products
- Workmanship standards and QA/QC requirements
- Interface requirements with existing terminal systems
- Environmental, safety, and permitting requirements affecting temporary works

### Dependencies and coordination

Dependencies are coordinated externally in NOT_TRACKED mode; confirm required inputs with the human or coordination process. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Likely coordination interfaces include:

- DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) — alignment on layout, arrangement, and dimensional requirements
- DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) — alignment on execution methods, QA/QC, and safety requirements
- Design criteria and load calculations (structural, electrical, plumbing)
- Employer's utility tie-in specifications and interface requirements

### Project location context

Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)

ASSUMPTION: Site-specific considerations may include:

- Local climate (rainfall, seasonal temperatures affecting HVAC, insulation, winterization)
- Soil conditions (bearing capacity, drainage, frost depth affecting foundations)
- Local codes and authorities having jurisdiction (building permits, electrical permits, plumbing permits)
- Proximity to waterfront and environmental sensitivities (drainage, spill prevention)

(Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and site investigation.)

### Specification organization

**TBD** — Specification organization system (CSI MasterFormat, custom section numbering, or other) not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical approaches for temporary works specifications include:

- Integrated single specification document with major sections for facilities and utilities
- Separate specification documents for each major category (facilities vs. utilities)
- Subsections organized by system or component type

(Organization to be confirmed from project specification standards once available.)

## Trade-offs

### Performance level: minimal vs. semi-permanent

**Consideration:** Temporary works can range from minimal/expedient installations to semi-permanent, high-quality facilities.

**Guidance:** Specify performance appropriate for construction duration and site conditions. Avoid over-specifying (adding cost and complexity) or under-specifying (creating safety, reliability, or operational risks). Balance first cost against lifecycle costs (maintenance, winterization, future expansion/relocation).

(ASSUMPTION: Trade-off between cost, quality, and operational robustness. Specific approach to be confirmed during design development.)

### Standardization vs. customization

**Consideration:** Standardized materials and systems (modular buildings, packaged utilities) offer faster procurement and installation but may not perfectly fit site constraints. Custom-designed solutions offer better fit but add engineering and fabrication time.

**Guidance:** Prefer standardized, off-the-shelf solutions where feasible (office trailers, packaged electrical panels) to reduce schedule risk. Specify custom solutions only where site constraints or operational requirements mandate them.

(ASSUMPTION: Typical procurement strategy for EPC projects. Specific preferences to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements and project execution strategy.)

### Quality vs. schedule

**Consideration:** Higher quality standards (material grades, workmanship tolerances, inspection/testing rigor) provide better reliability but may extend installation schedules.

**Guidance:** Balance quality requirements with project schedule constraints. For temporary works, prioritize safety and functional adequacy over aesthetic finishes. Specify acceptance criteria that can be verified rapidly (visual inspection, functional testing) rather than extensive lab testing where practical.

(ASSUMPTION: Quality/schedule trade-off guidance. Specific requirements to be confirmed from project QA/QC plan and schedule once available.)

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and site-specific constraints are available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
