# Specification: DEL-00.02 Site Establishment Technical Specification

## Scope

This specification defines performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for site establishment within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.02, line 142)

**Package scope context:** Site establishment includes temporary offices, storage, laydown areas, temporary utilities, security fencing and gates for construction staging, and traffic management. (Source: decomposition Section 5, PKG-00 scope, line 135)

**Project-level scope boundary:** This decomposition covers Contractor scope only; Employer-responsible items are excluded except for interface connections. (Source: decomposition Section 1.2, line 48)

**Rationale for separate package:** Temporary works enabling scope is distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The technical specification shall include the following artifacts (minimum 2 specifications):

1. **Temporary facilities specification** — Performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for temporary offices, welfare facilities, storage buildings, equipment shelters, security fencing, gates, and access control infrastructure

2. **Temporary utilities specification** — Performance, materials, and workmanship requirements for temporary electrical service, water supply, sanitary sewer/septic, drainage, telecommunications, and other construction-phase utilities

**Interface with existing terminal operations:**

- Temporary works shall interface with existing terminal infrastructure and utilities as required while minimizing operational disruption (OBJ-5). (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63)
- **TBD** — Specific interface coordination requirements, tie-in procedures, and operational constraints are not specified in accessible references. Dependencies are coordinated externally. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**

- ASSUMPTION: Technical specification interfaces with DEL-00.01 (Site Establishment Design Drawing Set) for layout, arrangement, and dimensional requirements, and DEL-00.03 (Site Establishment Procedures) for execution methods, QA/QC, and safety requirements. Coordination to be confirmed during working sessions. (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section for coordination interfaces; Procedure.md Prerequisites section for dependency coordination; Procedure.md Verification section for coordination check)

### Quality Requirements

**Specification quality:**

- Specifications shall be clear, complete, and enforceable. (ASSUMPTION: Standard specification practice)
- Requirements shall be verifiable through inspection, testing, or documentation review. (ASSUMPTION: Standard specification practice)
- **TBD** — Specification review and approval workflow requirements are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Construction quality:**

- **TBD** — Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) requirements, inspection hold points, and acceptance criteria are not specified in accessible references. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable codes and standards:**

- **TBD** — No applicable standards explicitly identified in accessible references for this deliverable. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1: General Requirements) listed in decomposition but not yet available in this deliverable's references. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable standards for temporary construction facilities may include:
