# Guidance: DEL-00.07 Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report

## Purpose

Provide guidance for preparing the Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report, which documents analysis and results for post-works road condition survey report required for design verification and approvals. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147)

This deliverable documents post-construction road conditions, compares to DEL-00.06 baseline, identifies construction-induced damage, and demonstrates appropriate restoration to support terminal continuity. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Purpose section)

## Principles

### Terminal continuity (OBJ-5)

This deliverable is mapped to OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

**Post-construction survey and closeout implications:**
- Efficient completion of survey, restoration, and closeout minimizes prolonged impact on terminal
- Fair damage attribution and appropriate restoration avoid disputes that could affect terminal operations
- Timely approval and sign-off enables return to normal terminal road use without restrictions

(ASSUMPTION: Post-construction survey and closeout support terminal continuity by enabling efficient, fair resolution of road condition obligations.)

### Comparison validity

Survey methodology must be consistent with DEL-00.06 baseline to enable valid comparison. Use same survey area, condition rating system, and photographic protocol. (Cross-reference: DEL-00.06 for baseline methodology)

### Fair damage attribution

Distinguish construction-induced damage from pre-existing defects (documented in DEL-00.06) and normal deterioration during construction period. Base attributions on evidence (baseline comparison, traffic records, timing of defect appearance).

## Considerations

### Survey planning

**Survey timing:**
- Conduct survey after construction demobilization and site restoration (temporary works removed)
- Allow sufficient time after last construction traffic for accurate assessment
- Schedule to minimize interference with terminal operations
- Allow sufficient time for post-survey restoration and closeout before project final completion

**Survey consistency with DEL-00.06:**
- Use same survey area limits and segment boundaries
- Use same condition rating system and definitions
- Use same photographic locations/stations for before/after comparison
- Use same or equivalent surveyor for consistency

(Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Conditions section; Specification.md Survey Requirements section; DEL-00.06 for baseline methodology)

### Survey execution and comparison

**Post-construction survey approach:**
- Follow same systematic approach as DEL-00.06 (traverse routes, rate conditions, document defects, photograph)
- Record survey date, weather, personnel
- Note any unusual conditions affecting comparison (recent maintenance by others, weather events, etc.)

**Baseline comparison approach:**
- Compare post-construction conditions to DEL-00.06 baseline segment-by-segment
- Identify changes: new defects, worsened defects, improved conditions (if any)
- Attribute changes: construction-induced vs. pre-existing vs. normal deterioration
- Use evidence for attributions: if defect appears in same location as DEL-00.06, likely pre-existing; if new location with heavy construction traffic, likely construction-induced

**Photographic comparison:**
- Take photos at same locations as DEL-00.06 baseline
- Use consistent orientation and framing where possible
- Consider side-by-side or before/after presentation in photo log for clarity

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Survey Requirements section; Procedure.md Steps section)

### Deficiency identification and restoration

**Deficiency list development:**
- Compile all identified construction-induced damage items
- Prioritize by severity and impact on road functionality
- Coordinate with Employer on restoration approach (repair, compensation, acceptance as-is)

**Restoration execution:**
- Repair defects per applicable standards (local authority road specifications)
- Document restoration work (work orders, photos, material certifications)
- Obtain inspections and acceptance (Employer, authorities if applicable)

**Closeout documentation:**
- Prepare deficiency closeout package showing all items resolved
- Obtain Employer/authority sign-off
- Retain records for project closeout and warranty period

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Procedure.md Steps section)

### Reference materials

- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements, restoration standards, and acceptance criteria not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- DEL-00.06 Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report (baseline for comparison)

### Dependencies and coordination

- ASSUMPTION: Survey must reference DEL-00.06 baseline survey and use consistent methodology
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with Employer for deficiency resolution approach and approval
- ASSUMPTION: Coordinate with authorities (if applicable) for final road acceptance

## Trade-offs

### Survey timing: early vs. late in closeout

**Consideration:** Early survey (immediately after demobilization) provides quick deficiency identification but may miss latent damage. Late survey (closer to project completion) captures all damage but delays deficiency resolution.

**Guidance:** Conduct survey reasonably soon after demobilization to allow time for restoration before project completion, but not so early that temporary works or equipment are still affecting roads. Typical timing: within 1-2 weeks after last construction traffic.

### Damage attribution: conservative vs. aggressive

**Consideration:** Conservative attribution (attribute questionable items to construction) increases restoration cost but reduces dispute risk. Aggressive attribution (attribute to pre-existing or normal deterioration) reduces restoration cost but increases dispute risk.

**Guidance:** Use evidence-based attribution. Where baseline survey clearly shows pre-existing defect, attribute to pre-existing. Where new defect appears in heavily trafficked area, attribute to construction. For borderline cases, discuss with Employer for mutual agreement before finalizing attribution.

### Restoration scope: full repair vs. negotiated settlement

**Consideration:** Full repair restores roads to baseline condition but may be costly. Negotiated settlement (partial repair, monetary compensation, acceptance as-is) may be more cost-effective if roads remain functional and Employer accepts.

**Guidance:** Prioritize restoration based on severity and functional impact. Significant structural defects (potholes, settlements, major cracking) warrant full repair. Minor cosmetic issues may be candidates for negotiated settlement if Employer agrees.

**TBD** — Additional trade-offs may emerge once Employer's Requirements and restoration standards are available.
