# Specification: DEL-00.07 Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for the Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report deliverable within PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147)

**Deliverable purpose:** Documents analysis and results for post-works road condition survey report required for design verification and approvals. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147)

**Project objectives:** This deliverable supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity: "The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities." (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)

By documenting post-construction conditions, identifying construction-induced damage, and demonstrating appropriate restoration, this survey enables terminal operations to continue without prolonged road condition disputes.

## Requirements

### Deliverable Outputs

The survey documentation shall include the following artifacts (minimum 3 documents):

1. **Post-construction road condition survey report** — Documented post-construction condition of access roads and haul routes (same survey area as DEL-00.06), comparison to baseline survey showing changes, identification of construction-induced damage, and recommendations for restoration

2. **Photo log** — Comprehensive photographic record of post-construction road conditions using same locations/stations as DEL-00.06 baseline for direct comparison

3. **Deficiency closeout** — Documentation of identified construction-induced damage, restoration actions taken, acceptance by Employer/authorities, and sign-off of road condition obligations

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147.

ASSUMPTION: Report scope interpretation based on typical post-construction road condition survey and closeout practice. Specific requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section)

### Survey Requirements

**Survey area:**
- Document condition of same roads surveyed in DEL-00.06 baseline survey
- Use same survey limits and segment boundaries for valid comparison
- **TBD** — Specific survey area and comparison methodology not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Survey methodology:**
- Use same survey methodology as DEL-00.06 for valid comparison (visual inspection, condition rating system, photographic protocol)
- Document post-construction conditions systematically
- Compare to DEL-00.06 baseline to identify changes
- Distinguish construction-induced damage from pre-existing defects or normal deterioration
- **TBD** — Specific comparison methodology and damage attribution criteria not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Survey timing:**
- Survey shall be conducted after construction demobilization and site restoration
- Coordinate survey timing with Employer and authorities
- Allow sufficient time for post-survey restoration and deficiency closeout before project closeout
- **TBD** — Specific survey timing and approval requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Reporting Requirements

**Post-construction road condition survey report content:**
- Executive summary of post-construction conditions and construction impacts
- Survey area, methodology (reference DEL-00.06 for consistency)
- Post-construction condition for each road segment
- Comparison to DEL-00.06 baseline (changes, new defects, construction-induced damage)
- Analysis of damage attribution (construction vs. pre-existing vs. normal deterioration)
- Restoration recommendations
- Photo log cross-reference
- Appendices: comparison tables, deficiency list

**Photo log content:**
- Photographic coverage of same locations as DEL-00.06 baseline for direct comparison
- Side-by-side or before/after presentation where helpful
- Documentation of new defects or changes
- **TBD** — Specific photo comparison format not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Deficiency closeout content:**
- List of construction-induced damage items
- Restoration actions taken (repairs, compensation, Employer acceptance of as-is condition)
- Documentation of restoration (work orders, photos, inspection records)
- Employer/authority sign-off and acceptance
- **TBD** — Specific closeout documentation requirements and approval process not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

### Coordination Requirements

**OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity coordination:**
- Complete survey, restoration, and closeout efficiently to avoid prolonged impact on terminal operations
- Coordinate restoration work to minimize further disruption to terminal
- Obtain timely approvals to close out road condition obligations

**Authority coordination:**
- Coordinate with applicable road authorities (City of Surrey, TransLink, Port Authority) for post-construction acceptance
- **TBD** — Authority coordination and approval requirements not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

**Interface with other deliverables:**
- Survey shall reference and compare to DEL-00.06 baseline survey (Cross-reference: Guidance.md Considerations section; Procedure.md Prerequisites section)

### Quality Requirements

- Survey shall be conducted by same or equivalent qualified surveyor as DEL-00.06
- Survey methodology shall be consistent with DEL-00.06 for valid comparison
- Damage attribution shall be fair and evidence-based
- Restoration shall meet applicable standards
- **TBD** — Specific restoration standards and acceptance criteria not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Standards

**Applicable standards:**
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 Part 1) listed in decomposition but not yet available. (Source: decomposition Section 3, line 77; `_REFERENCES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Typical applicable standards may include:
- Same survey standards as DEL-00.06 (ASTM, local authority rating systems)
- Road restoration and repair standards (local authority specifications)

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- All three documents listed in Deliverable Outputs shall be produced and submitted. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Procedure.md Verification section)

**Comparison validity check:**
- Verify survey methodology is consistent with DEL-00.06 baseline
- Verify comparison identifies changes and attributes damage fairly

**Closeout check:**
- Verify all identified construction-induced damage is restored or otherwise resolved
- Verify Employer/authority acceptance is obtained

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs:**

1. Post-construction road condition survey report
2. Photo log
3. Deficiency closeout

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Construction section; Procedure.md Records section; Guidance.md Examples section)
