# Procedure: DEL-00.07 Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report

## Purpose

Describe the process to produce the Post-Works Road Condition Survey Report deliverable (minimum 3 documents) for PKG-00 Site Establishment. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section)

This procedure covers post-construction survey, baseline comparison, deficiency identification, restoration, and closeout. (Cross-reference: Specification.md Scope section; Guidance.md Purpose section)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

NOT_TRACKED. Dependencies are coordinated externally by humans. (Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

ASSUMPTION: Likely prerequisite deliverables and inputs include:
- DEL-00.06 Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report (baseline for comparison)
- Construction demobilization complete (site restored, temporary works removed)
- Restoration standards and acceptance criteria from Employer/authorities

### Reference materials

**Required inputs:**
- DEL-00.06 Pre-Works Road Condition Survey Report (baseline survey and photo log)
- **TBD** — Employer's Requirements not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)
- **TBD** — Restoration standards and acceptance criteria not yet available. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Steps

### 1. Plan post-construction survey

**Action:** Define survey scope, methodology (consistent with DEL-00.06), and schedule.

**Sub-steps:**
1.1. Review DEL-00.06 baseline survey to understand survey area, methodology, and baseline conditions
1.2. Confirm survey area, segments, and photographic locations match DEL-00.06 for valid comparison
1.3. Confirm same condition rating system will be used
1.4. Schedule survey after construction demobilization and site restoration
1.5. Coordinate survey access with Employer terminal operations (OBJ-5)
1.6. Prepare survey forms and photo log templates (same format as DEL-00.06)

(ASSUMPTION: Survey planning workflow. Cross-reference: Guidance.md Survey planning)

### 2. Conduct post-construction survey

**Action:** Execute visual inspection and photographic documentation of post-construction road conditions.

**Sub-steps:**
2.1. Mobilize to survey area with DEL-00.06 baseline report, survey forms, camera, measuring tools, safety equipment
2.2. Systematically traverse each road segment (same segments as DEL-00.06)
2.3. Rate overall pavement condition per rating system (same as DEL-00.06)
2.4. Document defects (same defect categories as DEL-00.06)
2.5. Take photographs at same locations as DEL-00.06 baseline for direct comparison
2.6. Record survey date, weather, personnel
2.7. Complete survey forms in field
2.8. Note any unusual conditions affecting comparison (recent maintenance, weather events, etc.)

### 3. Compare to baseline and identify construction-induced damage

**Action:** Analyze post-construction conditions against DEL-00.06 baseline to identify changes and attribute damage.

**Sub-steps:**
3.1. Compare post-construction survey data to DEL-00.06 baseline segment-by-segment
3.2. Identify changes (new defects, worsened defects, improved conditions)
3.3. Attribute changes using evidence:
  - If defect shown in DEL-00.06 baseline, attribute to pre-existing
  - If new defect in heavily trafficked construction area, attribute to construction-induced
  - If borderline attribution, note as "requires coordination with Employer"
3.4. Compile list of construction-induced damage items (deficiency list)
3.5. Compare photographs before/after to support attributions
3.6. Coordinate questionable attributions with Employer for agreement

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Survey Requirements section; Guidance.md Survey execution and comparison)

### 4. Prepare post-construction survey report

**Action:** Compile findings into survey report with baseline comparison.

**Sub-steps:**
4.1. Prepare report using project template (**TBD** — template not specified)
4.2. Write executive summary of post-construction conditions and construction impacts
4.3. Document survey area and methodology (reference DEL-00.06)
4.4. Present findings by segment with comparison to baseline
4.5. Document construction-induced damage analysis and deficiency list
4.6. Cross-reference photo log
4.7. Prepare appendices (comparison tables, deficiency list)
4.8. Review report for accuracy and fair attribution

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Guidance.md Survey execution and comparison)

### 5. Prepare photo log with before/after comparison

**Action:** Compile photographic documentation showing baseline and post-construction conditions.

**Sub-steps:**
5.1. Organize photos to match DEL-00.06 locations
5.2. Create before/after comparison presentation (side-by-side or sequential)
5.3. Annotate photos highlighting changes and construction-induced damage
5.4. Verify photos support deficiency list

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Guidance.md Survey execution and comparison)

### 6. Execute restoration

**Action:** Repair or otherwise resolve construction-induced damage items.

**Sub-steps:**
6.1. Prioritize deficiencies by severity and functional impact
6.2. Coordinate restoration approach with Employer (repair, compensation, acceptance as-is)
6.3. Execute restoration work per applicable standards (**TBD** — restoration standards not specified)
6.4. Document restoration work (work orders, material certifications, completion photos)
6.5. Obtain inspections and acceptance from Employer/authorities as required
6.6. Update deficiency list with resolution status

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Guidance.md Deficiency identification and restoration)

### 7. Prepare deficiency closeout documentation

**Action:** Compile deficiency closeout package demonstrating all items resolved.

**Sub-steps:**
7.1. Prepare deficiency closeout document listing all construction-induced items
7.2. Document resolution for each item (restoration work, acceptance, compensation)
7.3. Include supporting documentation (work orders, photos, inspection records)
7.4. Obtain Employer sign-off and acceptance
7.5. Obtain authority sign-off if required (**TBD** — authority requirements not specified)

(Cross-reference: Specification.md Reporting Requirements section; Guidance.md Deficiency identification and restoration)

### 8. Issue deliverable package

**Action:** Submit survey report, photo log, and deficiency closeout per project document control process.

**Sub-steps:**
8.1. Prepare transmittal package (**TBD** — transmittal format not specified)
8.2. Submit to project document control system (**TBD** — submittal process not defined)
8.3. Distribute to Employer, authorities (if required), and project stakeholders
8.4. Retain records for project closeout and warranty period

## Verification

**Completeness check:**
- Confirm post-construction survey report, photo log, and deficiency closeout have been produced. (Cross-reference: Datasheet.md Attributes section; Specification.md Deliverable Outputs section)

**Comparison validity check:**
- Verify survey methodology is consistent with DEL-00.06 baseline
- Verify comparison fairly identifies changes and attributes damage

**Closeout check:**
- Verify all identified construction-induced damage is restored or otherwise resolved
- Verify Employer/authority acceptance is obtained
