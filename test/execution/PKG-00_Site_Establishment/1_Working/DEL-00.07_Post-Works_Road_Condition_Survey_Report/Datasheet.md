## Conditions

**Project and scope context:**

- Project location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC. (Source: decomposition Section 1, line 10)
- Contract type: Design & Build. (Source: decomposition Section 1.1, line 44)
- Temporary works enabling scope distinct from permanent discipline works. (Source: decomposition Section 7, DEC-03, line 801)

**Deliverable intent:**

- Documents analysis and results for post-works road condition survey report required for design verification and approvals. (Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147)

**Survey context:**

- Survey shall document post-construction road conditions and compare to DEL-00.06 baseline to identify construction-induced damage.
- Survey supports terminal continuity (OBJ-5) by enabling appropriate restoration and closure of road condition obligations. (Source: decomposition Section 2, line 63; Section 6, line 784)
- Deficiency closeout demonstrates that construction-induced damage has been repaired or compensated.
- **TBD** — Survey timing, acceptance criteria, and deficiency resolution process not specified. (Source: `_REFERENCES.md`)

## Construction

**Anticipated report artifacts:**

- Post-construction road condition survey report
- Photo log
- Deficiency closeout

Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md`, Section 5, DEL-00.07, line 147.

**Report content scope (ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and anticipated artifacts):**

- **Post-construction road condition survey report:** Documented post-construction condition of access roads and haul routes (same survey area as DEL-00.06), comparison to baseline survey showing changes, identification of construction-induced damage, and recommendations for restoration
- **Photo log:** Comprehensive photographic record of post-construction road conditions using same locations/stations as DEL-00.06 baseline for direct comparison
- **Deficiency closeout:** Documentation of identified construction-induced damage, restoration actions taken, acceptance by Employer/authorities, and sign-off of road condition obligations

(ASSUMPTION: Typical post-construction road condition survey documentation. Specific survey methodology and closeout requirements to be confirmed from Employer's Requirements once available.)
