# Procedure: DEL-09.05 Marine Outfitting Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for producing and verifying **Marine Outfitting Installation & Test Records** within **PKG-09 Marine Outfitting**.

**Decomposition definition (authoritative):** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for marine outfitting. (**Source:** Decomposition, DEL-09.05 row)

**Deliverable type:** Record
**Responsible party:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

**Scope:** This procedure covers the records development process from records matrix definition through package compilation and submittal, including installation record collection, proof load testing (if required), completeness verification, and package preparation. This procedure is applied **during and after construction** (not during design development).

**Procedural note:** Unlike other PKG-09 deliverables (which are produced during design phase), DEL-09.05 records are produced during construction execution. The four framework documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure) define **how records will be produced and what they will contain**, but the actual records are generated during field installation and testing activities.

**Record management:**

| Record | Location | Retention | Purpose |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Draft records (in progress) | `1_Working/` | Per project procedures | Working files during construction |
| Review package | `2_Checking/To/` | Per project procedures | Submittal for review/acceptance |
| Issued records package | `3_Issued/` | **Permanent** retention (project record and regulatory compliance) | Final as-built record; handover documentation to Employer; operations/maintenance reference; regulatory compliance evidence; warranty reference |
| Records matrix | Deliverable folder or project QA system | Permanent | Tracking of record completeness and status; master index |
| Verification record | Deliverable folder or project QA system | Permanent | Evidence of completeness verification performed |
| NCR log and disposition evidence | Project QA/QC system | Permanent | NCR tracking, disposition documentation, closure verification; audit trail |
| Photographic records | Deliverable folder or project document management system | Permanent | Visual evidence of installation stages, as-built conditions, test execution; supports maintenance planning |
| Material certificates | Deliverable folder or project document management system | Permanent | Material compliance evidence; warranty support |
| Calibration certificates | Deliverable folder or project document management system | Permanent | Test equipment calibration verification; demonstrates test validity |
| Vendor installation instructions | Deliverable folder / `0_References/` | Permanent | Installation procedures used; reference for future maintenance/replacement |

**Record retention rationale:**
- **Permanent retention required for:** As-built project record, regulatory compliance evidence, handover documentation, operations/maintenance reference, warranty claims support, future modification/expansion reference.
- **Archive media:** Electronic storage in project document management system with backup/disaster recovery; consider paper archive for critical records per Employer requirements.
- **Access:** Provide access to Employer and facility operations/maintenance personnel after handover; maintain contractor access for warranty period.

**ASSUMPTION:** Electronic records managed in project document management system with appropriate access controls, backup/retention protocols (permanent retention with multiple backup locations), and audit trail capability.
