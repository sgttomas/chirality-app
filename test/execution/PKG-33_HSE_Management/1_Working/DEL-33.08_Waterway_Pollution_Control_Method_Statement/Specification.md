# Specification: DEL-33.08 Waterway Pollution Control Method Statement

## Scope

Defines the execution method and controls for waterway pollution control to meet safety, quality, and operational requirements during construction adjacent to Fraser River.

**Anticipated Artifacts:**
- Waterway protection method statement
- Spill prevention measures
- Monitoring approach

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 736

## Requirements

### FR-1: Spill Prevention Measures
Method statement shall define spill prevention controls:
- Secondary containment for fuel tanks, chemical storage, canola oil transfer areas
- Loading/unloading controls (drip trays, overfill protection, spill kits at transfer points)
- Equipment maintenance (inspect hoses, valves, pumps for leaks)
- Work area drainage controls (prevent contaminated runoff to waterway)

### FR-2: Spill Response Procedures
Method statement shall provide procedures for:
- **Minor spill (<100 L, on land, no waterway impact):** Isolate source, deploy absorbents, contain, cleanup, dispose waste, investigate
- **Major spill (>100 L or any spill reaching waterway):** Activate emergency response, deploy containment (booms), notify agencies (Coast Guard, provincial spill reporting), coordinate cleanup
- **Marine spill:** Deploy marine spill booms, coordinate with Coast Guard, marine spill response contractor, wildlife protection

### FR-3: Marine Work Controls
Method statement shall define controls for in-water and over-water work:
- Silt curtains or turbidity barriers for pile driving, dredging, in-water construction
- Work windows (avoid fish spawning periods if restricted by Fisheries Act authorization)
- Vessel operations protocol (fuel transfer, bilge discharge prohibition, waste management)
- Marine debris management (prevent construction debris from entering water)

### FR-4: Spill Response Equipment
Method statement shall specify equipment and materials:
- **Land spill kits:** Absorbent pads, socks, granular absorbent, drain covers, disposal bags
- **Marine spill kits:** Absorbent booms, skimmers, temporary storage, containment equipment
- Location: spill kits positioned at high-risk areas (fuel storage, canola oil transfer, marine loading, tank farm)
- Inspection: monthly inspection, restock after use

**Source:** Datasheet Waterway Protection Measures; DEL-33.07 Specification FR-3

### FR-5: Training
Method statement shall specify training for:
- Spill prevention awareness (all site personnel — site induction)
- Spill response (spill response team — spill kit deployment, containment, notification)
- Marine spill response (marine operations personnel — marine boom deployment, Coast Guard coordination)

**Source:** DEL-33.01 Specification FR-7; Datasheet Method Statement Structure

### FR-6: Monitoring
Method statement shall define monitoring approach:
- Daily visual monitoring (watch for sheens, discoloration, debris in waterway)
- Incident-driven monitoring (water quality sampling after spill or near-miss)
- Permit-required monitoring (if environmental permits require waterway monitoring)

**Source:** Datasheet Waterway Protection Measures; DEL-33.04 CEMP monitoring

### FR-7: Regulatory Notification
Method statement shall define notification requirements for waterway pollution:
- **Immediate notification:** Coast Guard (1-800-889-8852), provincial spill reporting (1-800-663-3456), Employer
- **Follow-up notification:** Federal/provincial environmental agencies (written spill report within 24-48 hours)
- **Threshold:** Any spill or unauthorized discharge to waterway (regardless of quantity)
