# Guidance: DEL-33.08 Waterway Pollution Control Method Statement

## Purpose

Waterway Pollution Control Method Statement provides procedures to prevent pollution of Fraser River during construction and respond effectively if spills occur.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`; Decomposition Section 1 (location — Fraser River)

## Principles

### Principle 1: Prevention First
Preventing pollution is far more effective than cleanup. Spill prevention controls (secondary containment, loading procedures, maintenance) are the primary focus.

**Source:** OBJ-7 Environmental Protection; ASSUMPTION: Pollution prevention principle

### Principle 2: Rapid Response Minimizes Impact
Time is critical in spill response. Pre-positioned equipment, trained responders, and clear procedures enable rapid containment before spill reaches waterway.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Spill response principle

### Principle 3: Fisheries Act Compliance
Federal Fisheries Act prohibits any deleterious substance from entering fish-bearing waters. Fraser River is fish-bearing. Even minor spills or turbidity can violate Fisheries Act.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Federal Fisheries Act; Location: Fraser River (fish-bearing waterway)

## Considerations

### Fraser River Sensitivity

**Environmental Context:**
- Fraser River is major fish-bearing waterway (salmon, sturgeon)
- Tidal influence (twice daily tidal cycle affects spill behavior)
- River current (seasonal variation — high flow during freshet)
- Regulatory sensitivity (federal and provincial oversight)

**Implications for Method Statement:**
- Spill response must account for tidal movement (contain before high tide)
- Marine spill booms must be anchored to withstand current
- Work windows may be restricted during fish spawning periods
- Any spill to waterway requires immediate regulatory notification

### Marine Construction Interface

Marine works (PKG-08, PKG-09, PKG-11) create waterway pollution risks:
- **Pile Driving:** Turbidity (sediment suspension) from impact pile driving — requires silt curtains
- **In-Water Construction:** Debris, concrete, grout entering water — requires containment and cleanup
- **Barge Operations:** Fuel spills from vessel refueling, bilge discharge — requires vessel protocol
- **Equipment Over Water:** Hydraulic oil leaks from crane/equipment working over water — requires secondary containment or absorbent mats

**Guidance:** Method statement should require pre-work planning for all marine operations (identify spill risks, position spill kits, deploy containment before work starts).

### Canola Oil Spill Characteristics

CSD canola oil is a combustible liquid with specific spill behavior:
- **Lighter than water:** Floats on surface, spreads rapidly
- **Viscosity:** Low viscosity (flows easily, difficult to contain)
- **Environmental impact:** Coats shoreline, affects waterfowl, suffocates fish/aquatic organisms
- **Cleanup:** Absorbent booms, skimmers, manual recovery; contaminated absorbents = hazardous waste

**Guidance:** Large-volume canola oil spill (tank overfill, pipeline rupture) is catastrophic environmental scenario. Prevention through overfill protection, leak detection, secondary containment is critical.

## Examples

### Example 1: Spill Response Procedure for Marine Canola Oil Spill

**Scenario:** Pipeline rupture during vessel loading — canola oil spills to Fraser River

**Immediate Response (0-15 minutes):**
1. **Stop Source:** Emergency shutdown of loading pumps, close valves
2. **Activate Emergency Response:** Alert Emergency Coordinator, activate spill response team
3. **Deploy Containment:** Deploy marine absorbent booms around spill (from shore and from vessel/barge if safe)
4. **Notify:** Call Coast Guard (1-800-889-8852), provincial spill reporting (1-800-663-3456), Employer (DP World), report: location, product (canola oil), estimated quantity, containment actions

**Short-Term Response (15 minutes - 2 hours):**
1. **Contain Spill:** Deploy additional booms, anchor booms to withstand current/tide
2. **Recover Product:** Use skimmers and vacuum trucks to recover floating oil
3. **Protect Sensitive Areas:** Prioritize boom deployment to protect shoreline, sensitive habitat (if identified), intake structures
4. **Monitor:** Track spill movement (current, tide, wind), adjust containment as needed
5. **Safety:** Ensure spill response personnel have appropriate PPE (flotation, chemical-resistant), prevent secondary injuries

**Cleanup (2 hours - days):**
1. **Product Recovery:** Continue skimming and vacuum recovery until no visible sheen
2. **Shoreline Cleanup:** Manual cleanup of oiled shoreline using absorbent pads, dispose as hazardous waste (DEL-33.06)
3. **Waste Disposal:** Dispose of recovered oil and contaminated absorbents per hazardous waste manifests (DEL-33.06)
4. **Wildlife Impact:** Coordinate with wildlife agency if oiled wildlife observed
5. **Regulatory Coordination:** Provide regular updates to Coast Guard and provincial agencies, final spill report within 30 days

**Investigation:**
- Incident investigation per DEL-33.01 (root cause, CAPA)
- Regulatory investigation coordination (WorkSafeBC, environmental agencies)
