| Primary Hazard | Spill of canola oil, fuel, or chemicals to Fraser River | Product: CSD canola oil; DEL-33.01 Guidance Hazardous Substances |

### Waterway Protection Measures

| Measure | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Spill Prevention | Secondary containment, loading/unloading controls, equipment maintenance | OBJ-7 Environmental Protection; ASSUMPTION: Spill prevention best practice |
| Spill Response Equipment | Marine spill kits, absorbent booms, skimmers, containment equipment | DEL-33.07 Specification FR-3 (emergency equipment); ASSUMPTION: Marine spill response |
| Work Area Isolation | Silt curtains, turbidity barriers for in-water work | PKG-08 Marine Structures; ASSUMPTION: In-water work controls |
| Drainage Controls | Prevent contaminated runoff from reaching waterway | DEL-33.04 CEMP, DEL-33.05 SPPP (drainage interface) |

| Monitoring | Visual monitoring (daily), water quality monitoring (if required by permits) | DEL-33.04 CEMP monitoring; TBD: Permit monitoring requirements |

### Spill Response Procedures

| Spill Type | Response Actions | Source |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Minor Spill (<100 L on land) | Isolate source, deploy absorbents, contain spill, cleanup, dispose waste, investigate | ASSUMPTION: Minor spill threshold and response |
| Major Spill (>100 L or any spill to waterway) | Activate emergency response, deploy containment (booms, skimmers), notify regulatory agencies, coordinate cleanup, investigate | DEL-33.07 Emergency Response Plan; ASSUMPTION: Major spill threshold |
| Marine Spill (canola oil or fuel to Fraser River) | Deploy marine spill booms, coordinate with Coast Guard, implement marine spill response plan, wildlife protection | Location: Fraser River; OBJ-7 Environmental Protection |

## Conditions

**Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, adjacent to Fraser River
**Environmental Sensitivity:** Fraser River is fish-bearing waterway (federal Fisheries Act protection)
**Marine Operations:** PKG-08 (Marine Structures), PKG-09 (Marine Outfitting), PKG-11 (Marine Loading System) involve in-water and over-water work
**Regulatory Scrutiny:** Federal and provincial environmental agencies oversight
