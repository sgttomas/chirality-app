# Procedure: DEL-33.08 Waterway Pollution Control Method Statement

## Purpose

Defines how to develop and implement waterway pollution control procedures during construction adjacent to Fraser River.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 736

## Prerequisites

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- DEL-33.01 (OHS Plan Section 10, FR-10 — environmental interface)
- DEL-33.04 (CEMP) — spill prevention/response interface
- DEL-33.05 (SPPP) — drainage controls
- DEL-33.07 (Emergency Response Plan) — spill emergency procedures
- Environmental permits (waterway work approvals) — **TBD** (PKG-32)

**Source:** Specification; DEL-33.01

## Steps

### Step 1: Develop Waterway Protection Method Statement

**Actions:**
1. Identify waterway pollution risks (from DEL-33.02 risk assessments — spill scenarios, in-water work turbidity, vessel operations)
2. Define spill prevention measures (secondary containment, loading controls, maintenance, drainage)
3. Develop spill response procedures (minor, major, marine spills)
4. Define marine work controls (silt curtains, work windows, vessel protocol)
5. Specify spill response equipment (land spill kits, marine spill kits, deployment locations)
6. Define training requirements (spill response, marine operations)
7. Define monitoring approach (daily visual, incident-driven sampling)
8. Define regulatory notification protocols (Coast Guard, provincial spill reporting, Employer)

**Output:** Draft method statement

**Source:** Specification FR-1 through FR-7; Datasheet Method Statement Structure

### Step 2: Review, Approve, and Issue

**Actions:**
1. Review with Environmental Coordinator, HSE Manager, marine operations lead
2. Coordinate with Employer (DP World) for Terminal interface (shared spill response resources)
3. Coordinate with Coast Guard and provincial agencies (if required by permits)
4. Approve (HSE Manager or Project Manager)
5. Issue controlled copies (site, Employer, regulatory agencies if required)

**Output:** Approved method statement

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Method statement approval process

### Step 3: Implement Waterway Protection

**Actions:**
1. **Spill Prevention:** Install secondary containment (fuel tanks, chemical storage, canola oil transfer areas). Implement loading/unloading protocols.
2. **Spill Equipment:** Position spill kits (land and marine) at high-risk areas. Inspect monthly, restock after use.
3. **Marine Work:** Deploy silt curtains before in-water work (pile driving, dredging). Monitor turbidity during work.
4. **Training:** Train spill response team (spill kit deployment, boom deployment, notification). Include spill scenarios in emergency drills (DEL-33.07).
5. **Monitoring:** Conduct daily visual monitoring (walk waterway perimeter, watch for sheens/discoloration/debris).

**Output:** Waterway protection measures operational

**Source:** Specification FR-1, FR-3, FR-4, FR-5, FR-6; DEL-33.07 Procedure Step 3 (implement emergency preparedness)

### Step 4: Respond to Spills (When They Occur)

**Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Stop source, deploy containment, activate spill response team
2. **Notify:** Per regulatory notification requirements (FR-7)
3. **Contain:** Deploy absorbents (land), booms (marine)
4. **Recover:** Cleanup and recover product/contaminated materials
5. **Dispose:** Dispose of waste per DEL-33.06 (hazardous waste manifests)
6. **Investigate:** Incident investigation per DEL-33.01 (root cause, CAPA)
7. **Report:** Regulatory spill report (written, within 24-48 hours)

**Output:** Spill contained and cleaned up; investigation and report complete

**Source:** Specification FR-2, FR-7; Datasheet Spill Response Procedures; DEL-33.07 Emergency Response

## Verification

- Spill prevention controls in place (secondary containment, loading protocols)
- Spill equipment positioned and inspected
- Marine work controls implemented (silt curtains for in-water work)
- Personnel trained (spill response)
- Monitoring program active (daily visual)
- No spills to waterway (or if spills occur, properly managed and reported)

**Source:** Specification Verification

## Records

- Spill kit inspection records
- Silt curtain inspection and turbidity monitoring (marine work)
- Spill incident reports (if spills occur)
- Regulatory spill reports (if reportable)
- Spill response drill reports

**Location:** Environmental database / `3_Issued/`; cross-reference DEL-33.04 (CEMP records), DEL-33.07 (emergency drill records)
