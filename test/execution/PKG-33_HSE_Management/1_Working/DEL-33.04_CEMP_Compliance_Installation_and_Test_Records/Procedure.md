# Procedure: DEL-33.04 CEMP Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This procedure defines how to **collect**, **manage**, and **report** CEMP Compliance Records during construction.

**Deliverable Type:** Record
**Responsible Party:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)
**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 732

## Prerequisites

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- DEL-33.01 (OHS Plan) — environmental integration requirements (Section 10, FR-10, Procedure Step 4.8)
- CEMP — project Construction Environmental Management Plan (**TBD: separate deliverable or embedded in DEL-33.01?**)
- PKG-32 — Environmental permits with monitoring conditions
- Environmental Coordinator appointed (per DEL-33.01 organizational structure)

**Reference Materials:**
- CEMP (project plan)
- Environmental permits (monitoring parameters, frequencies, limits)
- Contractor's environmental procedures
- Regulatory reporting forms

**Source:** Specification Prerequisites; DEL-33.01 Guidance Organizational Considerations (Environmental Coordinator)

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Environmental Monitoring Program

**Actions:**
1. Review CEMP, permits, and ER for required monitoring and inspections
2. Develop monitoring schedule (daily, weekly, monthly inspections; sampling events)
3. Identify monitoring personnel (Environmental Coordinator, QA/QC inspectors, qualified samplers)
4. Procure monitoring equipment (dust meters, noise meters, water sampling kits)
5. Engage qualified environmental laboratory (for water/soil sampling analysis)
6. Prepare record templates (inspection checklists, monitoring logs, data sheets)

**Output:** Environmental monitoring program established

**Source:** Datasheet Inspection & Monitoring Frequency; Specification FR-1 through FR-5

### Step 2: Conduct Routine Monitoring and Inspections

**Actions:**

**Daily/Weekly Inspections:**
- ESC inspections (daily during rain, weekly during dry periods)
- Dust control visual inspections (daily)
- Spill kit inspections (monthly)
- Document on inspection forms (date, inspector, findings, corrective actions)

**Event-Driven Monitoring:**
- Water quality sampling (per permit schedule or after significant rain events)
- Spill response and cleanup verification (when spills occur)

**Corrective Actions:**
- Identify deficiencies during inspections
- Implement corrective actions immediately (repair ESC, enhance dust control)
- Verify effectiveness
- Document corrective actions and closure

**Output:** Inspection records, monitoring data, corrective action logs

**Source:** Specification FR-1 through FR-4; Datasheet Record Types; Guidance Examples

### Step 3: Compile and Report

**Actions:**
1. Compile records per ER and permit schedules (monthly, quarterly, annually)
2. Prepare compliance reports:
   - Summary of monitoring activities
   - Results and comparison to permit limits
   - Exceedances and corrective actions
   - Non-compliances and resolutions
3. Submit to Employer and regulatory agencies (as required by permits)
4. Archive records in project document management system

**Output:** CEMP compliance reports, archived records

**Source:** Specification PR-3 (Timely Reporting); Specification Documentation

### Step 4: Audit and Continuous Improvement

**Actions:**
1. Conduct CEMP compliance audits (quarterly or per ER)
2. Identify non-compliances and opportunities for improvement
3. Implement corrective actions
4. Update CEMP or procedures if systemic issues identified

**Output:** CEMP audit reports, updated procedures

**Source:** Datasheet CEMP Elements (CEMP Audit); Specification FR-5

## Verification

- Record completeness (all required monitoring/inspections conducted and documented)
- Data accuracy (sampling methodology, laboratory QA/QC)
- Permit compliance (monitoring meets permit schedules and parameters)
- Corrective action closure (deficiencies resolved)

**Source:** Specification Verification

## Records

**Records:**
- ESC inspection records
- Dust control records
- Environmental monitoring data (water quality, air quality, noise)
- Spill incident reports and cleanup records
- CEMP audit reports
- Regulatory inspection records
- Compliance reports (monthly/quarterly/annual)

**Location:** Environmental database / `3_Issued/`

**Retention:** Project duration + regulatory retention period (TBD)
