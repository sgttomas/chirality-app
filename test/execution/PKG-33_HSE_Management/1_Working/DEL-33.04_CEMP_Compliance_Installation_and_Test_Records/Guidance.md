# Guidance: DEL-33.04 CEMP Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

CEMP (Construction Environmental Management Plan) Compliance Records provide evidence that construction environmental controls are implemented, inspected, and effective.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`; DEL-33.01 Specification FR-10

## Principles

### Principle 1: Records as Compliance Evidence
Environmental records serve as proof of regulatory and permit compliance. Missing or incomplete records = presumption of non-compliance.

**Source:** OBJ-6 Regulatory Compliance; ASSUMPTION: Environmental compliance documentation requirement

### Principle 2: Real-Time Documentation
Environmental inspections and monitoring should be documented in real-time (not reconstructed later). This ensures accuracy and credibility.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Environmental record best practice

## Considerations

### CEMP Scope

CEMP typically covers:
- **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Prevent sediment from leaving site or entering waterways (critical for Fraser River location)
- **Dust Control:** Minimize dust generation and off-site migration (critical for active Terminal operations)
- **Spill Prevention:** Secondary containment, spill kits, response procedures
- **Waste Management:** Proper handling and disposal of construction waste (interface with DEL-33.06)
- **Water Management:** Dewatering, stormwater management (interface with DEL-33.05 SPPP)
- **Vegetation/Wildlife Protection:** Protect existing vegetation, manage wildlife conflicts
- **Noise/Vibration Control:** Minimize impacts to neighbors and Terminal operations (interface with OBJ-5)

### Fraser River Interface

Project location adjacent to Fraser River creates specific environmental considerations:
- Sediment control is critical (no sediment discharge to river)
- Spill response must prevent waterway contamination
- Marine construction (PKG-08, PKG-09, PKG-11) requires waterway pollution control (DEL-33.08)
- Regulatory scrutiny (federal Fisheries Act, provincial Environmental Management Act)

### Terminal Operations Interface

Active terminal operations create environmental coordination requirements:
- Dust control during vessel loading (minimize product contamination)
- Noise restrictions during sensitive operations
- Shared drainage and spill response infrastructure
- Environmental complaint management (Terminal tenants, neighbors)

## Examples

### Example 1: ESC Inspection Record

**Date:** 2026-03-15 | **Weather:** Rain (15mm overnight) | **Inspector:** Jane Doe, Environmental Coordinator

| ESC Measure | Location | Condition | Deficiencies | Corrective Action | Status |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Silt Fence | East perimeter | Good | None | N/A | OK |
| Straw Wattles | Tank farm slope | Fair | 2 wattles displaced by runoff | Reposition wattles, add stakes | Completed 2026-03-15 |
| Sediment Trap | Site entrance | Poor | 80% full, sediment overtopping | Excavate trap, dispose of sediment, restore capacity | Completed 2026-03-16 |
| Stabilized Entrance | Main gate | Good | Gravel tracking onto public road | Additional sweeping, replenish gravel | Completed 2026-03-15 |

**Overall Assessment:** ESC measures effective; sediment contained on-site; no discharge to Fraser River observed.

**Next Inspection:** 2026-03-22 (or next rain event >10mm, whichever is sooner)
