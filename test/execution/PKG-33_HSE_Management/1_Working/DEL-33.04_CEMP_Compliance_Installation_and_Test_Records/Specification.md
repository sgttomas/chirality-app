## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Records
Records shall document:
- ESC measures installed (silt fencing, straw wattles, sediment traps, stabilized entrances)
- Routine inspections (daily during rain, weekly during dry periods)
- Maintenance activities (repairs, replacements, enhancements)
- Effectiveness assessments (sediment containment, no off-site discharge)
- Deficiencies and corrective actions

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard CEMP ESC component; OBJ-7 Environmental Protection; Datasheet CEMP Elements

#### FR-2: Dust Control Records
Records shall document:
- Dust suppression activities (water spraying, road sweeping, covering stockpiles)
- Weather conditions (wind speed, precipitation)
- Visual effectiveness (no visible dust leaving site)
- Complaints and corrective actions

**Source:** Datasheet CEMP Elements; OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity (minimize disturbance)

#### FR-3: Environmental Monitoring Data
Records shall document required monitoring per environmental permits:
- Sampling date, time, location, weather
- Parameters measured (water quality, air quality, noise, vibration)
- Results and comparison to permit limits
- Exceedances, investigations, corrective actions
- Laboratory analysis reports (chain of custody)

**Source:** Datasheet CEMP Elements; Cross-reference PKG-32 (permit conditions); TBD: Specific permit monitoring requirements

#### FR-4: Spill Prevention and Response Records
Records shall document:
- Spill kit inspections (monthly or after use)
- Spill incidents (date, location, material, quantity, cause, response, cleanup verification)
- Regulatory reporting (if reportable spill)
- Lessons learned and preventive actions

**Source:** Datasheet CEMP Elements; DEL-33.08 Waterway Pollution Control; DEL-33.01 Incident Management

#### FR-5: CEMP Audit and Compliance Records
Records shall document:
- CEMP compliance audits (quarterly or per ER)
- Audit findings and non-compliances
- Corrective action plans and completion
- Regulatory inspections (environmental agencies)
- Employer inspections (DP World environmental compliance)

**Source:** Datasheet CEMP Elements; TBD: ER CEMP audit requirements; OBJ-6 Regulatory Compliance

### Performance Requirements

#### PR-1: Record Completeness
All required CEMP monitoring and inspection records per permits and ER shall be maintained.

**Source:** OBJ-6 Regulatory Compliance

#### PR-2: Record Accuracy
Environmental monitoring data shall be accurate, verifiable, and traceable to qualified laboratories (where applicable).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Data quality requirements for regulatory compliance

#### PR-3: Timely Reporting
Records shall be compiled and submitted per ER and permit schedules (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).

**Source:** TBD: ER and permit reporting schedules

### Interface Requirements

#### IR-1: OHS Plan Interface
CEMP records implement environmental integration requirements of DEL-33.01 (OHS Plan Section 10, FR-10).

**Source:** DEL-33.01 Specification FR-10; DEL-33.01 Procedure Step 4.8

#### IR-2: SPPP Interface
CEMP records interface with stormwater monitoring (DEL-33.05) for integrated water quality management.

#### IR-3: Waterway Pollution Control Interface
Spill records interface with waterway pollution control procedures (DEL-33.08).

**Source:** Cross-reference DEL-33.08; Datasheet CEMP Elements (spill response)

#### IR-4: Regulatory & Permits Interface
CEMP records demonstrate compliance with permit conditions (PKG-32).
