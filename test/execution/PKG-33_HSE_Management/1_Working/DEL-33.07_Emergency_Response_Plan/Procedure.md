# Procedure: DEL-33.07 Emergency Response Plan

## Purpose

Defines how to develop and implement the Site Emergency Response Plan during construction.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 735

## Prerequisites

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- DEL-33.01 (OHS Plan) — emergency preparedness requirements (Section 6, FR-6, Procedure Step 4.5)
- DEL-33.02 (Risk Assessments) — emergency scenarios based on credible risks
- Site layout and access (DEL-00.01) — muster points, evacuation routes, emergency access

**Source:** DEL-33.01; Specification

## Steps

### Step 1: Develop Emergency Response Plan

**Actions:**
1. Identify emergency scenarios (from risk assessments DEL-33.02, project hazards DEL-33.01)
2. Define emergency response organization (roles, 24/7 contacts)
3. Develop scenario-specific response procedures (medical, fire, spill, rescue, evacuation)
4. Identify emergency equipment and facilities (first aid, fire, spill, rescue)
5. Define communication protocols (internal alarms/radio, external 911/Employer/regulatory)
6. Prepare site emergency maps (muster points, evacuation routes, emergency equipment locations)
7. Coordinate with DP World Terminal emergency organization (interface protocols)
8. Coordinate with external emergency services (fire department site familiarization, ambulance access)

**Output:** Draft Emergency Response Plan

**Source:** Specification FR-1 through FR-8; Datasheet Plan Structure

### Step 2: Review, Approve, and Issue

**Actions:**
1. Review with emergency response team
2. Review with Employer (DP World) for Terminal interface
3. Coordinate with external emergency services (fire department walkthrough)
4. Approve (Project Manager or designate)
5. Issue controlled copies (site offices, first aid stations, gate, Employer, emergency services)

**Output:** Approved Emergency Response Plan

### Step 3: Implement Emergency Preparedness

**Actions:**
1. **Emergency Equipment:** Procure and install first aid kits, fire extinguishers, spill kits, rescue equipment. Inspect monthly (DEL-33.01 Procedure Step 4.5).
2. **Training:** Train emergency response personnel (First Aid Attendants, Fire Wardens, Spill Response Team, Rescue Team). Cross-reference PKG-35.
3. **Communication:** Establish emergency communication system (alarm, radios, phones). Post emergency contact list at visible locations.
4. **Signage:** Install muster point signs, evacuation route signs, emergency equipment location signs.
5. **Drills:** Conduct emergency drills per schedule (evacuation quarterly, fire quarterly, spill semi-annually, confined space rescue quarterly). Debrief and improve plan based on drill findings.

**Output:** Emergency response capability operational

**Source:** DEL-33.01 Procedure Step 4.5; Specification FR-3, FR-7

### Step 4: Respond to Emergencies (When They Occur)

**Actions:**
1. Recognize emergency and activate response
2. Follow scenario-specific response procedure
3. Notify per communication protocols
4. Implement emergency actions (first aid, evacuation, spill containment, rescue)
5. Stand down when emergency resolved (Emergency Coordinator authorization)
6. Investigate incident (DEL-33.01 Procedure Step 4.6)
7. Implement CAPA and update Emergency Response Plan if needed

**Output:** Emergency managed; incident investigation; plan updated if required
