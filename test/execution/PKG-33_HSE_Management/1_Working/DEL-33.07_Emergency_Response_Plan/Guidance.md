# Guidance: DEL-33.07 Emergency Response Plan

## Purpose

Emergency Response Plan establishes the framework for responding to emergencies during construction to protect life, property, and environment.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`; DEL-33.01 Specification FR-6

## Principles

### Principle 1: Life Safety First
Emergency response prioritizes life safety over property or environmental protection. However, spill response must balance life safety with preventing waterway contamination.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Emergency response priority hierarchy

### Principle 2: Pre-Planning Reduces Response Time
Emergencies require immediate action. Pre-planned procedures, trained responders, and positioned equipment enable faster, more effective response.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Emergency preparedness principle

### Principle 3: Coordination with External Services
Most serious emergencies (fire, serious injury, major spill) require external emergency services (fire department, ambulance, Coast Guard). Plan must facilitate their rapid access and effective response.

## Considerations

### Terminal Interface Emergency Coordination

**Shared Emergency Services:**
- DP World Terminal may have on-site fire brigade, medical responders
- Contractor emergency plan must interface with Terminal's plan
- Joint drills required (test communication, command, mutual aid)

**Emergency Access:**
- Ensure fire department can access all areas (gates unlocked or key box, access roads clear)
- Provide site map and emergency contact list to Terminal and emergency services

### Fraser River Marine Emergency Interface

**Marine Emergencies:**
- Person overboard during barge operations (PKG-08, PKG-09)
- Vessel collision with marine structures
- Marine spill (fuel, canola oil)

**Coordination:**
- Coast Guard notification for marine emergencies
- Marine rescue equipment (throw bags, life rings, rescue boat)
- Marine VHF radio communication

### Project-Specific Emergency Scenarios

**Confined Space Rescue:**
- Non-entry rescue preferred (retrieval using winch/tripod)
- Entry rescue only if safe and rescue team trained/equipped
- Rescue plan required before confined space entry
- Drill quarterly (or before first entry)

**Source:** DEL-33.01 Guidance Confined Space; DEL-33.02 Example 2 (confined space JHA — rescue plan)

**Canola Oil Spill:**
- Large-volume spill potential (tank overfill, pipeline rupture, loading arm failure)
- Containment (dikes, drainage isolation, absorbents)
- Waterway protection (prevent discharge to Fraser River)
- Cleanup and disposal (used absorbents as hazardous waste)
- Regulatory notification (provincial environmental agency for reportable spill)

## Examples

### Example: Medical Emergency Response Procedure

**Emergency:** Worker injury requiring medical treatment

**Response Procedure:**
1. **Immediate:** Secure scene (stop work, isolate hazard). Do not move injured person unless immediate danger (fire, structural collapse).
2. **Call First Aid:** Radio "Code Red" on emergency channel. State location and nature of injury.
3. **First Aid Response:** First Aid Attendant responds with first aid kit, assesses injury, provides treatment.
4. **Ambulance:** If serious injury (unconscious, major bleeding, suspected fracture/spinal injury, chest pain), call 911 immediately. Provide address: 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC; specific location on site; nature of injury.
5. **Notify:** First Aid Attendant notifies HSE Manager and Project Manager. HSE Manager notifies Employer and WorkSafeBC (if serious injury).
6. **Investigation:** HSE Manager initiates incident investigation (DEL-33.01 Procedure Step 4.6).
7. **Stand-Down:** Emergency Coordinator authorizes return to work after scene secured and investigation commenced.

**Emergency Contacts:**
- Site First Aid Attendants: [Names, mobile numbers] — **TBD**
- Emergency Coordinator (HSE Manager): [Name, mobile] — **TBD**
- 911: Ambulance (provide address, location, injury details)
- WorkSafeBC: 1-888-621-7233 (serious injury/fatality — immediate notification)
