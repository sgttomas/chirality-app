## Principles

### Foundational HSE Principles

#### Principle 1: Zero Harm

The OHS Plan must be grounded in the principle that all injuries and occupational illnesses are preventable. This requires:
- Proactive hazard identification before work begins
- Elimination or substitution of hazards where practicable
- Engineered controls as the primary risk reduction method
- Administrative controls and PPE as supplementary measures
- Continuous improvement and learning from incidents and near-misses

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Industry best practice; OBJ-1 Safe & Reliable Operation (Decomposition Section 2); Specification PR-2 (Zero Harm Objective), FR-8 (Incident Management — lessons learned)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.3 (Section 1 — zero harm objective), Procedure Step 4.6 (Incident Management — lessons learned)

#### Principle 2: Legal Compliance as Minimum Standard

WorkSafeBC requirements and applicable codes represent the minimum acceptable standard. The Contractor's OHS Plan should:
- Fully comply with all regulatory requirements
- Exceed regulatory minimums where industry best practice or project-specific risks warrant
- Anticipate regulatory changes and inspector expectations
- Maintain documented evidence of compliance

**Source:** OBJ-6 Regulatory Compliance (Decomposition Section 2); ASSUMPTION: WorkSafeBC regulatory framework for BC; Specification FR-3 (Legal Compliance), PR-3 (Regulatory Compliance)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.3 (Section 3 — regulatory compliance matrix), Procedure Step 4.7 (audit and compliance verification)

#### Principle 3: Risk-Based Resource Allocation

HSE resources (personnel, equipment, budget) should be allocated proportionate to risk:
- High-risk activities (marine operations, heavy lifting, confined space) receive intensive planning, supervision, and monitoring
- Routine low-risk activities receive standardized controls and periodic verification
- Risk assessment (DEL-33.02) drives resource allocation decisions

**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.2 (Hazard Identification and Risk Profiling), Procedure Step 4.3 (Risk Assessment)

#### Principle 4: Integration with Operations

HSE is not a parallel activity — it must be integrated into all aspects of project planning and execution:
- HSE considered in design reviews and constructability assessments
- HSE milestones integrated into construction schedule
- HSE performance metrics integrated into project reporting
- HSE competency integrated into personnel qualification requirements

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Integrated HSE management principle; Specification QR-1 (Document Quality — integration with QMP)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 4.1 through 4.8 (all implementation steps integrate HSE with operations)

#### Principle 5: Accountability at All Levels

Everyone on the project has HSE responsibilities:
- Senior management: visible leadership, resource allocation, policy setting
- Line supervision: implementation, enforcement, coaching
- Workers: participation, compliance, stop-work authority
- HSE specialists: expertise, audit, continuous improvement

The OHS Plan must clearly define these accountabilities.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard HSE accountability framework; Specification FR-2 (Organization and Responsibilities — authority levels)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.3 (Section 2 — roles and responsibilities matrix)

### Design & Build Context Considerations

#### D&B HSE Challenges

Design & Build contracts present unique HSE challenges that the OHS Plan must address:

1. **Concurrent Design and Construction** — Design evolves while construction is underway, creating:
   - Changing hazard profiles as design is finalized
   - Potential for rework and unplanned activities
   - Need for agile risk assessment processes

2. **Supply Chain Complexity** — Multiple subcontractors and suppliers require:
   - Robust subcontractor HSE prequalification and management
   - Clear interface definitions for shared work areas
   - Coordination of emergency response across multiple parties

3. **Fast-Track Schedule** — Accelerated delivery creates pressure to:
   - Maintain HSE discipline despite schedule pressure
   - Plan HSE controls ahead of need (long-lead items)
   - Balance speed with thoroughness in HSE processes

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard D&B project characteristics; Contract type: Design & Build (Decomposition Section 1); Specification QR-2 (Plan Maintenance — changes in scope)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Section 3 (Managing OHS Plan Revisions — scope changes)

#### Active Terminal Interface

The project is located within an active Fraser Surrey Terminal, creating specific HSE considerations:

- **Operational Continuity:** Construction activities must not compromise Terminal safety or disrupt commercial operations (OBJ-5)
- **Shared Emergency Response:** Coordination with Terminal emergency response organization (fire, spill, medical)
- **Traffic Management:** Construction traffic must integrate with Terminal logistics without creating safety conflicts
- **Work Permit Coordination:** Contractor's permit-to-work system must interface with Terminal's permit system

## Considerations

### Regulatory Environment

#### WorkSafeBC Compliance

British Columbia's occupational health and safety regulatory framework is administered by WorkSafeBC:

**Key Considerations:**
- **OH&S Regulation:** Comprehensive regulation covering all aspects of workplace safety (29 parts)
- **Part 3:** Rights and responsibilities (worker/employer duties, stop work, refusal of unsafe work)
- **Part 4:** General conditions (first aid, sanitation, working alone)
- **Part 8:** Personal protective equipment
- **Part 9:** Confined spaces
- **Part 11:** Fall protection
- **Part 14:** Cranes and hoists
- **Part 20:** Construction, excavation, and demolition
- **Inspections:** Unannounded WorkSafeBC inspections, orders, penalties
- **Incident Reporting:** Immediate notification for serious injuries/fatalities, written reports

**Guidance:** The OHS Plan should include a regulatory compliance matrix mapping each applicable OH&S Regulation Part to project controls. Designate a regulatory compliance coordinator.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: WorkSafeBC regulatory framework for Surrey, BC; OBJ-6 Regulatory Compliance; Specification FR-3 (Legal Compliance), Standards (Regulatory Standards)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.3 (Section 3 — regulatory compliance matrix)

#### Permits and Approvals

The OHS Plan must interface with regulatory permits:

- **Construction Permits:** Municipal building permits (HSE-related conditions)
- **Environmental Permits:** Provincial/federal environmental approvals (spill prevention, monitoring)
- **Marine Permits:** Canadian Coast Guard approvals, port authority work permits
- **Utility Permits:** Crossing agreements (railway, utilities)

**Guidance:** Cross-reference PKG-32 (Regulatory & Permits) to ensure all permit-related HSE obligations are incorporated into the OHS Plan.

**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.3 (Section 3 — permit register), Procedure Step 4.3 (verify permit prerequisites)

### Organizational Considerations

#### HSE Organizational Structure

The OHS Plan should define an organizational structure appropriate for a multi-discipline, multi-package D&B project:

**Typical Structure (ASSUMPTION):**
- **Project HSE Manager:** Senior HSE professional, reports to Project Manager, overall accountability
- **HSE Coordinators:** Discipline-specific (civil, marine, mechanical, electrical), embedded with construction teams
- **HSE Officers/Inspectors:** Daily inspections, permit verification, incident investigation support
- **Environmental Coordinator:** Interface with CEMP, SPPP, waste management (PKG-33 environmental deliverables)
- **First Aid Attendants:** WorkSafeBC-certified first aid coverage per Part 3
- **Subcontractor HSE Leads:** Each major subcontractor designates HSE representative

**Guidance:** Organizational chart should show reporting lines, interfaces with Employer and regulatory authorities, and 24/7 emergency contact protocols.

**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Prerequisites (Personnel Requirements — competency verification), Procedure Step 4.2 (Site Induction and Training)

### Coordination and Interfaces

#### Terminal Operations Interface

The OHS Plan must address coordination with DP World Fraser Surrey Terminal operations:

**Key Interfaces:**
- **Access Control:** Coordination with Terminal gate security, site-specific orientation
- **Work Permits:** Integration of Contractor permit-to-work with Terminal's system (hot work, confined space, excavation)
- **Emergency Response:** Defined roles in Terminal emergency scenarios, communication protocols, muster points
- **Traffic Management:** Construction equipment movements coordinated with Terminal logistics
- **Noise/Vibration:** Restrictions during vessel loading operations or sensitive activities

**Guidance:** Establish joint HSE coordination meetings (cross-reference PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces). Document interface agreements with Terminal.

**Source:** OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity; Employer: DP World Fraser Surrey Inc.; Cross-reference PKG-34; Specification PR-1 (Terminal Continuity), IR-1 (Employer Interface)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 4.1 (Terminal Interface — establish communication protocols), Example 2 (Terminal Interface Coordination Protocol)

#### Multi-Package Coordination

With 36 packages across multiple disciplines, HSE coordination is critical:

**Coordination Mechanisms:**
- **Weekly HSE Coordination Meetings:** Review upcoming high-risk activities, shared work areas, lessons learned
- **Work Area Isolation:** Define package boundaries and shared areas, manage interfaces (e.g., civil earthworks overlapping with underground utilities)
- **Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS):** Assess risks when multiple packages work in proximity (e.g., crane operations over active piping installation)
- **Change Management:** Process for HSE re-assessment when scope, schedule, or methods change

**Guidance:** The OHS Plan should require SIMOPS risk assessments (DEL-33.02) and coordination protocols. Define "shared work area" criteria.

**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 2.4 (Cross-Document Integration), Procedure Step 4.3 (SIMOPS Management), Procedure Step 4.7 (weekly coordination meetings)

#### Environmental Integration

The OHS Plan must integrate with environmental management:

**Interface Points:**
- **CEMP Compliance (DEL-33.04):** Environmental monitoring, erosion and sediment control, dust suppression
- **SPPP (DEL-33.05):** Stormwater management, BMP inspections, non-stormwater discharge controls
- **Waste Management (DEL-33.06):** Hazardous waste handling (used oil, contaminated materials), disposal manifests
- **Waterway Pollution Control (DEL-33.08):** Spill prevention and response for marine and waterway interfaces

**Guidance:** Designate Environmental Coordinator role to manage these interfaces. Ensure incident reporting captures environmental incidents.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Prescriptive vs. Performance-Based Controls

**Tension:** Prescriptive controls (detailed procedures, rigid checklists) provide consistency and are easier to audit. Performance-based controls (outcome-focused, worker discretion) enable flexibility and innovation but require higher competency.

**Considerations:**
- **High-Risk Activities:** Prescriptive approach (e.g., confined space entry permits, critical lift plans) reduces variability and error
- **Routine Activities:** Performance-based approach (e.g., general housekeeping, tool inspection) empowers workers and avoids bureaucracy
- **Competency:** Performance-based controls require higher worker training and judgment
- **Auditability:** Prescriptive controls generate clear compliance evidence for inspections

**Guidance:** The OHS Plan should use a hybrid approach — prescriptive for high-consequence hazards, performance-based for routine risks. Document the rationale for each approach.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: HSE control strategy trade-off; Specification FR-5 (Safe Work Procedures — SWMS and permits for high-risk activities)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Step 4.4 (Safe Work Procedures and Permits — prescriptive permits for specified hazardous tasks)

### Trade-off 2: Centralized vs. Distributed HSE Resources

**Tension:** Centralized HSE team (fewer, more specialized personnel) provides consistency and expertise. Distributed HSE team (embedded in each package) provides proximity and responsiveness.

**Considerations:**
- **Project Scale:** 36 packages across large site area favors distributed model
- **Expertise:** Centralized team concentrates expertise (e.g., industrial hygiene, incident investigation)
- **Cost:** Distributed model has higher headcount; centralized model may create bottlenecks
- **Visibility:** Distributed model increases HSE visibility and accessibility to workers

**Guidance:** The OHS Plan should use a matrix model — centralized HSE Manager and specialists, with HSE Coordinators embedded in major packages/disciplines. Define reporting and escalation paths.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: HSE organizational trade-off; Decomposition: 36 packages; Specification FR-2 (Organization and Responsibilities)
**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Organizational Considerations (HSE Organizational Structure — matrix model), Procedure Step 2.3 (Section 2)

### Trade-off 3: Plan Completeness vs. Agility

**Tension:** Comprehensive OHS Plan (hundreds of pages, detailed procedures) provides thorough coverage but is difficult to maintain and navigate. Concise OHS Plan (framework only) is agile but may lack detail for complex scenarios.

**Considerations:**
- **D&B Context:** Design evolving during construction requires agile plan that can adapt
- **Regulatory Expectations:** WorkSafeBC inspectors expect substantive documented program
- **User Accessibility:** Workers and supervisors need quick access to relevant procedures
- **Maintenance:** Detailed plan requires significant effort to update as project evolves

**Guidance:** The OHS Plan should be a tiered document:
- **Tier 1:** Framework document (policy, organization, processes) — stable, infrequently revised
- **Tier 2:** Activity-specific procedures (SWMS, permits) — dynamic, updated as needed, cross-reference DEL-33.03
- **Tier 3:** Forms and checklists — operational tools, revised frequently

This approach balances completeness with maintainability.

**Procedure Cross-Reference:** Procedure Section 3 (Managing OHS Plan Revisions), Example 1 (Integrated HSE Plan Structure — tiered approach)

### Trade-off 4: Compliance vs. Leading Practice

**Tension:** Compliance-focused OHS Plan meets regulatory minimums (WorkSafeBC) at lower cost. Leading-practice OHS Plan exceeds regulations (e.g., contractor HSE management system certifications, advanced monitoring) at higher cost but may reduce incidents and improve reputation.

**Considerations:**
- **Regulatory Floor:** OBJ-6 (Regulatory Compliance) establishes compliance as non-negotiable minimum
- **Risk Profile:** High-risk project (marine, heavy lifting, confined space, active terminal) may warrant leading practice
- **Employer Expectations:** DP World Fraser Surrey Inc. may have corporate HSE standards exceeding WorkSafeBC
- **Cost-Benefit:** Leading practice may reduce incident costs (downtime, investigations, penalties) and improve morale

**Guidance:** The OHS Plan should commit to compliance as minimum and identify leading practices to be adopted (e.g., ISO 45001 alignment, behavioral safety observations, predictive safety analytics). Document rationale for leading practices.
