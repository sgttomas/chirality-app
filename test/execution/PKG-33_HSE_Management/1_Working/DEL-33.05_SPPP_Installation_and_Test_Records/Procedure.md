# Procedure: DEL-33.05 SPPP Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Defines how to collect, manage, and report SPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan) compliance records during construction.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 733

## Prerequisites

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- DEL-33.01 (OHS Plan Section 10, FR-10, Procedure Step 4.8)
- SPPP (project plan) — **TBD**
- Stormwater discharge permit (PKG-32)
- Environmental Coordinator appointed

**Source:** Specification; DEL-33.01; DEL-33.04 (similar record type)

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Stormwater Monitoring Program
1. Review SPPP and stormwater permits for BMP inspection and monitoring requirements
2. Develop inspection schedule (weekly, post-rain event >10mm)
3. Identify monitoring personnel (Environmental Coordinator, QA/QC)
4. Procure monitoring equipment (sampling kits, turbidity meter)
5. Engage laboratory for water quality analysis (if required by permit)
6. Prepare record templates (BMP inspection checklist, monitoring log)

**Output:** Stormwater monitoring program established

**Source:** Specification FR-1, FR-2; Datasheet Monitoring Parameters

### Step 2: Conduct BMP Inspections and Monitoring
1. **Routine Inspections:** Weekly BMP inspections (silt fence, inlet protection, stabilized entrance, material storage, concrete washout)
2. **Event-Driven Inspections:** Within 24 hours of rain event >10mm
3. **Stormwater Discharge Monitoring:** Sample discharge at outfalls per permit schedule (TSS, pH, hydrocarbons)
4. **Document:** Inspection forms, monitoring data, photos
5. **Corrective Actions:** Repair/maintain BMPs immediately; document corrective actions

**Output:** BMP inspection records, monitoring data

**Source:** Specification FR-1 through FR-4; Datasheet BMP Elements

### Step 3: Compile and Report
1. Compile records per permit schedules (monthly, quarterly, annually)
2. Prepare compliance reports (summary of inspections, monitoring results, exceedances, corrective actions)
3. Submit to regulatory agencies and Employer (as required by permits)
4. Archive records

**Output:** SPPP compliance reports, archived records

**Source:** Specification Documentation; similar to DEL-33.04

## Verification

- BMP inspection records complete (per schedule)
- Monitoring meets permit requirements (parameters, frequency)
- Corrective actions documented and closed

**Source:** Specification Verification

## Records

- BMP inspection records
- Stormwater monitoring data
- Dewatering discharge records
- BMP maintenance logs
- Compliance reports

**Location:** Environmental database / `3_Issued/`
