# Specification: DEL-33.05 SPPP Installation & Test Records

## Scope

Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for SPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan) compliance.

**Anticipated Artifacts:** Stormwater monitoring records, BMP inspection records

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 733

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: BMP Inspection Records
Document inspection of Best Management Practices (BMPs):
- Sediment controls, stabilized entrance, material storage, concrete washout
- Inspection frequency: weekly or within 24 hours of rain event >10mm
- Condition assessment, deficiencies, corrective actions

**Source:** Datasheet BMP Elements; ASSUMPTION: SPPP inspection requirements

#### FR-2: Stormwater Outfall Monitoring
Document stormwater discharge quality per permit:
- Sampling date/time, outfall location, flow estimate
- Parameters: TSS, pH, hydrocarbons (per permit)
- Results vs. limits, exceedances, corrective actions

**Source:** Datasheet Monitoring Parameters; TBD: Discharge permit conditions

#### FR-3: Dewatering Discharge Records
Document excavation dewatering discharge (if applicable):
- Discharge volume, treatment (if required), discharge location
- Discharge quality monitoring (if required by permit)

**Source:** Datasheet BMP Elements; Cross-reference PKG-03 (excavation/dewatering)

#### FR-4: Non-Stormwater Discharge Controls
Document controls for non-stormwater discharges:
- Concrete washout containment and waste disposal
- Vehicle/equipment washing (if permitted)
- Prohibition of unauthorized discharges

**Source:** Datasheet BMP Elements; ASSUMPTION: SPPP non-stormwater discharge controls

### Interface Requirements

#### IR-1: CEMP Interface
SPPP records coordinate with CEMP records (DEL-33.04) for integrated water quality management.

**Source:** Cross-reference DEL-33.04; DEL-33.01 Procedure Step 4.8

#### IR-2: Waterway Pollution Control Interface
SPPP records interface with waterway pollution control (DEL-33.08) for spill prevention/response.

**Source:** Cross-reference DEL-33.08
