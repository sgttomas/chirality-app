# Guidance: DEL-33.05 SPPP Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

SPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan) records provide evidence that stormwater BMPs (Best Management Practices) are installed, inspected, maintained, and effective.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`; DEL-33.01 Specification FR-10

## Principles

### Principle 1: Stormwater is a Pathway for Pollutants
Stormwater runoff can carry sediment, chemicals, concrete washwater, and debris to waterways. BMPs interrupt this pathway.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Stormwater pollution prevention principle; OBJ-7 Environmental Protection

### Principle 2: Maintenance is Critical
BMPs are only effective if maintained. A silt fence full of sediment no longer filters runoff. Regular inspection and maintenance are essential.

## Considerations

### Fraser River Sensitivity
Project adjacent to Fraser River requires robust stormwater controls and monitoring to prevent waterway contamination.

### SPPP vs. CEMP Relationship
SPPP (stormwater-focused) is typically a component of broader CEMP (all environmental aspects). Records may overlap with DEL-33.04.

**Source:** Interface with DEL-33.04; ASSUMPTION: SPPP as subset of CEMP

## Examples

### Example: BMP Inspection Record

**Date:** 2026-04-10 | **Rain Event:** 18mm overnight | **Inspector:** Environmental Coordinator

| BMP | Location | Condition | Corrective Action |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Silt Fence | Perimeter | Fair — 50% capacity | Clean out sediment |
| Inlet Protection | Storm drain #3 | Good | None |
| Concrete Washout | Tank farm | Full — 90% capacity | Pump out, dispose waste |
