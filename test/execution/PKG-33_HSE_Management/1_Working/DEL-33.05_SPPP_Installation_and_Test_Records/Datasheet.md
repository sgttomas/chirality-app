### SPPP/BMP Elements Requiring Monitoring

| BMP Type | Monitoring/Record Type | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| Sediment Control | Silt fencing, sediment traps, inlet protection — inspection and maintenance | Interface with DEL-33.04 CEMP (ESC component); ASSUMPTION: Stormwater BMPs |
| Stabilized Construction Entrance | Gravel pad, wheel wash — inspection, sweeping records | ASSUMPTION: Prevent sediment tracking onto roads |
| Material Storage & Containment | Secondary containment for chemicals/fuel, covered storage — inspection | ASSUMPTION: Prevent stormwater contamination; spill prevention |
| Concrete Washout | Designated washout area, containment, waste disposal | ASSUMPTION: Prevent cement/concrete discharge to stormwater |
| Dewatering Discharge | Discharge location, treatment (if required), discharge quality monitoring | ASSUMPTION: Excavation dewatering (PKG-02, PKG-03); TBD: Discharge permit |
| Stormwater Outfall Monitoring | Outfall discharge quality (TSS, pH, hydrocarbons, etc.) | TBD: Stormwater discharge permit parameters |

### Monitoring Parameters (Anticipated)

| Parameter | Typical Limit | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Total Suspended Solids (TSS) | <50 mg/L (typical) | TBD: Stormwater discharge permit limit |
| pH | 6.5-8.5 (typical) | TBD: Permit limit |
| Hydrocarbons (oil & grease) | <10 mg/L (typical) | TBD: Permit limit |
| Turbidity | Visual (no visible sheen or discoloration) | ASSUMPTION: Visual monitoring requirement |

## Conditions

**Project Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal (adjacent to Fraser River) — stormwater discharge to river or municipal storm system
**Regulatory Environment:** Provincial/municipal stormwater permits
**Active Terminal:** Stormwater controls must not impact terminal drainage

**Source:** Decomposition Section 1; OBJ-5, OBJ-6, OBJ-7

## Construction

### Record Types

- BMP inspection records (weekly or post-rain event)
- Stormwater outfall monitoring data
- Dewatering discharge records (if applicable)
- BMP maintenance logs (repairs, replacements)
- Non-stormwater discharge records (concrete washout, vehicle washing)
- Spill incident reports (stormwater-related)
- Regulatory inspection records
