## Purpose

Waste management records demonstrate regulatory compliance for construction waste disposal and support waste diversion objectives.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`; OBJ-6, OBJ-7

## Principles

### Principle 1: Waste Hierarchy
Reduce > Reuse > Recycle > Dispose. Prioritize waste reduction and recycling over landfill disposal.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Waste management best practice

### Principle 2: Cradle-to-Grave Tracking
Generator (Contractor) is responsible for waste from generation to final disposal. Manifests provide proof of proper disposal.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Hazardous waste regulatory principle

## Considerations

### Hazardous Waste Regulatory Requirements
BC Hazardous Waste Regulation requires manifests for hazardous waste transport and disposal. Non-compliance = regulatory penalties.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: BC regulatory framework; OBJ-6 Regulatory Compliance

### Waste Segregation
Proper segregation at source (separate bins for hazardous, recyclable, general) reduces disposal costs and supports recycling.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Waste management efficiency
