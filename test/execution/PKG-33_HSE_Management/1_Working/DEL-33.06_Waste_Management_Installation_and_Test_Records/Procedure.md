# Procedure: DEL-33.06 Waste Management Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Defines how to collect, manage, and report waste management records during construction.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md`, Decomposition line 734

## Prerequisites

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- DEL-33.01 (OHS Plan Section 10, FR-10 — waste management interface)
- Waste Management Plan (if separate from CEMP) — **TBD**
- Waste disposal contracts (hazardous waste transporter, recycling vendors, landfill)

**Source:** DEL-33.01; Specification

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Waste Management Program
1. Identify waste types (hazardous, recyclable, general)
2. Engage disposal vendors (licensed hazardous waste transporter, recycling, landfill)
3. Procure waste bins (segregated, labeled)
4. Train personnel (waste segregation, hazardous waste handling)
5. Prepare record templates (manifests, tracking logs)

**Output:** Waste management program established

**Source:** Specification FR-1 through FR-4; Datasheet Waste Types

### Step 2: Manage Waste During Construction
1. **Segregation:** Separate waste at source (hazardous, recyclable, general bins)
2. **Storage:** Store waste properly (covered, contained, labeled)
3. **Hazardous Waste:** Complete manifest for each shipment (generator, transporter, receiver signatures)
4. **Non-Hazardous Waste:** Track type, quantity, disposal location, date
5. **Recycling:** Track materials diverted, obtain recycling receipts
6. **Inspect:** Monthly waste bin inspections (segregation, containment, labeling)

**Output:** Waste disposal manifests, tracking logs, bin inspection records

**Source:** Specification FR-1 through FR-4; Datasheet Record Types

### Step 3: Compile and Report
1. Compile waste records monthly/quarterly
2. Calculate waste diversion rate (if required)
3. Report to Employer (if required by ER)
4. Archive manifests and tracking records

**Output:** Waste management reports, archived records

**Source:** Specification Documentation

## Verification

- Manifests complete (all hazardous waste shipments have signed manifests)
- Tracking logs maintained (all waste documented)
- Regulatory compliance (hazardous waste managed per BC regulations)
- Waste diversion targets met (if applicable)

**Source:** Specification Verification

## Records

- Hazardous waste manifests
- Non-hazardous waste tracking logs
- Recycling receipts and diversion records
- Waste bin inspection records

**Location:** Environmental database / `3_Issued/`
