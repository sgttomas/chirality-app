# Guidance: DEL-12.05 Metering Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Metering Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-12 Product Transfer & Metering**.

DEL-12.05 provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for custody transfer metering (Source: Decomposition:360). The deliverable is classified as a **Record** under the **Process** discipline, produced by the **D&B Contractor (QA/QC)**.

### Deliverable Intent

The metering installation and test records serve as auditable evidence that:
- Custody transfer meters were properly installed and calibrated
- Meter accuracy was verified to meet specification requirements
- Calibration is traceable to recognized measurement standards

These records close the quality loop from specification (DEL-12.02) through installation, demonstrating compliance with project and regulatory requirements.

## Principles

### Record Development Rationale

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Evidence of Compliance | Records demonstrate that custody transfer metering meets DEL-12.02 specification acceptance criteria |
| Traceability | Each record must be traceable to specific equipment (tag/serial) and acceptance criteria |
| Auditability | Records must be complete, legible, and organized for third-party audit |
| Regulatory Support | Custody transfer calibration records may be required for regulatory compliance (Measurement Canada, etc.) |

### Custody Transfer Record Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Calibration Traceability | Calibration certificates must show unbroken traceability chain to national measurement standards |
| Proving Documentation | Proving records must document method, results, and acceptance verification per applicable standard |
| Witnessing | Third-party or client witnessing may be required for custody transfer verification |

### Objective Alignment

| Objective | Record Guidance |
|-----------|-----------------|
| OBJ-10 Custody Transfer Accuracy | Records provide auditable evidence of calibration and accuracy verification; demonstrating that installed metering meets custody transfer accuracy requirements (Source: Decomposition:789) |

## Considerations

### Record Content Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Minimum Content | At minimum: calibration certificates and accuracy verification records (Decomposition:360) |
| Equipment Coverage | Records required for all custody transfer meters and compensation transmitters |
| Acceptance Criteria | Each verification record must state acceptance criteria and demonstrate compliance |
| Witnessing Requirements | Confirm witnessing requirements from ER and applicable standards |

### Calibration Certificate Considerations

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| Equipment Identification | Tag number, serial number, manufacturer, model |
| Calibration Date | Date of calibration |
| Calibration Standard | Reference standard used, with traceability statement |
| Calibration Range | Range calibrated vs. operating range |
| Results | As-found and as-left values |
| Uncertainty | Calibration uncertainty statement |
| Calibrator | Calibrating organization, technician, certifications |
| Next Calibration | Recommended recalibration interval |

### Accuracy Verification / Proving Record Considerations

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| Proving Method | In-line prover, portable prover, or master meter |
| Proving Date | Date of proving |
| Proving Conditions | Flow rate, temperature, pressure during proving |
| Proving Runs | Individual run results, repeatability |
| Meter Factor | Calculated meter factor |
| Acceptance Criteria | Stated acceptance criteria (repeatability, meter factor limits) |
| Acceptance Verification | Pass/fail determination with signature |
| Witness | Third-party or client witness signature (if required) |

### Service-Specific Considerations

| Service | Record Considerations |
|---------|----------------------|
| Rail Unloading Meter | Calibration and proving records specific to rail unloading service conditions |
| Marine Loading Meter | Calibration and proving records specific to marine loading service conditions |

## Trade-offs

### Competing Factors

| Trade-off | Options | Guidance |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Proving Depth vs. Schedule | Comprehensive proving takes time; limited proving may not satisfy requirements | Comply with ER and specification requirements; escalate if schedule conflict |
| Vendor Certificates vs. Project Templates | Vendor certificates may not include all project-required fields | Supplement vendor certificates with project cover sheets mapping to requirements |
| Third-Party Witnessing vs. Cost | Third-party witnessing adds cost and coordination | Confirm witnessing requirements from ER; implement where required |

### Timing Considerations

| Stage | Record Status |
|-------|---------------|
| Factory Acceptance Test | Vendor calibration certificates |
| Site Installation | Installation verification records |
| Pre-Commissioning | Field calibration verification, loop checks |
| Commissioning | Proving / accuracy verification records |
| Handover | Complete record package compilation |

## Examples

### Record Content Reference

The anticipated artifacts provide guidance on expected content (Source: Decomposition:360):

| Artifact | Expected Content |
|----------|------------------|
| Calibration Certificates | Vendor factory calibration certificates for flow meters and transmitters; traceability statements |
| Accuracy Verification Records | Proving run data, meter factor calculation, repeatability verification, acceptance statement |
