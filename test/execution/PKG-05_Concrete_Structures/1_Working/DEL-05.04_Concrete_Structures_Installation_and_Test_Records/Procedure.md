   - Take cylinder samples per testing frequency:
     - Label cylinders with unique sample ID
     - Record sample ID, pour number, location, date/time, sampler ID
     - Initiate field curing per specification

   - Repair: Define repair procedure, materials, acceptance criteria
   - Accept as-is: Provide engineering justification (structural adequacy, no impact)
   - Reject: Define removal/replacement requirements
   - Document disposition decision and approval

4. **Implement corrective action:**
   - Implement repair or corrective action per disposition
   - Document repair procedure and materials used
   - Re-inspect repaired area and verify acceptance

5. **Close NCR:**
