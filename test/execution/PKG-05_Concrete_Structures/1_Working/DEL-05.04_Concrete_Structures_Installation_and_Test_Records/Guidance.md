# Guidance: DEL-05.04 Concrete Structures Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

- Guide production of the **Concrete Structures Installation & Test Records** package so it captures evidence required for concrete quality and compliance. (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:235.)
- Emphasize traceability and quality documentation for containment-related concrete works to support OBJ-7 Environmental Protection. (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786.)
- Ensure records support project handover, warranty, and operational requirements. (Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:58.)

## Principles

**P-01: Traceability (Complete Documentation Trail)**
Each record should enable complete traceability from design to installation to acceptance:
- **Element identification:** Clearly identify what element was inspected/tested (foundation F-1, wall W-2, pad P-3, etc.)
- **Drawing reference:** Reference specific DEL-05.01 drawing number, detail, and revision
- **Specification reference:** Reference DEL-05.02 mix ID, acceptance criteria, and requirements
- **Personnel identification:** Identify inspector, tester, supervisor, approver
- **Temporal tracking:** Date and time stamps for all activities
- **Unique identifiers:** Pour numbers, inspection numbers, sample numbers for cross-referencing
**ASSUMPTION:** Standard QA record practice; specific project conventions TBD from project QA/document control.
(Source: Specification.md: FR-05; test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD.)

**P-02: Real-Time Documentation (Document as Work Proceeds)**
Records should be completed in real-time during inspection/testing activities, not after the fact:
- Rebar inspection: Complete during inspection before concrete placement (hold point)
- Pour record: Complete during concrete placement (note issues/interruptions as they occur)
- Cylinder sampling: Complete at time of sampling (sample ID, location, date/time)
- Approval signatures: Obtain at time of acceptance decision (not backdated)
**Rationale:** Real-time documentation ensures accuracy, prevents forgetting details, and supports hold point enforcement.

**P-03: Containment Focus (Enhanced Documentation for OBJ-7)**
Containment-related concrete works require enhanced documentation to support OBJ-7 Environmental Protection:
- **Containment walls:** Extra attention to crack control verification (cover measurements, placement quality)
- **Joints:** Detailed documentation of construction joint preparation and waterstop installation
- **Quality control:** Enhanced inspection frequency for containment-critical elements
- **Acceptance criteria:** Strict enforcement of specification limits for containment structures
- **Photography:** Consider photographic documentation of critical containment details (joints, waterstops, penetrations)
**TBD:** Specific enhanced inspection requirements from Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Part 2.
(Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; Specification.md: PR-02; DEL-05.02 Specification: PR-03.)

**P-04: Objective Evidence (Facts, Not Opinions)**
Records should document objective, measurable evidence:
- Measurements with units (cover = 75 mm, not "adequate cover")
- Test results with values (strength = 32 MPa, not "passed")
- Specific observations (3 honeycomb voids 50mm × 50mm at grid B-3, not "some honeycomb")
- Acceptance decisions with criteria (strength 32 MPa ≥ required 30 MPa = ACCEPT, not just "OK")
- Avoid subjective terms ("good," "adequate," "acceptable") without quantification

**P-05: Completeness Before Archival**
Records should be complete before archival (no blank fields, all signatures obtained):
- All required fields populated
- All approvals and sign-offs obtained
- All cross-references verified (pour record links to cylinder samples, rebar inspection links to pour record)
- All NCRs closed with dispositions
- Index and summary complete
(Source: Specification.md: QR-02; Procedure.md: Verification.)

## Considerations

**C-01: Record Coverage vs Schedule Impact**
Increasing inspection frequency/detail increases confidence but may slow construction:
- **Risk-based approach:** Increased frequency for critical elements (containment walls, tank foundations), standard frequency for routine elements (typical pads, thrust blocks)
- **Balance:** Follow DEL-05.02 specification requirements as minimum; increase frequency if quality concerns arise
- **Hold points:** Enforce hold points consistently (rebar inspection before concrete placement); delays here prevent larger rework later
- **TBD:** Specific inspection frequencies from Employer's Requirements and DEL-05.02 specification
(Source: test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:786; DEL-05.02 Specification: FR-06; Guidance.md: P-03.)

**C-02: Record Format and Templates**
Standardized record formats improve completeness and consistency:
- **Templates:** Use project-standard templates with pre-populated fields (reduces missing data)
- **Electronic systems:** Consider electronic data collection (tablets, forms) if project supports (faster, more legible, easier to search)
- **Paper forms:** If using paper, ensure forms are legible, complete, and protected from weather/damage
- **Backup:** Maintain backup copies (electronic backup, photo copies) before archival
- **TBD:** Project-specific record templates and electronic system requirements from project QA/document control
(Source: Specification.md: IR-02; test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD.)

**C-03: Non-Conformance Management**
Clear NCR process ensures deficiencies are tracked and resolved:
- **Identification:** Clearly identify deficiency (what, where, severity)
- **Investigation:** Investigate root cause (why it happened, how to prevent recurrence)
- **Disposition:** Engineering disposition (repair, accept as-is with justification, reject)
- **Corrective action:** Implement repair or corrective action
- **Re-inspection:** Verify corrective action effectiveness
- **Closure:** Close NCR with approval signatures
- **Trending:** Track NCR frequency/types to identify systemic issues
- **TBD:** NCR procedures and forms from project QA system
(Source: Specification.md: FR-06; test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD.)

**C-04: Interface Documentation**
Records should document interfaces with other disciplines:
- **Embedded items:** Verify and document embedded items before concrete placement (sleeves, anchor bolts, plates)
- **Coordinate with other packages:** PKG-14 piping (thrust blocks, sleeves), PKG-17 electrical (conduit sleeves), PKG-10/11/13/15 equipment (anchor bolts)
- **Hold points:** Coordinate hold point releases with interdisciplinary schedule
- **Traceability:** Reference other discipline documents in records (equipment anchor bolt drawings, piping thrust loads)
(Source: Specification.md: IR-01; DEL-05.02 Specification: IR-02; test/Canola_Oil_Transload_Facility_Decomposition_REVISED_v2.md:49.)

**C-05: Record Retention and Access**
Records must be retained and accessible for project duration and beyond:
- **Archival:** Archive records systematically (by element, by date, by type — **TBD** organization method)
- **Indexing:** Maintain index of all records (pour numbers, inspection numbers, sample numbers with locations)
- **Access:** Ensure records are accessible for review (warranty claims, operational issues, future modifications)
- **Retention:** Follow project retention requirements (typically 7-10 years or facility lifetime)
- **Backup:** Maintain secure backup (off-site or cloud backup for electronic records)
- **TBD:** Specific retention periods and archival procedures from project document control
(Source: Specification.md: QR-01; Datasheet.md: Attributes; test/Volume_2_Part_1_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD.)

## Trade-offs

**T-01: Inspection Frequency vs Schedule/Cost**
More frequent inspection provides better quality assurance but increases cost and may slow construction:
- **Increased frequency benefits:** Earlier defect detection, better quality control, more data for acceptance decisions
- **Increased frequency costs:** More inspector time, more hold points (construction delays), more records to process
- **Balance approach:** Follow DEL-05.02 specification frequencies as baseline; increase for critical elements or if quality concerns arise
- **Risk-based:** Focus enhanced inspection on high-risk elements (containment walls, tank foundations, seismic details)

**T-02: Paper vs Electronic Records**
Electronic records offer advantages but require system support:
- **Electronic benefits:** Faster data entry, easier to search/retrieve, automatic calculations, built-in validation, real-time data sharing
- **Electronic costs:** System setup/training, tablet/device costs, system maintenance, data security requirements
- **Paper benefits:** Simple, no system required, works in all conditions
- **Paper limitations:** Slower, less legible, harder to search, easier to lose
- **Decision:** Depends on project QA system capabilities and preferences (**TBD**)

**T-03: Real-Time Documentation vs Post-Activity Documentation**
Real-time documentation is more accurate but requires disciplined field practice:
- **Real-time benefits:** More accurate, captures details that might be forgotten, supports hold point enforcement
- **Real-time challenges:** Field conditions (weather, safety, time pressure), requires discipline and training
- **Post-activity risk:** Details forgotten, timestamps inaccurate, hold points bypassed
- **Best practice:** Document in real-time (even if rough notes), transcribe to final form later if needed, but capture key data immediately
