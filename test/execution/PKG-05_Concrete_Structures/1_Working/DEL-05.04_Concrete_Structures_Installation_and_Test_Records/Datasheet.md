## Cross-Document Notes

- **Specification → Requirements:** Each record artifact (pour records, cylinder tests, rebar inspections) listed in Construction must be explicitly required in `Specification.md` §FR-01 through §FR-06 with field requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **DEL-05.02 → Inspection/Testing Requirements:** Record content must capture all inspection and testing requirements specified in DEL-05.02 (§FR-06 concrete quality control, §FR-09 reinforcement inspection, §FR-12 formwork inspection).
- **DEL-05.01 → Drawing References:** Records must reference DEL-05.01 drawings to identify element locations and verify installation per design intent — tracked via `Specification.md` §FR-05 and §IR-01.
- **Procedure → Record Generation:** `Procedure.md` Steps 2-5 define the workflow that generates records. Each Construction artifact maps to a Procedure step per the Cross-Document Traceability table above.
- **Guidance → Containment Focus:** Containment wall records (OBJ-7 Environmental Protection) require special emphasis per `Guidance.md` §P-03 (crack control verification, joint quality, waterstop installation).
