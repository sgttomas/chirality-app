- Concrete strength requirements by element type (foundations, containment walls, equipment pads)
- Cover requirements by exposure class and element type
- Water-cement ratio limits by exposure class
- Air entrainment requirements for freeze-thaw protection
- Curing requirements by exposure class and seasonal conditions
- Reinforcement materials and detailing requirements (grades, types, lap splice requirements, couplers)
- Formwork materials, tolerances, and finish requirements
- Inspection and testing frequencies (slump, air content, temperature, cylinder sampling)
- Acceptance criteria and hold points
- Special requirements for containment-related concrete (joints, waterstops, penetrations, liner interfaces)
(Source: test/Volume_2_Part_2_Employers_Requirements.pdf, location TBD.)

## Cross-Document Points

- **Specification → Requirements:** Each specification artifact (concrete, reinforcement, formwork) listed in Construction must be explicitly required in `Specification.md` with acceptance criteria and verification methods.
- **Specification → Standards:** Material standards and codes referenced in Conditions must align with Standards section in `Specification.md`.
- **Procedure → Verification:** `Procedure.md` defines the review and verification workflow to ensure completeness, consistency, and traceability to Employer's Requirements.
- **Guidance → Durability/Containment Intent:** Durability and containment requirements (OBJ-7) must be emphasized in specification language as described in Principles in `Guidance.md`.
- **Related Deliverables:** This specification must align with:
  - DEL-05.01 drawing notes and details (material properties, cover, tolerances)
  - DEL-05.03 calculation assumptions (concrete strength, material properties)
  - DEL-05.04 inspection/testing requirements (enable record generation)
