# Guidance: DEL-34.04 Security Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Supports development of **Security Compliance Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Context:** Fraser Surrey Terminal is a secure port facility subject to CBSA (border security) and Transport Canada (marine security MTSR) regulations. Construction must maintain facility security and comply with regulatory requirements. Supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity.

**Deliverable classification:** Record / Project Delivery / D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Principles

### P1: Security is Non-Negotiable
Port facility security is mandated by federal regulations (CBSA, Transport Canada MTSR). Non-compliance results in regulatory enforcement, facility security level escalation, or construction shutdown. Security clearances, access control, and incident reporting are mandatory, not discretionary.

### P2: Early Clearance Processing Prevents Delays
Security clearances require 4-8 weeks processing time. Late applications delay personnel mobilization and construction start. Submit applications early in project planning.

### P3: Confidentiality and Need-to-Know
Security information is sensitive and confidential. Distribute security records on need-to-know basis only. Protect personnel privacy per privacy legislation.

### P4: Proactive Coordination with Regulatory Authorities
Maintain positive working relationship with CBSA, Transport Canada, and Terminal security. Proactive communication and compliance reduce regulatory scrutiny and facilitate smooth inspections.

**Standards:** CBSA border security regulations; Transport Canada MTSR; ISO 9001 (document control); ISO 45001 (site access, incident reporting)

## Considerations

### C1: Personnel Security Clearances
- Identify all personnel requiring restricted area access (construction workers, supervisors, engineers, subcontractors)
- Submit clearance applications early (6+ weeks before required access)
- Provide accurate personnel information (full legal name, date of birth, citizenship, work history)
- Track clearance status and follow up on delays
- Maintain clearance records (roster, approvals, expiry dates)

### C2: Site Access Control
- Issue badges only to personnel with valid security clearances
- Implement visitor management (escort requirements, visitor badges, time limits)
- Control vehicle access (authorized vehicles only, inspection protocols)
- Monitor restricted area access (logs, authorization checks)
- Deactivate lost/stolen badges immediately (security risk)

### C3: Security Awareness and Training
- Conduct security briefings for all personnel (security protocols, threat recognition, incident reporting)
- MARSEC level awareness (what each security level means and required actions)
- Reporting suspicious activity or security concerns
- Emergency response procedures (lockdown, evacuation, shelter-in-place)

### C4: Security Incidents
- Define security incidents (unauthorized access, security breaches, threats, suspicious activity)
- Immediate reporting protocol (to whom, how, within what timeframe)
- Secure incident scene; prevent tampering
- Investigate thoroughly; document findings
- Notify CBSA, Transport Canada, law enforcement as required
- Implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence

### C5: CBSA and Transport Canada Coordination
- Designate security coordinator liaison
- Respond promptly to regulatory inquiries or inspection requests
- Prepare for inspections (have records readily available)
- Address non-conformances promptly with corrective action plans
- Maintain positive relationship through transparency and cooperation

## Trade-offs

### T1: Clearance Thoroughness vs. Processing Time
- Thorough background checks (CBSA/TC review) ensure security but require longer processing time
- Expedited clearances may be available for urgent needs but have higher cost or limited scope
- Balance: Submit applications early; avoid last-minute requests

### T2: Access Control Rigor vs. Operational Efficiency
- Strict access control (badge checks, visitor escorts, vehicle inspections) enhances security but slows site access
- Relaxed controls speed access but increase security risk
- Balance: Implement proportionate controls based on MARSEC level and Terminal security requirements

### T3: Security Transparency vs. Confidentiality
- Transparent security practices build trust but may expose security vulnerabilities
- Confidential security information protects facility but limits stakeholder awareness
- Balance: Share security protocols on need-to-know basis; protect sensitive details

## Examples

### Example 1: Personnel Security Clearance Application Checklist
- Full legal name (as on government ID)
- Date of birth, citizenship
- Current address, contact information
- Employer name and address
- Role and duration of work at facility
- Work history (previous 5-10 years)
- Criminal record check (if required)
- References (if required)
- Submission to CBSA/TC portal or designated office
- Follow-up on clearance status (weekly)

### Example 2: Site Access Badge Format
```
FRASER SURREY TERMINAL — CONSTRUCTION ACCESS
Name: [Full Name]
Company: [Employer]
Badge No.: [Number]
Valid: [Start Date] to [End Date]
Clearance Level: [Level]
Authorized Signature: [Signature]
Photo: [Personnel Photo]
```

### Example 3: Security Incident Report (Sample)
**Incident Date/Time:** [Date, Time]
**Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, [Specific location]
**Reported By:** [Name, Company]
**Incident Type:** Unauthorized Access

**Description:** Individual without site access badge observed in restricted construction area. Individual was escorted off site by security personnel. No damage or theft occurred.

**Immediate Actions:** Individual identified and removed from site; area inspected for damage/theft (none found); Terminal security notified.

**Investigation:** Individual was subcontractor employee who had not yet obtained security clearance. Subcontractor failed to brief employee on access control requirements.

**Corrective Actions:**
1. Subcontractor to conduct security briefing for all employees before site mobilization
2. Enhanced badge check protocol at site entry gates
3. Signage installed: "Restricted Area — Authorized Personnel Only"

**Regulatory Notification:** CBSA notified per facility security plan requirements; no further action required by CBSA.
