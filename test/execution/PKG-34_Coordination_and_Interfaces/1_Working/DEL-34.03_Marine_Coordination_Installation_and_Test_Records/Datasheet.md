## Conditions

**Operating / Marine Context:**

This deliverable provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for marine coordination activities conducted throughout the construction phase at Fraser Surrey Terminal.

**Marine Environment Context:**
- **Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, Fraser River, Surrey, BC — active deep-water marine terminal
- **Waterway:** Fraser River — navigable waterway subject to Canadian Coast Guard and Transport Canada regulations
- **Facility type:** Active commercial transload terminal with concurrent vessel operations during construction
- **Marine operations:** Bulk liquid cargo loading/unloading via berth and loading arms; vessel berthing and unberthing operations
- **Objective alignment:** OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" — minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities, including marine operations (Decomposition line 63)

**Package scope context (marine-specific):**
- Marine coordination is a subset of PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces (Decomposition line 743 — "marine coordination")
- Related to marine construction activities (PKG-08 Marine Structures, PKG-09 Marine Outfitting, PKG-11 Marine Loading System)
- Coordination with general Terminal coordination (DEL-34.01) for holistic project coordination

**Marine Coordination Topics:**
- Vessel traffic management (berth scheduling, vessel movements, anchorage)
- Navigation safety (construction barges, work vessels, floating equipment)
- Berth operations (loading arm outages, fender system work, mooring equipment maintenance)
- Marine access restrictions (construction zones, exclusion areas, navigation hazards)
- Dredging and underwater work (if applicable)
- Marine environmental protection (spill response, debris management, water quality)
- Regulatory compliance (Transport Canada permits, Canadian Coast Guard notifications, vessel traffic services coordination)

**Marine Regulatory Context:**
- **Transport Canada:** Marine safety, navigation, vessel operations
- **Canadian Coast Guard:** Navigation aids, marine search and rescue, environmental response
- **Vessel Traffic Services (VTS):** Fraser River vessel traffic monitoring and coordination (MCTS Comox or VTS Vancouver)
- **Fraser River Pilots:** Pilotage services for vessels entering/leaving Fraser River
- **Port Authority (if applicable):** Fraser River Port Authority or Transport Canada regional office
- **TBD** — Specific regulatory requirements and coordination protocols

**Phase/Timing:**
- **TBD** — Marine coordination activities commence prior to any marine construction work and continue throughout construction phase
- **ASSUMPTION**: Marine coordination particularly critical during:
  - Marine construction mobilization (barges, work vessels, floating equipment arrival)
  - Berth and fender system construction/maintenance (requires berth outages or restrictions)
  - Marine loading arm installation/commissioning (requires loading arm outages)
  - Dredging or underwater work (if applicable)
  - Marine equipment delivery (large/heavy lifts via vessel)

## Construction

**Materials / Configuration:**

Anticipated artifacts (per Decomposition line 751, `_CONTEXT.md`):
- **Notices to Mariners** (primary artifact)
- **Marine coordination records** (supporting records)

**Record Types and Structure:**

### 1. Notices to Mariners (NOTMARs)

**Purpose:** Inform mariners of construction activities, navigation hazards, and marine access restrictions.

**Typical Content:**
- Notice number and issue date
- Effective dates (start and end of restriction/hazard)
- Location (geographic coordinates, chart datum, navigation chart references)
- Description of construction activity or navigation hazard (e.g., "Construction barge moored at Fraser Surrey Terminal Berth 2; clearance reduced to 50m")
- Restrictions or precautions (e.g., "Mariners advised to reduce speed and maintain safe distance")
- Contact information (D&B Contractor marine coordinator, emergency contact)
- Cancellation notice (when activity complete or hazard removed)

**Issuance:**
- Issued by D&B Contractor (via marine coordinator)
- Distributed to:
  - Canadian Coast Guard (for broadcasting via Notices to Mariners system)
  - Vessel Traffic Services (VTS Vancouver or MCTS Comox)
  - Fraser River Pilots
  - Terminal Marine Operations
  - Transport Canada (regional office)
  - Adjacent berth operators or tenants
- **TBD** — Distribution list and issuance protocol per project marine coordination plan

### 2. Marine Coordination Records

**Typical Records:**
- Marine coordination meeting minutes (with Terminal Marine Operations, vessel operators, pilots, VTS, regulators)
- Vessel schedules and berth availability (coordination with Terminal operations)
- Marine construction work permits (hot work, diving, underwater work)
- Marine equipment mobilization/demobilization records (barges, work vessels, floating equipment)
- Berth outage schedules and approvals (for construction work affecting berth operations)
- Loading arm outage schedules and approvals (for loading arm maintenance or new loading arm installation)
- Marine traffic management plans (for construction activities affecting vessel traffic)
- Dredging or underwater work records (if applicable)
- Marine environmental monitoring records (water quality, spill prevention, debris management)
- Marine incident reports (near-misses, navigational incidents, environmental incidents)
- Regulatory correspondence (Transport Canada, Canadian Coast Guard, VTS)

**Data Sources:**
- Marine coordination meetings (minutes and attendance)
- Vessel schedules (from Terminal Marine Operations)
- Construction schedules (marine construction activities)
- Work permit logs (marine work permits)
- Equipment mobilization logs (barges, work vessels)
- Regulatory submittals and approvals (Transport Canada, Canadian Coast Guard)
- Incident reports (marine safety incidents, environmental incidents)
- Photographic evidence (marine construction activities, navigation aids, signage)

**Preparation Method:**
- **TBD** — Marine coordination records prepared by D&B Contractor marine coordinator or site manager
- **ASSUMPTION**: Notices to Mariners prepared per Transport Canada and Canadian Coast Guard protocols; marine coordination records per project quality management plan

**Distribution:**
- **TBD** — Distribution list per project marine coordination plan and communication plan
- **ASSUMPTION**: Distribution to all marine stakeholders (Terminal Marine Operations, vessel operators, pilots, VTS, regulators, adjacent tenants)

**Archival:**
- Filed in project document management system under PKG-34
- Marine safety records (Notices to Mariners, incident reports) may require specific retention per Transport Canada regulations — **TBD**
