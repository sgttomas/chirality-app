# Guidance: DEL-34.03 Marine Coordination Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Marine Coordination Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Deliverable purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for marine coordination activities during construction (per Decomposition line 751, `_CONTEXT.md`).

**Project context:** Fraser Surrey Terminal is an active deep-water marine terminal on the Fraser River. Construction activities must be coordinated with ongoing vessel operations, navigation safety requirements, and marine regulatory authorities. Marine coordination supports OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" by minimizing disruption to commercial vessel operations (Decomposition lines 63, 784).

**Deliverable classification:** Record / Project Delivery / D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Principles

### P1: Marine Safety is Paramount

All marine coordination activities prioritize safety of navigation and vessel operations. Construction activities in or near navigable waters create hazards for mariners and vessel operators. Proper coordination through Notices to Mariners, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory compliance reduces marine safety risks and protects the project from liability.

**Source:** Transport Canada marine safety mandate; Canada Shipping Act; **ASSUMPTION**: Marine safety regulatory compliance.

### P2: Early and Continuous Stakeholder Engagement

Effective marine coordination requires early engagement with marine stakeholders (Terminal Marine Operations, vessel operators, pilots, VTS, Canadian Coast Guard, Transport Canada) and continuous coordination throughout construction. Last-minute notifications or inadequate coordination cause operational disruptions, schedule conflicts, and safety risks.

**Source:** OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity (Decomposition line 63); **ASSUMPTION**: Marine stakeholder engagement best practice per ISO 14001.

### P3: Clear and Timely Communication

Notices to Mariners must be clear, accurate, and timely. Mariners rely on Notices for navigation safety — vague descriptions, inaccurate coordinates, or late notices create confusion and hazards. Adequate advance notice allows vessel operators to plan alternative routes or schedules.

**Source:** Canadian Coast Guard Notices to Mariners protocols; **ASSUMPTION**: Marine communication best practice.

### P4: Integration with General Project Coordination

Marine coordination should be integrated with general Terminal coordination (DEL-34.01) to ensure consistent communication and avoid duplication. Marine-specific issues are addressed in dedicated marine coordination meetings or escalated per project procedures.

**Source:** Relation to DEL-34.01; **ASSUMPTION**: Integrated coordination approach for efficiency.

**Applicable standards context:**
- **Transport Canada** — Marine safety, navigation, vessel operations
- **Canadian Coast Guard** — Notices to Mariners, navigation aids, environmental response
- **ISO 9001** — Document control, stakeholder communication
- **ISO 14001** — Stakeholder engagement, environmental protection (marine)
- **ISO 45001** — Safety coordination, incident reporting (marine)

## Considerations

### C1: Navigation Safety Requirements

- **Hazard identification:** Identify all construction activities creating navigation hazards (barges, work vessels, floating equipment, underwater work, dredging)
- **Geographic accuracy:** Ensure accurate geographic coordinates and chart references for all hazard locations
- **Visibility and marking:** Ensure construction equipment is properly lit and marked per navigation aids regulations
- **Restricted areas:** Define and communicate marine access restrictions or exclusion zones
- **Emergency procedures:** Establish emergency response procedures for marine incidents (vessel collision, equipment failure, environmental spill)

**Source:** Transport Canada marine safety requirements; Canadian Coast Guard navigation aids regulations.

### C2: Vessel Operations Coordination

- **Berth availability:** Coordinate construction activities affecting berth availability with Terminal Marine Operations and vessel schedules
- **Loading arm outages:** Coordinate loading arm maintenance or installation with vessel loading operations
- **Vessel traffic:** Coordinate construction barge movements with commercial vessel traffic (minimize conflicts)
- **Pilot coordination:** Coordinate with Fraser River Pilots for pilotage requirements and constraints
- **Tug and assist:** Coordinate tug and marine assist requirements for construction barges or equipment

**Source:** OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity; **ASSUMPTION**: Vessel operations coordination best practice.

### C3: Regulatory Compliance and Approvals

- **Transport Canada permits:** Identify and obtain required permits (navigable waters protection, marine construction)
- **Canadian Coast Guard:** Comply with Notices to Mariners protocols and navigation aids regulations
- **Vessel Traffic Services:** Coordinate with VTS Vancouver or MCTS Comox per VTS regulations
- **Environmental approvals:** Obtain approvals for in-water work (dredging, pile driving, underwater construction)

**Source:** Transport Canada regulatory framework; **TBD**: Specific permit requirements per Employer's Requirements.

### C4: Marine Environmental Protection

- **Spill response:** Maintain marine spill response capability and equipment (booms, absorbents, recovery equipment)
- **Water quality:** Monitor water quality during in-water construction (turbidity, contaminants)
- **Debris management:** Prevent construction debris from entering water; recover any debris promptly
- **Marine wildlife:** Identify and protect sensitive marine habitats or species (fish spawning areas, marine mammals)

**Source:** ISO 14001 environmental management; Canadian Coast Guard environmental response protocols.

### C5: Marine Construction Equipment Management

- **Barge mobilization:** Coordinate barge and work vessel mobilization/demobilization with Terminal operations
- **Equipment inspection:** Ensure marine construction equipment is seaworthy and compliant with regulations
- **Mooring and anchoring:** Coordinate mooring locations and anchoring to avoid conflicts with vessel traffic or existing infrastructure
- **Marine contractor coordination:** Coordinate with marine construction subcontractors for schedule and safety protocols

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Marine construction management best practice.

## Trade-offs

### T1: Notice Timing vs. Construction Flexibility

- **Early notice (7+ days):** Allows mariners adequate planning time but reduces construction flexibility if schedules change
- **Short notice (72 hours):** Provides construction flexibility but may not give mariners adequate time to adjust plans
- **Trade-off consideration:** Balance marine safety (adequate notice) with construction efficiency; use early notices for planned activities and provide updates for schedule changes; reserve short-notice for emergencies only

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Marine coordination timing best practice.

### T2: Restricted Area Size vs. Operational Impact

- **Large restricted areas:** Provide greater construction safety buffer but cause more disruption to vessel traffic
- **Minimal restricted areas:** Reduce operational impact but increase marine safety risk (vessels closer to construction)
- **Trade-off consideration:** Define restricted areas based on actual hazard extent plus reasonable safety margin; review and adjust as construction progresses; coordinate exceptions with Terminal Operations and VTS

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Marine hazard zone definition best practice.

### T3: Meeting Frequency vs. Coordination Burden

- **Frequent marine coordination meetings (weekly):** Provide detailed coordination but consume significant time from marine stakeholders
- **Infrequent meetings (monthly):** Reduce meeting burden but may miss critical coordination windows
- **Trade-off consideration:** Adjust meeting frequency based on marine construction activity levels; integrate marine topics into general Terminal coordination meetings (DEL-34.01) where possible; use dedicated marine meetings for complex or high-risk activities

**Source:** Relation to DEL-34.01; **ASSUMPTION**: Meeting efficiency best practice.
