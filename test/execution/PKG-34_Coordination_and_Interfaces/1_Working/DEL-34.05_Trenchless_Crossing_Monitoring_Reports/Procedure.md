## Steps

### Step 1: Develop Monitoring Plan (During detailed design, before trenchless installation)

**1.1 Define Monitoring Objectives and Scope**
- Review trenchless crossing design and geotechnical design report
- Identify settlement monitoring objectives (verify settlement within design limits, protect infrastructure)
- Identify condition monitoring objectives (detect damage to infrastructure)
- Define monitoring scope (crossing locations, infrastructure types, monitoring duration)
- **Verification:** Monitoring objectives and scope defined

**1.2 Design Monitoring Point Layout**
- Determine settlement monitoring point locations (along crossing alignment and perpendicular transects)
- Determine condition inspection points (critical infrastructure elements)
- Prepare monitoring point location plan (drawing showing all monitoring points with coordinates)
- Coordinate monitoring point locations with infrastructure owners (ensure no conflicts with operations)
- **Verification:** Monitoring point layout designed and coordinated

**1.3 Select Instrumentation and Define Monitoring Frequency**
- Select settlement monitoring instrumentation (survey monuments, settlement gauges, inclinometers) based on accuracy requirements and site conditions
- Define monitoring frequency (daily during installation, weekly/monthly post-installation per Specification PR-1)
- Define instrumentation calibration and maintenance requirements
- **Verification:** Instrumentation selected; monitoring frequency defined

**1.4 Establish Alert and Action Thresholds**
- Define alert thresholds (conservatively, e.g., 50-75% of design limit)
- Define action thresholds (at design limits, per geotechnical design and infrastructure owner requirements)
- Document threshold response procedures
- **TBD** — Specific alert/action thresholds per geotechnical design and infrastructure owner coordination
- **Verification:** Thresholds defined and response procedures documented

**1.5 Prepare Monitoring Plan Document**
- Compile monitoring plan document including: Objectives, monitoring point layout, instrumentation, frequency, thresholds, reporting format
- Obtain approvals: Geotechnical engineer, infrastructure owners, D&B Contractor project management
- **Verification:** Monitoring plan approved

### Step 2: Install Instrumentation and Conduct Baseline Surveys (Before trenchless installation)

**2.1 Install Settlement Monitoring Instrumentation**
- Install survey monuments per monitoring plan (grouted into stable soil/rock)
- Survey monument coordinates and elevations (establish initial reference)
- Install settlement gauges/inclinometers (if applicable)
- Calibrate instrumentation per manufacturer specifications
- **Verification:** Instrumentation installed and calibrated

**2.2 Conduct Baseline Settlement Surveys**
- Conduct baseline settlement surveys (minimum 3 measurements over 2 weeks to verify stability)
- Record baseline elevations for all monitoring points
- Analyze baseline data (verify no significant pre-installation settlement or movement)
- **Verification:** Baseline settlement data collected and analyzed

**2.3 Conduct Baseline Condition Assessment**
- Conduct pre-installation condition assessment of infrastructure: Rail tracks (track geometry survey, photographs), Roads (pavement condition survey), Buildings (crack survey)
- Prepare baseline condition report with photographs and condition ratings
- Obtain infrastructure owner acknowledgment of baseline condition (if required)
- **Verification:** Baseline condition documented

### Step 3: Monitor During Trenchless Installation (Active installation period)

**3.1 Daily Settlement Monitoring**
- Conduct daily settlement surveys (morning before drilling, evening after drilling)
- Record settlement measurements in monitoring database
- Compare measurements to baseline and previous day (calculate daily settlement and cumulative settlement)
- Flag alert/action threshold exceedances immediately
- **Verification:** Daily settlement surveys conducted; data recorded

**3.2 Daily Condition Inspections**
- Conduct daily visual inspections of infrastructure (look for new cracks, distress, alignment changes)
- Photograph any condition changes
- Report condition concerns immediately to project management and infrastructure owner
- **Verification:** Daily inspections conducted

**3.3 Respond to Threshold Exceedances**
- If alert threshold exceeded: Notify geotechnical engineer; increase monitoring frequency; engineering review within 24 hours
- If action threshold exceeded: Suspend trenchless installation; notify project management, infrastructure owner, geotechnical engineer; investigate cause; develop corrective action plan; implement corrective actions
- **Verification:** Threshold exceedances responded to per monitoring plan

**3.4 Prepare Daily and Weekly Monitoring Reports**
- Prepare daily monitoring summaries (brief summary of measurements, flag threshold exceedances)
- Distribute daily summaries to project management, infrastructure owner, geotechnical engineer
- Prepare weekly comprehensive reports (detailed data tables, settlement charts, trend analysis, threshold compliance assessment, recommendations)
- **Verification:** Reports prepared and distributed per schedule

### Step 4: Post-Installation Monitoring (After trenchless installation complete)

**4.1 Continue Settlement Monitoring**
- Continue settlement monitoring at reduced frequency (weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly)
- Monitor until settlement stabilizes (no significant change for 2-3 consecutive measurements)
- Typical post-installation monitoring duration: 6-12 months for clayey soils, 3-6 months for sandy soils — **TBD**
- **Verification:** Post-installation monitoring conducted

**4.2 Post-Installation Condition Assessments**
- Conduct post-installation condition assessments per monitoring plan (immediate, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months)
- Compare to baseline condition (identify any new damage or distress)
- Prepare condition assessment reports with before/after photographs
- **Verification:** Post-installation condition assessments conducted

**4.3 Prepare Monthly/Quarterly Monitoring Reports**
- Prepare monthly or quarterly monitoring reports (per monitoring plan frequency)
- Include settlement trends, cumulative settlement, condition assessment updates
- **Verification:** Periodic reports prepared and distributed

### Step 5: Prepare Final Monitoring Report (At end of monitoring period)

**5.1 Compile Final Monitoring Data**
- Compile all settlement monitoring data (baseline through final measurement)
- Compile all condition monitoring data (baseline through final assessment)
- Compile threshold exceedance records and corrective actions (if any)
- **Verification:** Final monitoring data compiled

**5.2 Prepare Final Monitoring Report**
- Prepare comprehensive final monitoring report including: Executive summary, monitoring plan summary, baseline data, monitoring data, data analysis, threshold compliance assessment, infrastructure condition assessment, conclusions and recommendations, appendices
- Professional engineer review and seal (P.Eng.)
- **Verification:** Final report prepared and professionally reviewed

**5.3 Distribute Final Report and Obtain Approvals**
- Distribute final report to infrastructure owners, D&B Contractor, Employer, geotechnical engineer, regulatory authorities
- Obtain infrastructure owner acceptance/approval (if required)
- Obtain regulatory approval (if monitoring required for permits)
- **Verification:** Final report distributed; approvals obtained

### Step 6: Archive Monitoring Records (At project closeout)

**6.1 Compile Complete Monitoring Records Package**
- Monitoring plan, all monitoring reports, raw data, instrumentation calibration certificates, threshold exceedance notifications, infrastructure owner correspondence
- **Verification:** Records compiled

**6.2 Archive Records**
- Archive in project document management system under PKG-34
- Long-term retention per infrastructure monitoring requirements (typically 7+ years) — **TBD**
- Provide copy to Employer and infrastructure owners (as required)
- **Verification:** Records archived per retention requirements

## Verification

**Overall acceptance:** Settlement within design limits (or exceedances managed with corrective action); no unacceptable infrastructure damage; infrastructure owner acceptance; regulatory approval (if applicable)

**Sign-off:** Originator: Geotechnical engineer/monitoring specialist (P.Eng.); Reviewer: D&B Contractor project engineer; Approver: D&B Contractor project manager; External: Infrastructure owners, regulatory authorities (as applicable)

## Records

**Outputs:** Settlement monitoring reports (daily, weekly, monthly, final); Condition monitoring reports (baseline, post-installation assessments, final)
