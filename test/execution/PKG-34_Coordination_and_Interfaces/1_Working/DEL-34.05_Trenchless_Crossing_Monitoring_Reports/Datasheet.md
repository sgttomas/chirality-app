## Conditions

**Project / Infrastructure Crossing Context:**

This deliverable documents monitoring of trenchless utility crossings to verify that installation does not cause settlement or damage to existing infrastructure (supports design verification and regulatory approvals).

**Trenchless Crossing Applications:**
- **Utility crossings under rail lines:** Power, water, wastewater, telecommunications utilities crossing under railway tracks (avoid open-cut excavation that disrupts rail operations)
- **Utility crossings under roads:** Utilities crossing under major roads or highways
- **Other infrastructure crossings:** Crossings under rivers, buildings, or other sensitive infrastructure

**Trenchless Methods (typical):**
- **Horizontal directional drilling (HDD):** Most common for long crossings
- **Pipe jacking or microtunneling:** For larger diameter utilities or challenging soil conditions
- **Auger boring:** For short crossings
- **TBD** — Specific trenchless methods per project design

**Monitoring Objectives:**
1. **Settlement monitoring:** Measure ground settlement above and around trenchless crossing to verify settlement is within acceptable limits (design criteria, infrastructure owner requirements)
2. **Condition monitoring:** Inspect existing infrastructure (rail tracks, road pavement, buildings) before, during, and after trenchless installation to detect any damage or distress
3. **Design verification:** Verify trenchless installation performance matches design assumptions and predictions
4. **Regulatory compliance:** Provide monitoring data to support regulatory approvals (rail authority, road authority, environmental permits)

**Monitoring Triggers and Thresholds:**
- **Alert thresholds:** Settlement or movement approaching design limits; trigger increased monitoring frequency and engineering review
- **Action thresholds:** Settlement or movement exceeding design limits; trigger installation suspension and corrective action
- **TBD** — Specific thresholds per geotechnical design, infrastructure owner requirements, and regulatory permits

**Location Context:**
- Fraser Surrey Terminal and surrounding area
- Crossings of railway lines (Canadian Pacific Railway, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, or other rail operators) — **TBD**
- Crossings of roads or highways (if applicable) — **TBD**
- **TBD** — Specific crossing locations per project design

## Construction

**Materials / Configuration:**

Anticipated artifacts (per Decomposition line 753, `_CONTEXT.md`):
- **Settlement monitoring reports** (primary artifact)
- **Condition monitoring reports** (primary artifact)

**Report Types and Structure:**

### 1. Settlement Monitoring Reports

**Purpose:** Document ground settlement measurements during and after trenchless utility crossing installation.

**Typical Content:**
1. **Executive Summary:** Key findings, settlement magnitudes, comparison to design limits, recommendations
2. **Introduction:** Project description, crossing location, trenchless method, monitoring objectives
3. **Monitoring Plan:** Settlement monitoring point locations, instrumentation types (survey monuments, settlement gauges, inclinometers), monitoring frequency, alert/action thresholds
4. **Baseline Data:** Pre-installation settlement measurements (establish baseline for comparison)
5. **Monitoring Data:** Settlement measurements during and after installation (presented as tables, charts, time-series plots)
6. **Data Analysis:** Settlement trends, maximum settlement magnitudes, settlement contours, comparison to design predictions
7. **Assessment:** Comparison to alert/action thresholds, assessment of infrastructure impacts, geotechnical interpretation
8. **Recommendations:** Continue monitoring, adjust installation procedures, implement corrective actions (if thresholds exceeded)
9. **Appendices:** Monitoring point location plans, raw data tables, instrumentation calibration certificates, photographs

**Monitoring Instrumentation (typical):**
- Survey monuments (precise leveling to measure vertical settlement)
- Settlement gauges or settlement plates
- Inclinometers (measure lateral ground movement)
- Piezometers (measure groundwater levels if applicable)
- Automated monitoring systems (real-time data collection and alerts)

**Reporting Frequency:**
- **Daily reports during active trenchless installation** (brief summary of daily measurements, flag threshold exceedances)
- **Weekly comprehensive reports during active installation** (detailed analysis, trends, cumulative settlement)
- **Monthly/quarterly reports during post-installation monitoring** (verify settlement has stabilized)
- **Final report at end of monitoring period** (comprehensive summary, final assessment, lessons learned)

### 2. Condition Monitoring Reports

**Purpose:** Document condition of existing infrastructure (rail tracks, road pavement, buildings) before, during, and after trenchless crossing installation.

**Typical Content:**
1. **Executive Summary:** Key findings, condition changes, damage or distress observed, recommendations
2. **Introduction:** Project description, infrastructure type, monitoring objectives
3. **Pre-Installation Condition Assessment:** Baseline condition survey (photographs, condition ratings, existing defects documented)
4. **Monitoring During Installation:** Visual inspections, crack monitoring, track geometry surveys (for rail), pavement condition surveys (for roads)
5. **Post-Installation Condition Assessment:** Final condition survey, comparison to baseline, identification of any new damage or distress
6. **Damage Assessment:** If damage observed, document extent, likely cause (trenchless installation or pre-existing), responsibility determination
7. **Recommendations:** Repair requirements, ongoing monitoring, modifications to trenchless installation procedures
8. **Appendices:** Inspection checklists, photographs (before/during/after), condition rating forms, infrastructure owner correspondence

**Infrastructure-Specific Monitoring:**
- **Rail tracks:** Track geometry surveys (alignment, elevation, cross-level, gauge), visual inspection of ties, ballast, rail wear
- **Roads:** Pavement condition survey (cracking, rutting, potholes), ride quality
- **Buildings:** Crack monitoring, structural surveys
- **Utilities:** Pipeline integrity surveys (if crossing near existing utilities)

**Inspection Frequency:**
- **Pre-installation:** Comprehensive baseline survey
- **During installation:** Daily visual inspections; weekly detailed inspections
- **Post-installation:** Inspection immediately after completion; follow-up inspections at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months (or per infrastructure owner requirements)

**Data Sources:**
- Geotechnical monitoring instrumentation (survey monuments, settlement gauges, inclinometers)
- Visual inspections (photographs, inspection checklists, condition ratings)
- Infrastructure owner records (track geometry data, pavement condition data)
- Trenchless installation records (drilling fluid pressures, volumes, advancement rates)
- Coordination correspondence with infrastructure owners

**Preparation Method:**
- **TBD** — Monitoring reports prepared by geotechnical engineer or monitoring specialist (D&B Contractor in-house or specialist subcontractor)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Reports prepared per geotechnical engineering standards and infrastructure owner requirements

**Distribution:**
- Infrastructure owners (rail operators, road authorities) — required for approval and coordination
- D&B Contractor project management and engineering
- Employer (DP World Fraser Surrey Inc.)

- Regulatory authorities (if required for permits)
- **TBD** — Distribution per project coordination plan and infrastructure owner requirements

**Archival:**
