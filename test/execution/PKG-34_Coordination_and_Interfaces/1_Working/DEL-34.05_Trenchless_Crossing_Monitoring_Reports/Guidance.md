# Guidance: DEL-34.05 Trenchless Crossing Monitoring Reports

## Purpose

Supports development of **Trenchless Crossing Monitoring Reports** for **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Context:** Trenchless utility crossings under rail lines, roads, or other infrastructure minimize disruption to operations but create risk of settlement or damage. Monitoring verifies settlement is within acceptable limits and existing infrastructure is not damaged. Supports OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity by protecting infrastructure operations.

**Deliverable classification:** Report / Project Delivery / D&B Contractor

## Principles

### P1: Infrastructure Protection is Paramount
Rail lines, roads, and other infrastructure must remain operational during and after trenchless crossing installation. Excessive settlement or damage causes operational disruptions, safety risks, and liability. Monitoring provides early warning to prevent unacceptable impacts.

### P2: Baseline Data is Essential
Accurate baseline measurements (settlement and infrastructure condition) before trenchless installation are critical for detecting installation-induced changes. Without baseline, impossible to distinguish installation impacts from pre-existing conditions.

### P3: Real-Time Monitoring Enables Proactive Response
Daily monitoring during active trenchless installation allows immediate detection of threshold exceedances and proactive corrective action (adjust drilling fluid pressures, modify installation procedures, suspend installation if needed). Post-event investigation is too late to prevent damage.

### P4: Professional Engineering Judgment Required
Monitoring data interpretation requires geotechnical engineering expertise. Settlement trends, soil behavior, and threshold assessment are complex — rely on qualified geotechnical engineer for analysis and recommendations.

**Standards:** Geotechnical standards (ASTM, ISO); Railway standards (AREMA, Transport Canada); Road standards (TAC, provincial); ISO 9001, ISO 14001

## Considerations

### C1: Monitoring Point Locations
- Settlement monuments: Along crossing alignment (above trenchless bore) and perpendicular transects (to detect settlement extent); spacing based on geotechnical design (typically 5-10m intervals near crossing, wider spacing farther away)
- Condition inspection points: Critical infrastructure elements (rail joints, switches, bridge abutments, pavement joints, building corners)
- Accessibility: Ensure monitoring points are accessible for frequent measurements (avoid inaccessible locations)

### C2: Alert and Action Thresholds
- Define alert thresholds conservatively (e.g., 50-75% of design settlement limit) to provide early warning
- Action thresholds at design limits (settlement/movement that could affect infrastructure performance or safety)
- Infrastructure-specific thresholds: Rail tracks may have stricter limits than roads or open ground
- Coordinate thresholds with infrastructure owners and geotechnical engineer

### C3: Trenchless Method Considerations
- **Horizontal directional drilling (HDD):** Settlement risk from drilling fluid loss (high pressure fluid escapes into soil, causes heave or settlement); monitor drilling fluid pressures and volumes
- **Pipe jacking / microtunneling:** Settlement from ground loss at tunnel face or annulus grouting; monitor face pressures and grouting volumes
- **Shallow crossings:** Higher settlement risk (less soil cover); require more intensive monitoring
- **Challenging soil conditions:** Soft clays, loose sands, high groundwater — higher settlement risk

### C4: Infrastructure Sensitivity
- **Rail tracks:** Very sensitive to settlement (track geometry tolerances are tight); continuous monitoring during installation; track geometry surveys
- **Roads:** Moderate sensitivity (pavement can tolerate some settlement); focus on serviceability and safety
- **Buildings:** High sensitivity if adjacent to crossing; crack monitoring and structural surveys
- **Utilities:** Risk of damage to existing utilities if crossing nearby; utility locates and protection

### C5: Monitoring Duration
- Pre-installation: Baseline established (multiple measurements to verify stability)
- Active installation: Daily monitoring; highest risk period
- Post-installation: Settlement may continue after installation (consolidation, ground relaxation); monitor until settlement stabilizes (typically 6-12 months for clayey soils, shorter for sandy soils)
- Infrastructure owner may specify minimum post-installation monitoring duration

### C6: Data Management and Quality
- Automated data collection systems reduce manual effort and enable real-time alerts
- Data backup and version control critical (loss of monitoring data catastrophic)
- Regular data quality checks (detect instrument malfunction, measurement errors, data entry errors)
- Chain of custody for data (who collected, when, how)

## Trade-offs

### T1: Monitoring Intensity vs. Cost
- Intensive monitoring (many points, frequent measurements, automated systems) provides comprehensive data but high cost
- Minimal monitoring reduces cost but may miss critical settlement or damage
- Balance: Risk-based approach (intensive monitoring for high-risk crossings, moderate for low-risk); focus monitoring on critical infrastructure elements

### T2: Real-Time Monitoring vs. Manual Surveys
- Real-time automated systems (electronic inclinometers, automated total stations) provide continuous data and instant alerts but high equipment cost and technical complexity
- Manual surveys (conventional leveling, visual inspections) are flexible and lower cost but require personnel and have time lag
- Balance: Real-time for high-risk critical crossings; manual surveys for lower-risk crossings or post-installation monitoring

### T3: Alert Threshold Conservatism vs. Construction Efficiency
- Conservative alert thresholds (low values) provide early warning but may trigger frequent alerts and installation delays
- Relaxed thresholds reduce false alarms but may not provide adequate warning before action thresholds exceeded
- Balance: Set alert thresholds based on geotechnical assessment of settlement rate and consequences; adjust based on actual performance
