# Procedure: DEL-34.02 Interface Agreements

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for developing, negotiating, approving, executing, and implementing **Interface Agreements** within **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Deliverable purpose:** Provides project management/control documentation for formal interface agreements required by Employer's Requirements (ERs) (per Decomposition line 750, `_CONTEXT.md`).

**Objective alignment:** Supports OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" — The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities (Decomposition lines 63, 784). Interface agreements formalize coordination protocols and responsibilities.

**Deliverable type:** Document
**Responsible party:** D&B Contractor

## Steps

### Step 1: Interface Identification and Scoping (Early detailed design phase)

**1.1 Identify Interface Parties**
- Review Employer's Requirements for mandated interface parties and agreement scope — **TBD** — **location TBD**
- Review project scope, design drawings, and site constraints to identify additional interface parties:
  - **Utilities:** Metro Vancouver, BC Hydro, FortisBC, Telus, others
  - **Adjacent tenants/projects:** FSPL-TI, other Terminal tenants
  - **Regulatory authorities:** Transport Canada, CBSA, City of Surrey (if interface agreements required)
  - **Service providers:** Security, waste management, others (if formal agreements required)
- Confirm interface party legal names and contact information
- **Verification:** Interface party list reviewed and approved by Employer

**1.2 Define Scope of Each Interface**
- For each interface party, define the physical, operational, and information interface:
  - **Physical interface:** Property boundaries, utility connection points, shared infrastructure, access routes
  - **Operational interface:** Work windows, access restrictions, operational constraints, safety zones
  - **Information interface:** Communication protocols, document exchange, reporting requirements
- Prepare interface coordination drawings showing interface boundaries and connection points
- Identify key interface risks and coordination requirements
- **Verification:** Interface scope definition reviewed by discipline engineers; interface drawings prepared

**1.3 Prioritize Interface Agreements**
- Prioritize interface agreements based on criticality and schedule:
  - **Critical path interfaces:** Agreements required early in project (e.g., utility connections needed for site mobilization)
  - **High-risk interfaces:** Agreements with significant liability or operational impact
  - **Lower-priority interfaces:** Agreements that can be developed later (e.g., handover interfaces)
- Develop interface agreement development schedule aligned with project master schedule
- **Verification:** Prioritization and schedule reviewed by project management and Employer

### Step 2: Agreement Development (Detailed design phase, 3-6 months before interface work)

**2.1 Prepare Draft Agreement**

- **Required sections (per Specification FR-2):**
  1. Preamble/Recitals — Parties (full legal names), project background, purpose
  2. Definitions — Key terms (e.g., "the Works," "Interface Area"), reference documents
  3. Scope of Interface — Physical, operational, and information interfaces (reference interface coordination drawings)
  4. Roles and Responsibilities — D&B Contractor, interface party, joint responsibilities
  5. Coordination Protocols — Meeting schedules, communication methods, escalation paths, emergency contacts
  6. Technical Requirements — Design standards, submittal and approval requirements, construction sequencing, testing and commissioning, as-built documentation
