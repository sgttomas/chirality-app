# Specification: DEL-34.02 Interface Agreements

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for **Interface Agreements** within **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Purpose:** Provides project management/control documentation for interface agreements required by the Employer's Requirements (ERs) (per Decomposition line 750, `_CONTEXT.md`).

**Objective alignment:** Supports OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" — The Works minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities (Decomposition lines 63, 784). Interface agreements formalize coordination protocols and responsibilities to manage interfaces effectively and minimize disruption.

**Anticipated deliverable artifacts:**
- Interface agreements (FSPL-TI, Metro Vancouver, utilities)

**Package scope context:** Terminal operations interface, adjacent project coordination, utility coordination, marine coordination (Decomposition line 743).

**Inclusions:**
- Formal interface agreements with external parties as required by Employer's Requirements
- Agreement development, negotiation, approval, and execution
- Agreement implementation and change management
- Supporting documentation (interface drawings, schedules, contact lists)

**Exclusions:**
- Internal coordination protocols (covered by DEL-34.01 Coordination Meeting Records)
- Informal coordination arrangements not requiring formal agreements
- Regulatory permits and approvals (covered by respective discipline packages)
- Marine-specific coordination (see DEL-34.03 for marine coordination records)
