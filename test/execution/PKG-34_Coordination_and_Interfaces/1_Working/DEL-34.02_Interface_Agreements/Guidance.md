# Guidance: DEL-34.02 Interface Agreements

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Interface Agreements** for **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Deliverable purpose:** Provides project management/control documentation for formal interface agreements required by Employer's Requirements (ERs) (per Decomposition line 750, `_CONTEXT.md`).

**Project context:** The Works are being constructed at Fraser Surrey Terminal, an active commercial transload facility. Successful project delivery requires formal interface agreements with external parties (adjacent tenants/projects, utility providers, regulatory authorities) to establish clear coordination protocols, define responsibilities, and manage liabilities. These agreements support OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" by ensuring interfaces are managed effectively to minimize disruption (Decomposition lines 63, 784).

**Deliverable classification:**
- **Type:** Document
- **Discipline:** Project Delivery
- **Responsible:** D&B Contractor

## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Project Delivery discipline):**

### P1: Formal Agreements Clarify Roles and Reduce Risk

Formal interface agreements establish clear, documented expectations between parties, reducing misunderstandings and disputes. In a complex multi-party project environment (D&B Contractor, Employer, Terminal Operations, utilities, adjacent tenants, regulators), informal coordination arrangements are insufficient to manage technical, schedule, liability, and safety risks at interfaces.

Interface agreements provide:
- **Clarity:** Explicit assignment of responsibilities (who does what, when, and how)
- **Accountability:** Documented commitments and performance expectations
- **Risk allocation:** Clear liability and indemnity provisions protecting all parties
- **Enforceability:** Formal agreements provide recourse if parties fail to meet obligations

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Interface management best practice; industry experience with multi-party construction projects; **TBD**: Employer's Requirements rationale — **location TBD**.

### P2: Early Engagement Prevents Interface Conflicts

Interface agreements should be developed early in the project lifecycle (detailed design phase) to:
- Identify interface requirements and constraints before design is finalized
- Allow adequate time for negotiation and legal review
- Prevent rework due to late discovery of interface party requirements
- Establish coordination protocols before construction mobilization

Late engagement with interface parties often results in schedule delays, design changes, and increased costs.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Construction project management best practice (critical path planning, interface management); Specification PR-1 (timeliness requirement).

### P3: Stakeholder Alignment Supports Project Success

Interface agreements are not adversarial contracts — they are collaborative tools to align stakeholders toward mutual success. Effective agreements:
- Recognize mutual interests (e.g., safe work, minimal disruption, regulatory compliance)
- Build trust through transparent communication and fair risk allocation
- Establish escalation paths for issues (collaborative problem-solving before legal remedies)
- Support project objectives (OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity) by coordinating all parties effectively

**Source:** OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity (Decomposition line 63); **ASSUMPTION**: Stakeholder engagement principles per ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and project management best practice.

### P4: Legal Protection Requires Professional Review

Interface agreements include significant legal content (liabilities, indemnities, insurance requirements) that can expose the D&B Contractor and Employer to financial and legal risk if drafted poorly. Professional legal review is essential to:
- Ensure compliance with applicable laws (BC Contract Law, municipal/provincial regulations)
- Align with project contract (D&B Contract with Employer)
- Protect D&B Contractor and Employer interests
- Avoid unintended obligations or unenforceable terms

**Source:** Specification QR-1 (Legal Review requirement); **ASSUMPTION**: Standard practice for agreements with liability and indemnity provisions.

**Applicable standards context:**
- **ISO 9001** — Quality Management Systems: Emphasizes stakeholder communication, contract review, and documented agreements
- **ISO 14001** — Environmental Management Systems: Requires stakeholder engagement and environmental coordination at interfaces
- **ISO 45001** — Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems: Mandates safety coordination with external parties and joint safety protocols

## Considerations

**Factors to consider during interface agreement development:**

### C1: Interface Party Identification and Authority

- **Identify all relevant interface parties:** Review project scope, design drawings, site constraints, and Employer's Requirements to identify all external parties requiring formal agreements (utilities, adjacent tenants, regulators, service providers)
- **Verify party authority:** Confirm authorized representatives and signature authority for each interface party (corporate officer, operations manager, legal counsel?)
- **Understand party interests and constraints:** Each interface party has unique interests (operational continuity, regulatory compliance, cost recovery, liability protection) — understand these to negotiate effectively
- **Source:** Specification FR-1 (Interface Party Identification); Datasheet Attributes; **TBD**: Employer's Requirements for mandated interface parties — **location TBD**

### C2: Scope of Interface Definition

- **Define physical interfaces clearly:** Use interface coordination drawings to show property boundaries, utility connection points, shared infrastructure, access routes
- **Define operational interfaces:** Work windows, access restrictions, operational constraints (e.g., "no heavy equipment within 10m of active loading arm during vessel operations")
- **Define information interfaces:** Document exchange protocols, reporting requirements, communication methods
- **Avoid scope creep:** Be specific about what is included and excluded in the agreement; overly broad agreements create unintended obligations
- **Source:** Specification FR-3 (Scope of Interface Definition); **ASSUMPTION**: Interface management best practice

### C3: Coordination Protocol Design

- **Balance formality with flexibility:** Formal coordination protocols (monthly meetings, written notifications) provide structure, but allow flexibility for urgent issues or ad-hoc coordination
- **Integrate with project coordination:** Interface coordination should align with overall project coordination meetings (DEL-34.01) to avoid duplication and ensure consistency
- **Define decision-making authority:** Clarify who has authority to make decisions on specific interface topics (design changes, schedule adjustments, safety protocols)
- **Establish escalation paths:** Define clear escalation for unresolved issues (project manager → senior management → Employer → legal/dispute resolution)
- **Source:** Specification FR-4 (Coordination Protocols); relation to DEL-34.01; **ASSUMPTION**: Coordination protocol design best practice

### C4: Technical Requirements and Standards

- **Interface party standards:** Utility providers (Metro Vancouver, BC Hydro, FortisBC) have their own design standards, connection requirements, and approval processes — these must be incorporated into the agreement
- **Design submittal and approval:** Define submittal requirements (drawings, calculations, specifications) and approval timelines; late or incomplete submittals delay construction
- **Testing and commissioning:** Define inspection, testing, and commissioning requirements at interface (e.g., utility connection testing, witnessing by utility representative)
- **As-built documentation:** Define as-built documentation requirements (format, content, delivery timeline)
- **Source:** Specification FR-5 (Technical Requirements); **ASSUMPTION**: Utility coordination and design approval requirements

### C5: Liability, Indemnity, and Insurance

- **Understand liability exposure:** Interface work carries risks (damage to existing infrastructure, third-party injury, service disruption) — clearly allocate liability to appropriate parties
- **Negotiate fair risk allocation:** Liability should generally align with control (party with control over work assumes associated risk)
- **Indemnification clauses:** "Hold harmless" provisions protect one party from claims arising from another party's actions — these must be carefully drafted and reviewed by legal counsel
- **Insurance requirements:** Interface parties may require specific insurance coverage (types and limits) — verify coverage is available and cost-effective
- **Source:** Specification FR-6 (Liabilities and Indemnities); Specification QR-1 (Legal Review); **ASSUMPTION**: Construction contract risk allocation principles; **TBD**: Legal counsel review

### C6: Health, Safety, and Environment

- **Joint safety protocols:** Work at interfaces (e.g., near active utility infrastructure, adjacent to operational areas) requires joint safety coordination (permits, signage, barriers, communication)
- **Incident reporting:** Define incident reporting and investigation procedures for incidents at interface areas (who reports, to whom, within what timeframe)
- **Emergency response:** Define emergency response procedures (evacuation, first aid, fire, spill response) and contact information
- **Environmental protection:** Define environmental protection measures at interfaces (spill response, erosion control, waste management)
- **Source:** Specification FR-7 (Health, Safety, and Environment); **ASSUMPTION**: ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 interface coordination requirements

### C7: Negotiation Strategy

- **Build collaborative relationships:** Interface agreements are long-term partnerships — approach negotiations collaboratively, not adversarially
- **Identify "must-haves" vs. "nice-to-haves":** Prioritize critical terms (scope, schedule, liability) and be willing to compromise on secondary terms
- **Allow adequate time for negotiation:** Complex agreements (e.g., with Metro Vancouver or BC Hydro) may require multiple rounds of review and revision — start early
- **Involve appropriate expertise:** Bring in technical specialists (discipline engineers, schedulers) and legal counsel as needed
- **Document negotiation process:** Keep records of negotiation meetings, correspondence, and agreed changes for traceability
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Negotiation best practice; Specification PR-1 (Timeliness)

### C8: Agreement Implementation and Monitoring

- **Communicate agreement to project team:** Ensure all relevant personnel understand agreement terms and obligations (project management, discipline leads, construction management, QA/QC)
- **Incorporate into work plans:** Agreement obligations (e.g., advance notice periods, submittal deadlines) must be incorporated into project work plans and schedules
- **Monitor compliance:** Track compliance with agreement terms through project coordination meetings (DEL-34.01) and raise non-conformances promptly
- **Review agreement effectiveness:** Periodically review whether agreement is achieving its purpose and identify improvements
- **Source:** Specification QR-3 (Stakeholder Communication) and QR-4 (Compliance Monitoring); **ASSUMPTION**: Contract management best practice

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

### T1: Agreement Detail vs. Negotiation Time

- **Detailed agreements:** Provide comprehensive guidance and minimize ambiguity, but require significant drafting and negotiation time
- **High-level agreements:** Faster to negotiate but may leave critical terms undefined, leading to disputes during implementation
- **Trade-off consideration:** Balance detail with practicality; focus detail on high-risk areas (liabilities, safety, technical requirements) and allow flexibility on lower-risk areas; use appendices for detailed technical content
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Contract drafting and negotiation best practice

### T2: Formal vs. Informal Coordination

- **Formal coordination (documented in agreement):** Provides accountability and traceability but can be slow and bureaucratic
- **Informal coordination (ad-hoc discussions, emails):** Faster and more flexible but lacks accountability and documentation
- **Trade-off consideration:** Formal coordination for critical decisions (design approvals, schedule changes, safety protocols); informal coordination for day-to-day issues (routine communication, information exchange); ensure informal coordination is documented in meeting minutes (DEL-34.01)
- **Source:** Relation to DEL-34.01; **ASSUMPTION**: Coordination protocol design best practice

### T3: Risk Transfer vs. Relationship Management

- **Maximum risk transfer to interface party:** Protects D&B Contractor and Employer but may alienate interface party and damage relationship
- **Shared risk allocation:** Builds trust and collaboration but exposes D&B Contractor and Employer to liability
- **Trade-off consideration:** Allocate risk fairly based on control (party controlling work assumes associated risk); avoid one-sided agreements that interface parties will resist or not honor; seek mutually beneficial terms that protect both parties
- **Source:** Specification FR-6 (Liabilities and Indemnities); **ASSUMPTION**: Contract risk allocation principles

### T4: Standard Template vs. Customized Agreement

- **Standard template (uniform for all interface parties):** Efficient and consistent but may not fit unique circumstances of each interface
- **Customized agreement (tailored for each interface party):** Fits specific interface needs but requires more drafting and negotiation effort
- **Trade-off consideration:** Use standard template as starting point; customize key sections (scope, technical requirements, schedule) per interface party; maintain consistency on boilerplate sections (liability, insurance, change management)
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Contract drafting efficiency best practice

### T5: Early Agreement vs. Complete Information

- **Early agreement (during preliminary design):** Allows interface parties to influence design but agreement may require amendments as design develops
- **Late agreement (after design complete):** Agreement is more complete and accurate but design may not accommodate interface party requirements, causing rework
- **Trade-off consideration:** Develop high-level agreements early (during preliminary design) to establish coordination framework; finalize detailed terms (technical requirements, schedule) during detailed design; use change management provisions (Specification FR-2 section 10) to accommodate design evolution
- **Source:** Specification PR-1 (Timeliness); P2 (Early Engagement); **ASSUMPTION**: Design and interface management sequencing
