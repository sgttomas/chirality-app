## Conditions

**Project / Interface Context:**

This deliverable provides formal interface agreements required by Employer's Requirements to manage coordination, responsibilities, and liabilities with external parties at project interfaces.

**Interface Parties:**
1. **FSPL-TI** (Fraser Surrey Port Lands — likely Trans-Island or adjacent tenant/project)
   - **Interface nature:** Adjacent project or tenant within Terminal property
   - **Coordination needs:** Construction phasing, access, shared infrastructure, operational interfaces
   - **TBD** — Specific interface scope and party details

2. **Metro Vancouver**
   - **Interface nature:** Regional utility provider (water supply, wastewater, drainage, possibly solid waste)
   - **Coordination needs:** Utility connections, service agreements, design standards, approvals
   - **TBD** — Specific utility services and connection points

3. **Utilities** (multiple parties anticipated)
   - **BC Hydro:** Electrical power supply and distribution
   - **FortisBC:** Natural gas supply (if applicable)
   - **Telus / Shaw / other telecom:** Telecommunications and data services
   - **TBD** — Other utilities as identified during design development

**Source:** Decomposition line 750 (anticipated artifacts); PKG-34 scope (line 743); **ASSUMPTION**: Typical utility and interface parties for industrial facility construction in BC.

**Project Location Context:**
- **Location:** Fraser Surrey Terminal, 11060 Elevator Road, Surrey, BC
- **Facility type:** Active commercial transload terminal — construction concurrent with operations
- **Objective alignment:** OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" — minimize disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities (Decomposition line 63)
- **Jurisdictional context:** City of Surrey (municipal approvals), Metro Vancouver (regional utilities), Transport Canada (marine/port authority), CBSA (security/border)

**Agreement Timing:**
- **TBD** — Interface agreements typically required early in project (prior to construction mobilization or as prerequisite for specific work phases)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Agreements negotiated and executed during detailed design phase; updated as needed during construction

**Agreement Duration:**
- **TBD** — Agreements typically remain in force for project duration; some provisions may extend into operations/warranty phase
- **ASSUMPTION**: Review expiry and renewal provisions per agreement terms

## Construction

**Materials / Configuration:**

Anticipated artifacts (per Decomposition line 750, `_CONTEXT.md`):
- **Interface agreements (FSPL-TI, Metro Vancouver, utilities)**

**Typical Agreement Structure:**

1. **Preamble / Recitals**
   - Parties to the agreement
   - Project background and context
   - Purpose and intent of agreement

2. **Definitions**
   - Key terms (e.g., "the Works," "interface," "coordination protocol")
   - Reference documents (design drawings, specifications, schedules)

3. **Scope of Interface**
   - Physical interface boundaries (property lines, utility connection points, shared infrastructure)
   - Operational interface (access, scheduling, safety protocols)
   - Information interface (communication protocols, document exchange)

4. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - D&B Contractor responsibilities (design, construction, coordination)
   - Interface party responsibilities (access, approvals, utility services, coordination)
   - Joint responsibilities (safety coordination, incident response, interface monitoring)

5. **Coordination Protocols**
   - Meeting schedules and attendance
   - Communication methods and escalation paths
   - Decision-making authority and dispute resolution
   - Emergency contact information

6. **Technical Requirements**
   - Design standards and codes (interface party standards)
   - Approvals and acceptance criteria
   - Construction sequencing and phasing
   - Testing and commissioning requirements

7. **Schedule and Milestones**
   - Key interface milestones (design submittals, approvals, construction windows)
   - Coordination constraints and critical path items
   - Notification requirements (advance notice for work affecting interface party)

8. **Liabilities and Indemnities**
   - Liability allocation (damage to existing infrastructure, third-party claims)
   - Insurance requirements (coverage types and limits)
   - Indemnification clauses (hold harmless provisions)
   - **TBD** — Legal review and negotiation required

9. **Health, Safety, and Environment**
   - Safety protocols at interface areas
   - Environmental protection measures
   - Incident reporting and investigation
   - Emergency response procedures

10. **Change Management**
    - Process for changes to agreement terms
    - Amendment and revision procedures
    - Notice requirements

11. **Signatures and Execution**
    - Authorized signatories from each party
    - Execution date and effective date
    - Witness or notary (if required)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Typical interface agreement structure based on industry practice; **TBD**: Employer's Requirements for specific content and format requirements — **location TBD**.

**Document Format:**
- **TBD** — Likely formal agreement format (multi-party contract style) with letterhead and signatures
- **ASSUMPTION**: Prepared by D&B Contractor (with legal counsel review); negotiated and agreed with interface parties; submitted to Employer for approval/endorsement

**Supporting Documentation:**
- Interface coordination drawings (showing interface boundaries and connection points)
- Interface schedules (key milestones and coordination windows)
- Technical specifications for interface connections
- Contact lists and organization charts
- Previous correspondence and meeting minutes related to interface
