# Guidance: DEL-34.01 Coordination Meeting Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Coordination Meeting Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces**.

**Deliverable purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for weekly Terminal coordination meetings (per Decomposition line 749, `_CONTEXT.md`).

**Project context:** Fraser Surrey Terminal is an active commercial transload facility. The Works must be constructed while the Terminal continues commercial operations. Weekly coordination meetings are essential to achieving OBJ-5 "Terminal Continuity" — minimizing disturbance to existing Terminal commercial activities (Decomposition lines 63, 784).

**Deliverable classification:**
- **Type:** Record
- **Discipline:** Project Delivery
- **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Project Delivery discipline):**

### P1: Proactive Coordination Reduces Disruption

Construction at an active terminal requires proactive coordination to prevent conflicts between construction activities and commercial operations. Weekly meetings establish a predictable forum for:
- Advance notification of planned work activities
- Resolution of scheduling conflicts before they impact operations
- Escalation of emerging issues
- Continuous improvement of coordination practices

**Source:** OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity objective (Decomposition line 63); **ASSUMPTION**: Industry best practice for construction in operational environments.

### P2: Stakeholder Engagement Supports Project Success

Effective stakeholder engagement through regular coordination meetings:
- Builds trust and transparency with Terminal operations
- Ensures operational constraints are understood and accommodated
- Provides visibility into construction progress and upcoming activities
- Creates accountability through documented action items and commitments

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Project management best practice per ISO 9001 and stakeholder engagement principles; **TBD**: Confirm per project stakeholder engagement plan (if applicable).

### P3: Documentation Provides Traceability and Evidence

Comprehensive meeting minutes provide:
- Evidence of coordination efforts and due diligence
- Historical record for resolving disputes or misunderstandings
- Basis for tracking action items and commitments
- Input for project reporting and progress tracking
- Auditability for quality management system compliance

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: ISO 9001 quality documentation requirements; **TBD**: Specific traceability requirements per Employer's Requirements — **location TBD**.

### P4: Structured Process Ensures Consistency

A consistent meeting structure (agenda, minutes format, action tracking) ensures:
- All critical coordination topics are addressed
- Meetings remain focused and efficient
- Action items are not overlooked
- New attendees can quickly understand meeting purpose and protocols
- Quality of minutes is maintained across different preparers

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Meeting management best practice; **TBD**: Project-specific meeting protocols per project execution plan.

**Applicable standards context:**
- **ISO 9001** — Quality Management Systems: Emphasizes process consistency, documentation control, and continual improvement
- **ISO 14001** — Environmental Management Systems: Requires stakeholder engagement and communication protocols
- **ISO 45001** — Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems: Mandates worker consultation and coordination on safety matters

## Considerations

**Factors to consider during meeting planning and execution:**

### C1: Terminal Operations Constraints

- **Operating schedule:** Understand Terminal vessel schedules, loading arm operations, and peak activity periods
- **Access restrictions:** Coordinate construction access to avoid disrupting operational areas
- **Safety zones:** Respect operational safety boundaries and hot work permit areas
- **Utility outages:** Coordinate any utility shutdowns well in advance (power, water, communications)
- **Noise and vibration:** Schedule high-impact activities during Terminal low-activity periods
- **Source:** OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity (Decomposition line 63); PKG-34 scope (line 743)

### C2: Multi-Stakeholder Dynamics

- **Diverse interests:** Balance construction priorities, operational needs, regulatory requirements, and community concerns
- **Authority levels:** Ensure decision-makers attend meetings or provide clear delegation authority
- **Communication styles:** Adapt meeting format to accommodate technical and non-technical audiences
- **Confidentiality:** Respect commercial sensitivities related to Terminal operations
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Stakeholder management principles; **TBD**: Project stakeholder register and communication preferences

### C3: Coordination Scope Boundaries

This deliverable (DEL-34.01) covers general Terminal coordination. Related but distinct coordination workstreams include:
- **Marine coordination (DEL-34.03):** Marine-specific topics (notices to mariners, vessel scheduling, marine equipment)
- **Security compliance (DEL-34.04):** CBSA/TC security clearance and compliance matters
- **Utility coordination:** Coordination with Metro Vancouver and other utility providers (referenced in DEL-34.02 Interface Agreements)
- **Trenchless crossing monitoring (DEL-34.05):** Specialized monitoring for trenchless utility crossings

Ensure appropriate escalation pathways when coordination topics exceed the scope of general Terminal coordination meetings.

**Source:** PKG-34 deliverable structure (Decomposition lines 749-753).

### C4: Regulatory and Contractual Requirements

- **Permit conditions:** Some permits may require coordination meeting records as evidence of compliance
- **Employer's Requirements:** Review for specific coordination and communication requirements
- **Quality Management Plan:** Meeting records contribute to demonstrating QMS compliance
- **Health & Safety Plan:** Coordination meetings are a venue for safety coordination and consultation
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Typical regulatory and contractual requirements; **TBD**: Specific requirements per Employer's Requirements — **location TBD**

### C5: Action Item Management

- **Clarity:** Ensure action items are specific, measurable, and clearly assigned
- **Realistic timelines:** Assign due dates that account for resource availability and dependencies
- **Tracking mechanism:** Maintain action item register and review status at each meeting
- **Escalation:** Define escalation protocol for overdue or blocked action items
- **Closure evidence:** Document evidence of action completion (photos, submittals, confirmations)
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Project management best practice; **TBD**: Project-specific action item management protocol

### C6: Meeting Efficiency

- **Preparation:** Distribute agenda in advance; request pre-reads or presentations ahead of meeting
- **Time management:** Start and end on time; allocate time per agenda item; park non-critical discussions
- **Decision-making:** Clarify who has authority to make decisions on specific topics
- **Follow-up:** Ensure minutes are issued promptly while discussions are still fresh
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Meeting management best practice

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

### T1: Meeting Frequency vs. Coordination Effectiveness

- **Weekly meetings (as specified):** More frequent coordination reduces risk of conflicts but increases time commitment for participants
- **Bi-weekly or monthly:** Reduces meeting burden but may miss critical coordination windows
- **Trade-off consideration:** Weekly frequency appears appropriate given active terminal environment and OBJ-5 Terminal Continuity priority; adjust if project phase or risk profile changes
- **Source:** Decomposition line 749 specifies "Weekly"; **ASSUMPTION**: Weekly cadence appropriate for construction phase; **TBD**: Confirm meeting frequency adjustment criteria (e.g., reduce frequency during low-activity phases)

### T2: Minutes Detail vs. Preparation Time

- **Detailed verbatim minutes:** Provide comprehensive record but require significant preparation time
- **Summary minutes:** Capture key decisions and action items efficiently but may miss nuances
- **Trade-off consideration:** Focus on decisions, action items, and commitments rather than verbatim discussion; balance detail with timeliness (Specification PR-1)
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Meeting documentation best practice

### T3: Attendance Breadth vs. Meeting Efficiency

- **Broad attendance:** Ensures all stakeholders are informed but can make meetings lengthy and unfocused
- **Core attendance:** Keeps meetings efficient but may require separate follow-up communications
- **Trade-off consideration:** Maintain core attendee group (D&B Contractor, Employer, Terminal Ops, key subcontractors) with optional attendance for others; use minutes distribution for broader awareness
- **Source:** Specification FR-2; **ASSUMPTION**: Meeting management best practice

### T4: Standardization vs. Flexibility

- **Standardized format:** Ensures consistency and quality but may not accommodate unique situations
- **Flexible format:** Allows adaptation to specific needs but can lead to inconsistent quality
- **Trade-off consideration:** Use standardized minutes template but allow flexibility for agenda content and special topics
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION**: Balance between ISO 9001 process consistency and project adaptability

### T5: Digital vs. Paper Records

- **Electronic records:** Searchable, easily distributed, space-efficient; requires document management system
- **Paper records:** Tangible, can be signed/witnessed in real-time; requires physical storage
- **Trade-off consideration:** Primary electronic records with optional paper copies for signature/witness; ensure electronic archival meets retention requirements
- **Source:** Datasheet Attributes (Archive Format — TBD); **ASSUMPTION**: Electronic records preferred per modern project practices
