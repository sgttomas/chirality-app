## Pricing Method

**Method Distribution (by base cost):**

| Method | Base Cost | % of Total |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| ALLOWANCE | $233,000 | 85% |
| PARAMETRIC | $40,700 | 15% |
| QUOTE | $0 | 0% |
| RATE_TABLE | $0 | 0% |

**Primary Basis:** Fallback typical model (no project-specific quotes or rate tables available)

**See:** Decision_Log.md (D-3208), Source_Index.md, Assumptions_Log.md (A-3201 through A-3213)

---

## Contingency Methodology

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by CBS bucket with allowance-heavy adjustment)

**Baseline Contingency Rates:**
- Engineering (E): 10% baseline + 10% allowance-heavy adjustment = **20%**
- Project Management (PM): 10% baseline + 5% allowance-heavy adjustment = **15%**
- Procurement (P): 10% baseline (parametric) = **10%**
- Materials (MAT): 15% baseline + 10% allowance-heavy adjustment = **25%**
- Construction Indirects (CI): 20% baseline + 10% allowance-heavy adjustment = **30%**
- Commissioning (COM): 25% baseline (parametric) = **25%**

**Allowance-Heavy Adjustment Rationale:**
- E bucket: 100% allowance ($135k/$135k) → +10% adjustment
- MAT bucket: 100% allowance ($25k/$25k) → +10% adjustment
- CI bucket: 100% allowance ($90k/$90k) → +10% adjustment
- PM bucket: 53% allowance ($8k/$15k) → +5% adjustment
- P, COM buckets: parametric → no adjustment

**Blended Contingency Rate:** 23% ($64k / $274k)

## Completeness Metrics

**Deliverable Coverage:** 8 of 8 deliverables (100%)
**Line Items:** 14 total

**Pricing Confidence:**
- HIGH confidence: 0% (no quotes, no project-specific rates)
- MED confidence: 15% (parametric indirects: P, PM component, COM)
- LOW confidence: 85% (allowances: engineering, consultant, fees, compliance monitoring)

**Quantity Extraction:**
- Deliverables with explicit quantities: 0% (0 of 8) — no resource plans, no permit counts, no condition counts
- Deliverables with qualitative scope: 100% (8 of 8) — scope descriptions only, no numerical quantities

**Key Gaps:**
1. No resource plan (engineering hours, PM hours, QA/QC hours by deliverable/permit type)
2. No permit list or permit responsibility matrix (Contractor vs Employer permits TBD)
3. No issued permits or permit conditions (VFPA PER, DFO, Transport Canada conditions TBD)
4. No permit fee schedules or consultant budgets
5. No rate tables (labor rates, consultant rates)

**See:** QA_Report.md, Assumptions_Log.md

## Recommendations

To improve estimate quality and reduce contingency:

1. **Develop resource plan:**
   - Estimate engineering hours per permit type (VFPA PER, DFO, TC, building, construction, environmental, fire)
   - Estimate PM hours for permit tracking and coordination
   - Estimate QA/QC hours for compliance monitoring by authority (VFPA, DFO, TC, building inspector)

2. **Clarify Employer's Requirements:**
   - Provide permit responsibility matrix (Contractor vs Employer permits)
   - Provide required permit list
   - Provide permit submission schedule and approval timeline requirements

3. **Engage consultants and authorities:**
   - Engage regulatory/environmental consultants for preliminary scope and budget estimate
   - Obtain permit fee schedules from applicable authorities (VFPA, DFO, Transport Canada, City of Surrey, fire authority)

4. **Obtain issued permits:**
   - Once permits are issued, extract permit conditions and develop compliance monitoring plans

5. **Populate rate tables:**
   - Add labor rates (engineering, PM, QA/QC) to `_Estimates/_RateTables/`
   - Add consultant/specialist hourly rates
