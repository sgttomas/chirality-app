## 4. Contingency Summary

### 4.1 Contingency Method

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by CBS bucket with allowance-heavy adjustment)

**Baseline Rates:**
- Engineering, PM, Procurement: 10%
- Construction Directs/Indirects: 20%
- Commissioning: 25%

**Allowance Adjustment:**
- +5% if bucket allowance share ≥ 50%
- +10% if bucket allowance share ≥ 80%

**Applied Rates (PKG-33):**
- E: 20% (100% allowance → +10% adjustment)
- PM: 20% (88% allowance → +10% adjustment)
- P: 15% (0% allowance → baseline 10% + typical procurement margin)
- CI: 25% (69% allowance → +5% adjustment)
- COM: 25% (100% allowance → +10% adjustment, capped at 25% for commissioning baseline)

### 4.2 Contingency by CBS

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Allowance Share | Contingency Rate | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| E | $545,000 | 100% | 20% | $109,000 |

| **Total** | **$775,000** | **96%** | **24.4% blended** | **$189,250** |

**Rounded Contingency:** $189,000 CAD (per rounding policy D-007)

---

### 4.3 Contingency Rationale

**Primary Risk Drivers:**
1. HSE regulatory requirements uncertainty (VFPA, WorkSafeBC, Metro Vancouver)
2. Environmental monitoring scope not fully defined (CEMP, SPPP)
3. Construction and commissioning duration assumptions (24 mo + 3 mo)
4. Method statement and risk assessment volume uncertainty

**Contingency Adequacy:**
- **Adequate** for normal scope/quantity variance within ±30%
- **Marginal** for significant regulatory requirement increases or monitoring scope expansions
- **Inadequate** for multi-year labor escalation (escalation should be separate provision)

**See Risk_Register.md for detailed risk analysis (8 risks identified).**

## 5. Exclusions

This estimate explicitly **excludes**:

1. **Owner's Costs:**
   - Employer's HSE staff or Owner's Engineer HSE oversight

   - Emergency response equipment (assumed in PKG-11 or similar marine packages)
   - Spill response equipment (assumed in PKG-11 or similar)

3. **Escalation:**
   - Cost growth over time not applied (January 2026 pricing basis)
   - Actual multi-year labor escalation exposure: $25k-$60k (see R-007)

4. **Taxes:**
   - GST, PST, or other sales taxes not included

5. **Permits/Fees:**
   - Environmental permit application fees
   - VFPA regulatory fees

## 6. Key Assumptions

**Top Assumptions Driving Estimate (see Assumptions_Log.md for full list):**

1. **A-004:** CEMP compliance monitoring = $140k (range: $90k-$190k) — 18% of base
2. **A-001:** OHS Plan = $120k (range: $80k-$160k) — 15% of base
3. **A-003:** Method statements = $110k (range: $70k-$150k) — 14% of base
4. **A-002:** Risk assessments = $95k (range: $60k-$130k) — 12% of base
5. **A-009:** Construction duration = 24 months; commissioning = 3 months

**Combined Top 4 Allowances:** $465,000 (60% of base estimate)

**Validation Priority:** Obtain HSE/environmental consultant quotes and clarify regulatory requirements to validate top assumptions.

## 7. Estimate Maturity and Accuracy

**Estimate Class:** **Class 5 (Order of Magnitude / Conceptual)**

**Basis for Classification:**
- 96% allowance-based pricing (no vendor quotes or rate tables)
- Deliverable folders not yet scaffolded
- Regulatory requirements not confirmed
- Construction schedule not finalized

**Expected Accuracy Range:**
- **Low Estimate:** -30% ($677,000 CAD total)
- **Base Estimate:** $964,000 CAD
- **High Estimate:** +50% ($1,446,000 CAD total)

**Conservative Range:** $675,000 - $1,450,000 CAD

**Suitable For:**
- Conceptual budgeting and feasibility assessment
- Package-level cost comparison
- Order-of-magnitude project cost buildup

**NOT Suitable For:**
- Detailed project budgeting or cost baseline
- Contracting, procurement, or GMP development
- Financing or investment decisions

## 8. Comparison to Similar Packages

**Context:** PKG-33 is a cross-cutting HSE/environmental compliance package that supports all construction packages (PKG-00 through PKG-32).

**Comparable Estimates (from previous snapshots):**
- PKG-28 (Design Verification): $892k total — similar cross-cutting service package
- PKG-24 (Security Systems): $1,047k total — similar compliance/systems package
- PKG-25 (Communications & IT): $723k total — similar systems package

**PKG-33 Position:** $964k total — consistent with similar cross-cutting service/compliance packages in the $700k-$1M range.

**Reasonableness Check:** ✓ PASS (estimate aligns with similar package scales)

## 9. Recommended Next Steps

### 9.1 Before Using This Estimate for Budget Decisions

1. **Clarify regulatory requirements:**
   - Engage VFPA, WorkSafeBC, Metro Vancouver for HSE/environmental compliance requirements
   - Review Employer's Requirements Volumes 1-3 for HSE specifications
   - Confirm CEMP and SPPP monitoring scope

2. **Obtain vendor quotes:**
   - HSE consultant services (OHS Plan, risk assessments, method statements)
   - Environmental consultant services (CEMP/SPPP monitoring)
   - Emergency response planning services

3. **Add escalation provision:**
   - Estimate exposes $25k-$60k labor escalation over 2-3 years
   - Recommend explicit escalation provision separate from contingency

### 9.2 To Improve Estimate Maturity (Class 5 → Class 4)

4. **Scaffold deliverables and create specifications:**
   - Run PREPARATION agent to create PKG-33 deliverable folders
   - Run 4_DOCUMENTS agent to initialize Datasheet.md, Specification.md
   - Define HSE plan page counts, risk assessment templates, method statement requirements

5. **Develop project rate tables:**
   - HSE professional labor rates (manager, coordinator, specialist)
   - Environmental consultant rates
   - Waste disposal rates (if applicable)

6. **Finalize construction schedule:**
   - Confirm construction and commissioning durations
   - Enable time-based indirects model for environmental monitoring

7. **Re-run estimating agent** with improved inputs
