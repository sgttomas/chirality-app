## Key Assumptions Impact

| Assumption | Amount (CAD) | % of Base | Risk Level |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| A-009: Reinforcing steel (180 tonnes) | $540,000 | 25.9% | HIGH |
| A-006: Containment wall concrete/install | $354,000 | 17.0% | HIGH |
| A-005: Tank foundation concrete/install | $180,000 | 8.6% | MED |
| A-010: Wall formwork | $135,000 | 6.5% | MED |
| A-003: Design calculations | $120,000 | 5.8% | MED |
| A-007: Equipment pad concrete/install | $96,000 | 4.6% | MED |
| All other assumptions | $656,407 | 31.5% | LOW-MED |

**Highest Risk Assumption:** A-009 (Reinforcing steel) represents 25.9% of base estimate. Rebar quantities are parametrically derived and highly sensitive to actual reinforcement ratios.

## Comparison to Project Context

**Project Parameters (from decomposition):**
- Facility: Canola Oil Transload Facility (1M MT/yr throughput; 45,000 MT storage)
- Contract: Design & Build
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, Surrey, BC

**PKG-05 Scope Context:**
- Supports OBJ-3 (Storage Capacity 45,000 MT) — tank foundations
- Supports OBJ-7 (Environmental Protection) — containment walls with waterstops

**PKG-05 as % of Total Project:** TBD (full project estimate not yet prepared)

**Note:** Structural concrete for storage tanks and containment is typically 3-5% of total EPC project value for liquid terminal facilities. At $2.55M, this implies total project estimate range of $51M - $85M (rough order of magnitude check).
