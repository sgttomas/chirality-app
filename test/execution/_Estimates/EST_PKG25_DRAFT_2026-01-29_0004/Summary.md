## Key Risks and Opportunities

### Top Cost Risks

1. **Network architecture undefined** — Switch specifications, port counts, bandwidth requirements TBD (impacts MAT)
2. **Building layouts unavailable** — Telecommunications room locations, cable routing distances TBD (impacts MAT, CD)
3. **Technology selection unknowns** — Cat 6 vs Cat 6A; PoE requirements; fiber grades TBD (±20-40% MAT impact)
4. **Terminal operational constraints** — Security clearances, access restrictions, escort requirements (impacts CD, CI productivity)
5. **Integration with PKG-19 undefined** — Control system network interfaces and requirements TBD (impacts COM)

### Potential Opportunities

1. **Vendor quotes** — Competitive pricing for network equipment and structured cabling could reduce MAT by 10-20%
2. **Simplified network architecture** — Fewer switches/TRs than assumed could reduce MAT and CD by 15-25%
3. **Shared infrastructure** — Cable pathways provided by PKG-17/PKG-21 could reduce CD installation labor
4. **Standard equipment specifications** — Off-the-shelf equipment vs. customized specs could reduce procurement lead time and cost

## Next Steps

**To Improve Estimate Quality:**
1. Complete network architecture design (resolves equipment and cabling quantities)
2. Obtain building layouts and telecommunications room locations (coordinate with PKG-21, PKG-22)
3. Acquire vendor budgetary quotes for network equipment, cabling materials, installation labor
4. Define integration requirements with PKG-19 Control Systems
5. Develop project labor rate tables and productivity factors
6. Re-run estimate to upgrade from Class 5 to Class 4/3

**Validation Required:**
- Employer's Requirements for communications systems
- Network bandwidth and performance requirements
- Technology standards (TIA vs ISO/IEC)
- Site access and security clearance procedures
