### Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quantities | LOW | All assumed from parametric model; no P&IDs or line list |
| Pricing | LOW | All allowances; no pipe supplier quotes |
| Scope definition | LOW | Deliverables in INITIALIZED state; no stress analysis |
| Routing complexity | MEDIUM | Standard terminal layout assumed |
| Material selection | MEDIUM | Carbon steel typical for canola oil; confirm from DEL-14.02 |
| Interface coordination | LOW | Multiple package interfaces undefined |
| Transient analysis | LOW | Surge requirements unknown; DEL-14.06/07 not complete |
| **Overall** | **LOW** | Placeholder estimate only |

### Key Assumptions

1. Total process piping quantity of ~1,700 linear meters based on typical terminal layout
2. Carbon steel construction throughout (no exotic alloys for canola oil service)
3. Shop prefabrication with field assembly and welding
4. ASME B31.3 process piping code compliance
5. 100% RT on headers; spot RT on smaller lines
6. Insulation and heat tracing on all product lines for cold weather protection
7. 32 railcar unloading stations on 2 tracks feeding collection headers
8. 3 × 15,000 MT storage tanks with inlet/outlet manifolding
9. Single export line to marine loading interface (no redundancy)
10. Nitrogen distribution from Employer-furnished skid connection point
11. BC lower mainland productivity factors (1.0 baseline)
12. Phase 2 connection provisions per DEL-14.01 scope

### Exclusions

- Owner's costs
- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Nitrogen supply skid (Employer-furnished per DEC-07)
- Railcar unloading arms (PKG-10)
- Double-walled export pipe (PKG-11)
- Storage tanks and internals (PKG-13)
- Pumps and motors (PKG-15)
- Valves and actuators (PKG-16)
- Control systems (PKG-19)
- Field instrumentation (PKG-20)
- Escalation
- Taxes

### Interface Packages

| Package | Interface | Cost Impact |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| PKG-10 Railcar Unloading | Header flange connections at unloading stations | Flange/gasket at each station |
| PKG-11 Marine Loading | Single-wall to double-wall pipe transition | Flange connection at interface |
| PKG-13 Storage Tanks | Tank nozzle connections (inlet/outlet/recycle) | Flange connections |
| PKG-15 Pumps | Pump suction and discharge piping | Spool pieces to pump nozzles |
| PKG-16 Valves | Inline valve locations | Valve bodies in PKG-16; flanges in PKG-14 |
| PKG-19 Control Systems | Process connections for instruments | Orifice flanges, taps |
| PKG-20 Field Instrumentation | Instrument process connections | Thermowell, tap connections |
| PKG-05 Concrete Structures | Pipe support foundations | Support bases in PKG-05 |
| PKG-06 Structural Steelwork | Pipe rack steelwork | Rack framing may be in PKG-06 |

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Develop P&IDs and piping GAs (DEL-14.01) to confirm routing and quantities
2. **Priority:** Complete line list (DEL-14.04) with pipe sizes, materials, service conditions
3. **Priority:** Perform stress analysis (DEL-14.03) to confirm expansion provisions and support requirements
4. Complete transient studies (DEL-14.06, DEL-14.07) to identify surge protection needs
5. Coordinate with PKG-10 for header interface at railcar unloading stations
6. Coordinate with PKG-11 for export piping interface location
7. Coordinate with PKG-13 for tank nozzle schedule and elevations
8. Coordinate with PKG-15 for pump suction/discharge nozzle locations
9. Obtain budgetary quotes from pipe suppliers for large diameter material
10. Confirm insulation and heat trace requirements with process design
11. Progress deliverables from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS with defined scope
