## Estimate Basis and Confidence

### Pricing Method Breakdown

| Method | Line Items | Base Amount | % of Base |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| ALLOWANCE | 21 | $957,000 | 84.9% |
| PARAMETRIC | 4 | $170,336 | 15.1% |
| QUOTE | 0 | $0 | 0% |
| RATE_TABLE | 0 | $0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **25** | **$1,127,336** | **100%** |

### Confidence Assessment

| CBS Bucket | Confidence | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Engineering (E) | LOW | No ER extraction; scope and complexity assumptions only |
| Materials (MAT) | LOW | No design drawings or calculations; fixture counts/types estimated; no vendor pricing |
| Construction Directs (CD) | LOW | No design drawings; installation scope and productivity assumptions; no contractor pricing |
| Construction Indirects (CI) | MED | Factor-based (18% of CD) using fallback model; typical for electrical work |
| Project Management (PM) | MED | Factor-based (6% of directs+MAT) using fallback model; typical for EPCM |
| Procurement (P) | MED | Factor-based (2% of MAT) using fallback model; typical for equipment procurement |
| Commissioning (COM) | MED | Enhanced allowance for extensive testing scope; factor-based with adjustment |

**Overall Estimate Confidence:** LOW

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Fixture counts and types pending lighting design and illumination calculations
- Hazardous area classification extent unknown
- ER illumination requirements not extracted
- Control system integration complexity TBD
- Emergency lighting extent subject to final building egress design
- No vendor pricing for fixtures, poles, or controls

## Recommendations

### Next Steps to Improve Estimate

**Immediate (before 30% design):**
1. Extract ER lighting requirements (Vol 2 Parts 1-3)
2. Obtain hazardous area classification drawings
3. Coordinate with PKG-17 for electrical supply voltages and panel locations
4. Coordinate with PKG-19 for control system integration approach
5. Obtain building layouts from PKG-21/PKG-22 for interior lighting

**30% Design Milestones:**
1. Complete preliminary lighting layouts (DEL-18.01) with fixture schedules
2. Perform illumination calculations (DEL-18.03) to validate fixture counts
3. Obtain budgetary quotes from lighting vendors
4. Define control zoning and integration strategy

**60% Design Milestones:**
1. Finalize lighting design drawings and calculations
2. Obtain firm vendor quotes for fixtures and poles
3. Obtain electrical contractor pricing for installation
4. Update estimate to Class 3 (Budget) accuracy
