### Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quantities | LOW | Track lengths assumed from 32-car capacity |
| Pricing | LOW | All allowances; no vendor quotes |
| Scope definition | LOW | Deliverables in INITIALIZED state |
| Track design | LOW | No design drawings or calculations |
| **Overall** | **LOW** | Placeholder estimate only |

### Key Assumptions

1. New Tracks 6 & 7 each 500 linear meters (~32 railcar positions at 15m spacing)
2. Track 5 restoration of 300 linear meters (partial scope)
3. Ballast at 1.5 m³ per linear meter of track
4. Heavy rail (115 RE or equivalent) at $350/m installed
5. 4 end stops (2 per new track) at $15,000/unit installed
6. Track work coordinated with terminal operations (PKG-34)
7. Subgrade preparation in PKG-02 Earthworks scope
8. Track drainage in PKG-03 Utilities scope

### Exclusions

- Owner's costs
- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Track electrical bonding/grounding (assumed PKG-17)
- Track switches/turnouts (scope TBD)
- Subgrade preparation (PKG-02)
- Track drainage (PKG-03)
- Escalation
- Taxes

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Develop track layout design to confirm track lengths and alignment (DEL-07.01)
2. **Priority:** Complete track geometry calculations to confirm ballast requirements (DEL-07.03)
3. Obtain budgetary quotes for rail supply and installation
4. Confirm scope split with adjacent packages (PKG-02, PKG-03, PKG-17, PKG-34)
5. Progress deliverables from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS with defined scope
6. Clarify Track 5 restoration extent and condition
