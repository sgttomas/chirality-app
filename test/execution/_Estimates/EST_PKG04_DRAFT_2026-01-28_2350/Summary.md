### Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quantities | LOW | All assumed from parametric model (site area ratios) |
| Pricing | LOW | All allowances; no quotes |
| Scope definition | LOW | Deliverables in INITIALIZED state |
| Subgrade conditions | LOW | Dependent on PKG-02 earthworks completion |
| **Overall** | **LOW** | Placeholder estimate only |

### Key Assumptions

1. Total pavement area of approximately 45,000 m² (asphalt + concrete combined)
2. Asphalt paving area of ~35,000 m² for roadways, hardstand, and parking areas
3. Concrete paving area of ~10,000 m² for heavy load areas and chemical exposure zones
4. Curb and gutter length of ~2,500 linear meters
5. Sidewalk area of ~600 m² for personnel access routes
6. Line marking of ~6,000 linear meters for traffic control and parking
7. Pavement thickness: asphalt ~150mm total, concrete ~200mm
8. Base course thickness: ~200mm granular base under all paved areas
9. BC lower mainland productivity factors (1.0 baseline)
10. Subgrade preparation completed by PKG-02 Earthworks prior to PKG-04 work

### Exclusions

- Owner's costs
- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Off-site roadway improvements
- Escalation
- Taxes
- Subgrade preparation (PKG-02)
- Drainage infrastructure (PKG-03)
- Structure foundations (PKG-05)

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Complete pavement layout design (DEL-04.01) with area calculations for quantity takeoff
2. **Priority:** Coordinate with PKG-02 for geotechnical data and subgrade bearing capacity
3. Obtain traffic loading data from Owner for pavement design calculations (DEL-04.03)
4. Obtain budgetary quotes from paving contractors for asphalt and concrete work
5. Progress deliverables from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS with defined scope
6. Coordinate Phase 2 expansion corridor locations with Owner (OBJ-8)
