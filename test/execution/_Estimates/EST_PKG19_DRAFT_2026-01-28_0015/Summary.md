## Key Assumptions

1. Single-vendor integrated DCS/PLC solution (A-003)
2. I/O count estimated at 600-800 points based on facility scope (A-006)
3. Three control room HMI workstations (2 operator + 1 engineering) (A-004)
4. Three remote HMI panels at key process areas (A-005)
5. Control system installed in MCC building per PKG-21/22 (A-001)
6. Standard industrial control system complexity (A-013)
7. No Safety Instrumented System (SIS) included; BPCS only (A-014)
8. Historian with 400-600 process tags (A-008)

## Key Risks

| Risk ID | Risk | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| R-001 | Vendor selection impacts pricing (+/- 20%) | HIGH |
| R-002 | I/O count growth from detailed design | MEDIUM |
| R-003 | Software development scope expansion | MEDIUM |
| R-004 | SIS requirement added from HAZOP | HIGH |
| R-005 | Cybersecurity requirements increase scope | MEDIUM |

## Comparison to Benchmarks

| Metric | This Estimate | Industry Benchmark | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Control system cost per I/O point | $2,600-3,000/point | $2,000-4,000/point | Within typical range |
| Control system as % of process equipment | 3-5% | 2-6% | Typical for liquid terminal |
| HMI workstation unit cost | $25,000/station | $15,000-40,000 | Mid-range assumption |
| Engineering as % of MAT | 26% | 15-30% | Appropriate for D&B scope |

## Notes

- All pricing based on allowances (Class 5 estimate)
- Estimate excludes field instrumentation (PKG-20), which is a separate package
- Estimate excludes electrical power distribution (PKG-17), which is a separate package
- Control system commissioning support included; full system commissioning in PKG-30
