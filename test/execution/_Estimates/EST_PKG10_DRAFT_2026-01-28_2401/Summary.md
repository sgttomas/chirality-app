### Key Assumptions

1. 32 railcar unloading stations as specified in decomposition
2. Articulating bottom-loading unloading arms @ $50k/unit (typical range $45k-60k)
3. Dry-break quick-connect couplers @ $3k/unit integrated with arms
4. Gravity flow header: 400 lm of 8-12 inch piping @ $700/lm average
5. Individual spill containment pans (32 units) @ $8k/unit fabricated
6. 8 sump pumps for grouped containment zones
7. Local flow indicators at each station (32 units) @ $2.5k/unit
8. Atmospheric venting system for all 32 stations with flame arrestors
9. BC lower mainland productivity factors (1.0 baseline)
10. Installation labor rates @ $110/hr all-in for field work

### Exclusions

- Owner's costs
- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Rail track construction (PKG-07)
- Product transfer piping downstream of header (PKG-14)
- Storage tanks (PKG-13)
- Custody transfer metering (PKG-12)
- Control system integration (PKG-19)
- Field instrumentation beyond flow indicators (PKG-20)
- Electrical distribution to pumps (PKG-17)
- Nitrogen supply skid (Employer-supplied)
- Escalation
- Taxes

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Obtain budgetary quotes from unloading arm suppliers (32 units is substantial scope)
2. **Priority:** Coordinate with PKG-07 for rail track alignment and station positioning
3. **Priority:** Obtain product data sheets for canola oil (density, viscosity, temperature requirements)
4. Coordinate header discharge connection with PKG-14 process piping
5. Coordinate flow indicator specifications with PKG-20 instrumentation
6. Progress DEL-10.03 calculations to refine header sizing and simultaneous operations
7. Obtain regulatory requirements for containment volume to verify pan sizing
8. Consider value engineering: combined containment zones vs 32 individual pans
