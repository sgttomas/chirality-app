### Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quantities | LOW | All assumed from parametric model |
| Pricing | LOW | All allowances; no quotes |
| Scope definition | LOW | Deliverables in INITIALIZED state |
| Ground conditions | LOW | No geotechnical data |
| **Overall** | **LOW** | Placeholder estimate only |

### Key Assumptions

1. Site development area of approximately 5 hectares
2. Cut volume of ~15,000 m³; fill volume of ~25,000 m³
3. Ground improvement required over 3 hectares (30,000 m²)
4. Ground improvement via vibro-compaction/stone columns at ~$50/m²
5. Geotechnical investigation scope of 15-20 boreholes to 15-25m depth
6. BC lower mainland productivity factors (1.0 baseline)

### Exclusions

- Owner's costs
- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Contaminated soil handling/disposal
- Major utility relocations
- Surcharge preloading (if required)
- Escalation
- Taxes

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Complete geotechnical investigation to confirm ground improvement requirements
2. **Priority:** Complete topographic survey to establish baseline and enable quantity takeoff
3. Develop preliminary earthworks design with cut/fill quantities
4. Obtain budgetary quotes for drilling and ground improvement services
5. Progress deliverables from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS with defined scope
