## Estimate Basis & Methods

### Pricing Methods Used

| Method | % of Base | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| PARAMETRIC | 92% | Engineering drafting, technical writing, PM coordination (based on typical production rates) |
| ALLOWANCE | 8% | Printing/binding, document management software |
| QUOTE | 0% | No vendor quotes available at this stage |
| RATE_TABLE | 0% | No project-specific rate tables available |

### Key Assumptions

**A-001:** Total project drawings estimated at 275 sheets based on typical EPC facility of this scale and complexity.

**A-002:** Operational systems count estimated at 12 for operation manual development.

**A-003:** Major equipment count estimated at 90 items requiring maintenance manuals and vendor documentation.

**A-004:** Printing and binding allowance for large-format drawings: $3,850-$4,125 per set (record vs as-built quality).

**A-005:** Manual printing and binding allowance: $1,100 per operation manual set, $2,200 per maintenance manual set.

**A-006:** Document management software/database allowance: $22,000 for asset hierarchy in CMMS-ready format.

### Labor Rates Used

| Role | Rate (CAD/hr) | Source |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Engineering (blended) | $165 | Parametric (senior/intermediate drafting, technical writing) |
| Project Management | $132 | Parametric (document control, coordination) |

### Production Rates Used

| Activity | Rate | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Record drawing production | 12 hrs/sheet | D-006 (multi-discipline coordination average) |
| As-built incorporation | +8 hrs/sheet | D-006 (field markup review, updates, QA) |
| Operation manual development | 80 hrs/system | D-007 (system-level procedures and diagrams) |
| Maintenance manual compilation | 16 hrs/equipment | D-007 (from vendor docs + project additions) |

## Contingency Breakdown

Contingency applied using **PCT_BY_BUCKET** method per config.

| CBS Bucket | Base Amount | Baseline % | Allowance Adjustment | Total % | Contingency |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| Engineering (E) | $472,000 | 10% | 0% (no allowances) | 10% | $47,000 |
| Project Management (PM) | $224,000 | 10% | 0% (no allowances) | 10% | $22,000 |
| Materials (MAT) | $59,000 | 15% | +10% (100% allowance) | 25% | $15,000 |
| **Total** | **$755,000** | **-** | **-** | **11%** | **$84,000** |

**Rationale:** Higher contingency on MAT bucket due to 100% allowance-based pricing (no firm quotes for printing/binding/software). Engineering and PM buckets at baseline contingency as parametric methods are based on established production rates.

## Exclusions

The following are excluded from this estimate:
- Owner's internal review costs
- Owner's document management system (estimate includes contractor-provided asset database only)
- Translation services (estimate assumes English-language deliverables)
- Additional copies beyond quantities specified (3 drawing sets, 4 manual sets)
- Digital archiving beyond standard PDF/CAD file delivery
- Post-handover document updates during defects liability period

---

## Estimate Confidence & Maturity

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-LOW

**Maturity Indicators:**
- Deliverable folders: Not yet initialized (0% drafts available)
- Pricing sources: 0% from quotes, 0% from rate tables, 100% from parametric/allowance
- Quantities basis: Estimated drawing counts and equipment counts (not yet verified from design)

**Primary Risks to Estimate:**
1. Actual drawing count may vary significantly from 275-sheet estimate (±30% range likely)
2. Number of operational systems and equipment items not yet confirmed from design
3. VFPA drawing standards compliance may require additional effort if standards are more stringent than assumed
4. As-built markup complexity depends on field change volume during construction
5. Vendor documentation quality/completeness may require more compilation effort than assumed
6. Asset hierarchy database requirements not yet detailed by Employer

**Recommended Actions to Improve Estimate:**
1. Confirm total drawing count estimate once design progresses to 30% stage
2. Confirm equipment list and system breakdown from engineering deliverables (PKG-27)
3. Obtain VFPA drawing standards and template requirements
4. Clarify Employer's asset hierarchy/CMMS requirements and format
5. Obtain quotes for printing/binding services
6. Define final deliverable copy quantities and formats with Employer
