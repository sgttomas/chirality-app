## Key Risks

| ID | Risk | Potential Impact |
|----|------|------------------|
| R-001 | MCC building size larger than assumed | +$100,000 to +$300,000 |
| R-002 | Pile foundations required (difficult ground) | +$50,000 to +$100,000 |
| R-003 | Seismic design upgrades | +$30,000 to +$80,000 |
| R-004 | Marine corrosion protection upgrades | +$20,000 to +$50,000 |
| R-005 | Labor productivity in congested site | +$20,000 to +$40,000 |

See `Risk_Register.md` for complete analysis (R-001 through R-010).

## Recommendations

1. **Obtain MCC building size:** Coordinate with PKG-17 (Electrical) to define equipment layout and space requirements.

2. **Confirm operator shelter quantity:** Coordinate with PKG-10 (Railcar Unloading) to confirm shelter locations and count.

3. **Request budget quotes:** Obtain preliminary pricing from PEMB suppliers for more accurate material costs.

4. **Geotechnical input:** Confirm foundation type (piles vs spread footings) per geotechnical investigation.

5. **Hazardous area review:** Confirm building classification per facility HAZOP to identify any special requirements.
