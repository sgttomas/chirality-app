## Key Assumptions

1. MV/LV Transformers: 2 units, 1000-1500 kVA each, pad-mounted
2. MV Switchgear: 5-bay lineup, 5kV or 15kV class
3. LV Switchgear: Main-tie-main configuration, 480V or 600V
4. MCCs: 3 units distributed across facility (railcar area, tank farm, marine area)
5. Distribution Panels: 8 units for lighting/receptacles/small power
6. UPS: 10 kVA for control systems
7. Grounding: 1200m conductor, 15 electrodes
8. Cable lengths: MV 800m, LV 3500m, Control 2500m (approximate, no layout drawings)
9. No hazardous area classification requirements
10. Utility service available at site boundary
11. No escalation beyond January 2026 pricing

**All assumptions have LOW confidence pending design development and load calculations.**

---

## Key Risks

1. **Actual motor loads significantly exceed assumptions** (R-1701): +$150k to +$400k
2. **Hazardous area classification required** (R-1702): +$100k to +$250k
3. **Utility service voltage/configuration different** (R-1703): +$75k to +$200k
4. **Cable routing lengths significantly exceed estimates** (R-1704): +$100k to +$300k
5. **Poor soil resistivity requiring enhanced grounding** (R-1705): +$50k to +$150k
6. **Equipment delivery lead times and premium pricing** (R-1706): +$100k to +$300k
7. **ER requirements not extracted** (R-1707): +$50k to +$200k
8. **Integration complexity with control systems** (R-1708): +$75k to +$200k

**Total Risk Exposure:** +$700k to +$2,000k (cumulative, not probabilistic)

**Contingency Provision:** $896,000 (25%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions to Improve Estimate

1. **Extract ER requirements** (Vol 2 Parts 1-3) for electrical design criteria, standards, and redundancy requirements
2. **Develop load calculations** (DEL-17.03) to size transformers, switchgear, MCCs, and cables
3. **Coordinate with equipment packages** (PKG-10, PKG-11, PKG-13, PKG-15) for motor loads and control power requirements
4. **Coordinate with building package** (PKG-21, PKG-22) for MCC building electrical loads
5. **Confirm utility service parameters** (voltage, capacity, connection point, service charges)
6. **Obtain budgetary quotes** for transformers, switchgear, and MCCs
7. **Develop preliminary electrical layout** (DEL-17.01) to refine cable routing lengths
8. **Conduct soil resistivity survey** for grounding system design
9. **Determine hazardous area classification** requirements (if any areas require rated equipment)

### Next Estimate Iteration Triggers

- Load calculations complete (DEL-17.03)
- Electrical design drawings at 30% maturity (DEL-17.01)
- Vendor budgetary quotes received for major electrical equipment
