## Key Assumptions

1. Marine piling: 40-60 piles, avg 20m length, steel pipe piles or H-piles
2. Trestle: 150m length, 3m width, 150 tonnes structural steel, marine-grade corrosion protection
3. Loading platform: 20m × 15m, 80 tonnes structural steel
4. Catwalk: 50m length, 25 tonnes steel
5. Abutments: 2 units, 40 m³ concrete each
6. Marine environment: Fraser River tidal conditions, moderate current
7. Contractor: Specialized marine contractor with barge/crane capability
8. No escalation beyond January 2026 pricing

**All assumptions have LOW confidence pending design development and geotechnical investigation.**

## Key Risks

1. **Geotechnical conditions worse than assumed** (R-801): +$200k to +$500k
2. **Marine logistics constraints** (R-802): +$150k to +$400k
3. **Interfacing equipment loads exceed capacity** (R-803): +$100k to +$300k
4. **Regulatory approvals and permitting delays** (R-804): +$50k to +$200k
5. **Environmental design basis more severe** (R-805): +$100k to +$400k
6. **Marine contractor availability/pricing volatility** (R-806): +$200k to +$500k
7. **ER requirements not extracted** (R-807): +$100k to +$300k
8. **Schedule compression** (R-808): +$150k to +$500k

**Total Risk Exposure:** +$1,050k to +$3,100k (cumulative, not probabilistic)

**Contingency Provision:** $1,366,000 (25%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions to Improve Estimate

1. **Extract ER requirements** (Vol 2 Parts 1-2) for marine structures design criteria
2. **Initiate marine geotechnical investigation** (DEL-08.04) to confirm pile requirements
3. **Define design vessel characteristics** and berthing/mooring scenarios
4. **Obtain budgetary quotes** for marine piling supply and installation
5. **Develop preliminary trestle/platform layout** (DEL-08.01) to refine steel tonnages
6. **Coordinate with PKG-09 and PKG-11** for equipment loads and interface requirements

### Next Estimate Iteration Triggers

- Marine geotechnical report issued (DEL-08.04)
- Design drawings at 30% maturity (DEL-08.01)
- Vendor budgetary quotes received for piling and structural steel
- Berthing energy and mooring analysis complete (DEL-08.06, DEL-08.09)

## Exclusions

- Fenders and bollards supply/installation (PKG-09 Marine Outfitting)
- Marine loading arm and equipment (PKG-11 Marine Loading System)
- Employer-responsible permits and approvals
- Escalation beyond January 2026 pricing
- Taxes and financing costs
- Hazardous materials or contaminated soil remediation
- Utility relocations or conflicts
