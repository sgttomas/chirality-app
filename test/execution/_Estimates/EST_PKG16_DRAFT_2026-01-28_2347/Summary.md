## Estimate Basis Summary

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Estimate type | Order-of-magnitude allowance-based estimate |
| Pricing method | 100% allowances/parametric for materials and directs; factor-based for indirects/services |
| Quantity basis | Engineering judgment; no P&IDs or design quantities available (all deliverables INITIALIZED status) |
| Pricing basis | Typical market rates for BC Lower Mainland; no vendor quotes; stainless steel 316SS assumed |
| Valve count | Parametric estimate: 220 valves (30 control, 150 isolation, 20 relief, 20 strainers/specialty) |
| Valve sizes | Distribution assumption: 60% small (DN50-100), 30% medium (DN150-200), 10% large (DN250-300) |
| Actuation | Distribution assumption: 60% manual, 30% pneumatic, 10% electric |
| Materials | Stainless steel 316SS for product-contact valves (food-grade canola oil + coastal environment) |
| Indirects model | Factor-based per fallback typical model (CI=18%, P=2%, PM=6%, COM=3%) |
| Contingency method | PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance-heavy adjustments (20-35% by bucket; 24% overall) |

## Estimate Range

| Scenario | Base Estimate | Contingency | Total Estimate | Variance |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Low Estimate** (-30%) | $1,821,000 | $438,000 | $2,259,000 | -$968,000 |
| **Base Estimate** (Most Likely) | $2,602,000 | $625,000 | $3,227,000 | — |
| **High Estimate** (+50%) | $3,903,000 | $938,000 | $4,841,000 | +$1,614,000 |

**Expected Realization:** Base to High (+10% to +30% vs. base = $3,550k-$4,200k) due to:
- Parametric valve count tends to be conservative (underestimate)
- Vendor quotes often exceed typical market rates
- Actuation level often increases during detailed design (safety, operational efficiency)
- Engineering scope creep common (design revisions)

**Use Guideline:**
- **Investment Decision:** Use $3.2M-$4.8M range for budgeting
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Use base estimate $3.2M as planning baseline
- **Contingency Reserve:** Expect to draw down 40-70% of contingency during design/procurement

   - Labor rate tables (pipefitter, instrument tech, electrician all-in rates for BC)
   - Construction execution plan (crew makeup, productivity, valve installation duration)
   - Control philosophy (actuation requirements, fail-safe modes, automation level)
   - Hazardous area classification (actuator enclosure requirements)

### 4. **Expected accuracy improvement:**
   - **Class 4** (-20% to +30%) with P&IDs, datasheets, and 30-50% vendor quotes

  - Reflects equipment procurement package vs. construction package
  - Lower CD (6%) reflects relatively simple installation (bolt-up, hookup, testing)
- Total estimated valve count: **220 valves** across facility
  - Significant inventory (control, isolation, relief, strainers, specialty)
  - Interfaces with all process systems (PKG-10, PKG-11, PKG-12, PKG-13, PKG-14)
