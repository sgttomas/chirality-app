**Contingency Rationale:**
- Higher rates applied to E, MAT, CD due to high allowance share (>50%)
- E: 20% (100% allowance; no vendor data sheets)
- MAT: 20% (70% allowance; coating specification incomplete; no vendor quotes)
- CD: 25% (60% allowance; surface prep conditions unknown; marine access challenges)
- COM: 25% (food-grade acceptance testing and regulatory compliance risk)

| Structural steel surface area | 3,750 | m² | 150 t × 25 m²/t (D-2609) | LOW |
| Marine steel (coating) | 255 | tonnes | PKG-08 estimates (150t+80t+25t) | MED |

## Estimate Maturity and Confidence

| Assessment Category | Rating | Justification |
|---------------------|--------|---------------|
| **Overall Confidence** | LOW-MED | Derived quantities from related packages; high allowance share; no vendor quotes |
| **Quantity Confidence** | MED | Tank areas from PKG-13; steel tonnages from PKG-06/PKG-08; surface area factors assumed |
| **Pricing Confidence** | LOW | No vendor quotes; coating systems not specified; surface prep requirements TBD |
| **Scope Confidence** | MED | Scope defined in decomposition; interfaces identified; field painting extent uncertain |
| **Schedule Confidence** | LOW | No schedule; weather impacts unknown; marine access timing undefined |

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. Coating system specifications incomplete (DFT, coat counts, SSPC grades TBD)
2. No vendor quotes for food-grade tank linings or marine coatings
3. Surface preparation requirements and accessibility unknown
4. Field painting scope uncertain (field weld extents, touch-up quantities)
5. Marine exposure zones not defined (immersion/splash/atmospheric split)
6. VOC compliance strategy unknown (low-VOC coatings may increase cost)
7. Shop vs. field coating responsibilities not finalized with PKG-06 and PKG-08

## Comparison to Related Estimates

| Package | Scope | Estimate Total | Coating Component | PKG-26 Allocation |
|---------|-------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PKG-13 | Storage Tanks | $25,480,000 | $730,000 (tanks only) | $1,058,000 (tanks only) |
| PKG-06 | Structural Steelwork | $1,697,000 | Galvanizing included | $86,250 (field painting) |
| PKG-08 | Marine Structures | $6,829,000 | $125,000 (touch-up) | $397,800 (full marine coating) |

**Notes:**
- PKG-13 included lump sum allowances for tank coatings ($550k internal + $180k external = $730k)
- PKG-26 expands tank coating estimate to $1,058k (material + labor + surface prep + confined space support)
- PKG-06 included galvanizing in material costs; PKG-26 adds field painting over galvanized ($86k)
- PKG-08 included minimal coating touch-up allowance ($125k); PKG-26 provides comprehensive marine coating estimate ($398k)
- **No double-counting:** PKG-26 is the comprehensive coating scope; PKG-13/06/08 coating allowances should be removed if using PKG-26 estimate

## Next Steps to Improve Estimate

**Immediate actions (to reach Class 3 Budget):**
1. Complete DEL-26.01 coating specification (systems, DFT, surface prep grades)
2. Obtain vendor budgetary quotes for coating materials (food-grade, marine, structural)
3. Define shop vs. field coating responsibilities with PKG-06 and PKG-08
4. Define marine exposure zones and coating requirements
5. Quantify field painting scope from drawings/model

**Future actions (to reach Class 2 Definitive):**
1. Obtain firm vendor quotations for coating materials
2. Complete surface area takeoffs from 3D model or detailed drawings
3. Develop coating application schedule and resource plan
4. Complete food-grade certification and regulatory compliance verification
5. Finalize VOC compliance strategy and low-VOC coating requirements
