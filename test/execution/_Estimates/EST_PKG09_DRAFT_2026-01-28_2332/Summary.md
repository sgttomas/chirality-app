### Major Cost Drivers

| Item | Amount | % of Base | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Marine Fenders - Supply (12 units) | $1,020,000 | 45.4% | Heavy-duty rubber fenders @ ~$85k/unit |

| Project Management / EPCM | $114,000 | 5.1% | 6% factor on CD+CI+MAT |
| Ship-to-Shore Ladders - Supply | $72,000 | 3.2% | 4 units @ $18k/unit with safety features |

### Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quantities | LOW | All assumed from typical berth outfitting parametrics |
| Pricing | LOW | All allowances; no vendor quotes |
| Scope definition | LOW | Deliverables in INITIALIZED state |
| PKG-08 interface | LOW | Berthing/mooring analysis results not yet available |
| **Overall** | **LOW** | Placeholder estimate only |

### Key Assumptions

1. Berth face length of approximately 150m for Phase 1 (from PKG-08 scope)
2. 12 marine fenders at typical 10-15m spacing for Panamax vessel berthing
3. 8 mooring bollards (4 bow + 4 stern) with 300-500 kN SWL capacity
4. 4 ship-to-shore access ladders with safety cages and rest platforms per codes
5. Heavy-duty rubber fender systems with chains, anchors, and frontal frames
6. Cast or fabricated steel bollards with proof load testing @ 1.5x SWL
7. Marine installation via crane barge with tidal/weather constraints
8. Berth 10 repairs assumed minor (refurbishment/coating/hardware replacement)
9. BC lower mainland productivity factors (1.0 baseline)
10. Marine work seasonal window (May-October for favorable weather/tides)

### Exclusions

- Owner's costs
- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Marine structures (PKG-08)
- Berthing energy calculations (DEL-08.06)
- Mooring analysis (DEL-08.09)
- Fender design verification (DEL-08.08)
- Nitrogen supply skid (Employer-supplied)
- Escalation
- Taxes

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Obtain PKG-08 berthing energy calculations (DEL-08.06) for fender sizing
2. **Priority:** Obtain PKG-08 mooring analysis (DEL-08.09) for bollard capacity requirements
3. **Priority:** Obtain PKG-08 marine structure drawings (DEL-08.01) for interface coordination
4. Obtain budgetary quotes from marine equipment suppliers (fenders, bollards, ladders)
5. Conduct Berth 10 condition survey to confirm repair scope and cost assumptions
6. Progress deliverables from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS with defined scope
7. Coordinate marine installation sequencing and logistics with PKG-08 structural work
