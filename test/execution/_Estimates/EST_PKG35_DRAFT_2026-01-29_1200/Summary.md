## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Reduce Uncertainty)

1. **Obtain OEM training quotes** — Validate $200k+ of OEM training costs
2. **Define training scope with Employer** — Clarify modules, hours, trainees
3. **Confirm PKG-00 site establishment scope** — Defines reinstatement work

### Medium-Term (Improve Maturity)

4. **Develop project rate tables** for training and reinstatement labor
5. **Confirm contract defects liability terms** — 12-month period assumed
6. **Re-run estimate** with improved inputs (target Class 4)
