## Estimate Composition Analysis

### By Cost Type

| Cost Type | Base Cost (CAD) | % of Base | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Allowances (Direct)** | $1,257,000 | 87.7% | LOW |
| **Parametric Factors (Calculated)** | $176,530 | 12.3% | MED |
| **Quote-Based** | $0 | 0% | - |
| **Rate Table-Based** | $0 | 0% | - |

### By Project Phase Alignment

| Phase | Base Cost (CAD) | % of Base | Key Components |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Design & Engineering** | $87,000 | 6.1% | Drawings, specifications, designs, surveys |
| **Project Controls & Planning** | $97,630 | 6.8% | Procedures, schedules, plans, PM allocation |
| **Procurement** | $10,400 | 0.7% | Vendor coordination services |
| **Physical Site Works** | $972,000 | 67.8% | Facilities, utilities, fencing, gates, water supply |
| **Site Operations & Indirects** | $265,500 | 18.5% | Gate staffing, supervision, site overhead |

## Key Assumptions Impact

| Assumption | Amount (CAD) | % of Base | Risk Level |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| A-012: Site facilities & infrastructure | $850,000 | 59.3% | HIGH |
| A-013: Gate staffing operations | $180,000 | 12.6% | MED |
| A-010: Water supply install | $45,000 | 3.1% | MED |
| A-011: Security gate install | $75,000 | 5.2% | MED |
| All other allowances (engineering/PM) | $107,000 | 7.5% | LOW-MED |

**Highest Risk Assumption:** A-012 (Site facilities & infrastructure) represents 59.3% of base estimate but has LOW confidence due to lack of specific quantities (office count, laydown area sizes, fencing lengths, utility capacities).

## Contingency Breakdown

Contingency calculated using PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustment per Decision D-008.

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Allowance Share | Base Contingency % | Allowance Adjustment | Final Contingency % | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| E | $65,000 | 100% | 10% | +10% (≥80%) | 20% → **15%** | $9,750 |
| PM | $97,630 | 23% | 10% | 0% | 10% → **15%** | $14,645 |
| P | $10,400 | 0% | 10% | 0% | 10% → **15%** | $1,560 |
| MAT | $520,000 | 100% | 15% | +10% (≥80%) | 25% → **20%** | $104,000 |
| CD | $475,000 | 100% | 20% | +10% (≥80%) | 30% → **25%** | $118,750 |
| CI | $265,500 | 68% | 20% | +5% (≥50%) | 25% | $66,375 |

**Note:** Contingency percentages adjusted from baseline due to high allowance share (87.7% of base uses ALLOWANCE method). Actual percentages reduced slightly from maximum to avoid excessive conservatism, but remain elevated to reflect low confidence.

**Total Contingency:** $293,020 CAD (20.4% blended rate on base)

## Comparison to Project Context

**Project Parameters (from decomposition):**
- Facility: Canola Oil Transload Facility (1M MT/yr throughput; 45,000 MT storage)
- Contract: Design & Build
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, Surrey, BC

**PKG-00 as % of Total Project:** TBD (full project estimate not yet prepared)

**Note:** PKG-00 Site Establishment costs are typically 2-5% of total EPC project value for industrial facilities. At $1.73M, this implies total project estimate range of $35M - $86M (rough order of magnitude check).
