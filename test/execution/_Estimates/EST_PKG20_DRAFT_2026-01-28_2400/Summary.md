|--------|--------|
| Overall Confidence | LOW |
| Pricing Basis | 100% Allowance |
| Quantity Basis | Parametric (from facility scope) |
| Deliverable Status | INITIALIZED (scope not finalized) |

### Key Uncertainties

1. **Instrument Selection** — Specific instrument types/models not selected
2. **Hazardous Area Classification** — Instrument ratings assumed
3. **Cable Routing** — Routing not designed; lengths estimated
4. **P&ID Status** — P&IDs in development; instrument counts parametric
5. **Control System Integration** — Interface with PKG-19 not defined

## Comparison Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Instrumentation % of total process facility | 3-5% typical | Industry benchmark |
| This estimate relative to total project (~$150M) | ~1.3% | Within typical range |
| $/instrument installed (all-in) | ~$18,300 | This estimate |
| Industry typical $/instrument (process) | $12,000-25,000 | Benchmark range |

## Recommendations

1. **Develop Instrument Index** — Create preliminary instrument list from P&IDs to validate quantities
2. **Obtain Budgetary Quotes** — Request quotes from Emerson, Endress+Hauser, Siemens
3. **Complete Hazardous Area Study** — Confirm instrument ratings and enclosure requirements
4. **Coordinate with PKG-19** — Define control system interface and I/O requirements
5. **Progress Deliverables** — Advance DEL-20.01 through DEL-20.05 to IN_PROGRESS status
