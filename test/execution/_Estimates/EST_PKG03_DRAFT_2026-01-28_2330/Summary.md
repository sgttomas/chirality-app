| Pricing basis | Typical market rates for BC Lower Mainland; no vendor quotes |
| Indirects model | Factor-based per fallback typical model |
| Contingency method | PCT_BY_BUCKET with allowance-heavy adjustments (20-30% by bucket) |
| Escalation | None (current January 2026 dollars) |
| Accuracy class | Class 5 / Order of Magnitude (-30% to +50% typical range) |

## Next Estimate Iteration Requirements

To improve estimate accuracy for PKG-03:

1. **Complete design quantities:**
   - DEL-03.01 drawings with pipe sizes, lengths, manhole counts, OWS size, duct bank conduit schedules, trenchless crossing details
   - DEL-03.03 calculations with OWS capacity, retention volume, drainage flows, crossing structural requirements

2. **Obtain vendor pricing:**
   - OWS equipment budgetary quotes
   - Pipe material pricing (storm drainage, duct bank conduit, trenchless casing)
   - Manhole/catch basin pricing
   - Trenchless boring services quotes

3. **Provide project data:**
   - Engineering labor hours by discipline and deliverable
   - Construction labor and equipment rate tables
   - Site logistics plan with access constraints
   - Geotechnical report with soil conditions and groundwater levels
   - Environmental discharge permit requirements

4. **Expected accuracy improvement:** Class 4 (-20% to +30%) with design quantities and vendor quotes; Class 3 (-15% to +20%) with final design and firm quotes

## Reconciliation with Previous Packages

| Package | Deliverables | Base Total | Contingency | Estimate Total | Cost/Deliverable |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| PKG-00 Site Establishment | 8 | (prior estimate) | (prior) | (prior) | (prior) |
| PKG-01 Demolition & Removals | 4 | (prior estimate) | (prior) | (prior) | (prior) |
| PKG-02 Earthworks & Ground Improvement | 9 | $3,545,000 | $950,000 (27%) | $4,495,000 | $499k/deliverable |
| **PKG-03 Underground Utilities** | **6** | **$2,119,000** | **$568,000 (27%)** | **$2,687,000** | **$448k/deliverable** |

**Notes:**
- PKG-03 cost per deliverable ($448k) is slightly lower than PKG-02 ($499k), consistent with scope (PKG-03 has 6 deliverables vs PKG-02's 9)
- PKG-03 includes significant cost drivers: trenchless crossings ($265k CD) and OWS environmental system ($230k total)
- Both packages show 27% contingency rate due to 100% allowance-based pricing (see Risk_Register.md)
