## Contingency Calculation

Per D-018, contingency is calculated using PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustment:

| CBS | Base Amount | Base Rate | Allowance Share | Adjustment | Final Rate | Contingency |
|-----|-------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| E | $41,000 | 10% | 100% | +10% | 20% | $8,000 |
| PM | $94,660 | 10% | 100% | +10% | 20% | $19,000 |
| P | $800 | 10% | 100% | +10% | 20% | $200 |
| MAT | $40,000 | 15% | 100% | +10% | 25% | $10,000 |
| CD | $955,000 | 20% | 100% | +10% | 30% | $287,000 |
| CI | $171,000 | 20% | N/A (factor) | N/A | 0%* | $0 |
| **Total** | **$1,303,000** | | | | | **$326,000** |

*CI contingency embedded in CD contingency calculation (CI is factor of CD).

**Contingency Rate (overall):** 25.0% of base estimate

## Key Risks and Uncertainties

1. **Dolphin 2 Marine Demolition** — Largest cost item; marine work highly variable; no contractor quote
2. **Hazardous Materials** — Survey pending; if significant hazmat found, costs could increase $100k-$200k+
3. **Track 6 Ballast Contamination** — If ballast is contaminated, disposal costs increase significantly
4. **No Vendor Quotes** — 100% allowance-based; actual costs could vary ±50% from estimate

---

## Recommendations

1. **Obtain marine contractor quote** for Dolphin 2 demolition ($450k item)
2. **Complete hazmat survey** before finalizing estimate
3. **Obtain Track 6 as-built drawings** to determine track length and rail type
4. **Obtain demolition contractor quotes** for Track 6 and salt tent
5. **Establish engineering rate table** for deliverable development costs
