### Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quantities | LOW | Tank dimensions assumed from typical D/H ratios |
| Pricing | LOW | All allowances; no fabricator quotes for tanks |
| Scope definition | LOW | Deliverables in INITIALIZED state |
| Tank geometry | LOW | Design calculations not complete |
| Steel pricing | LOW | Volatile commodity market |
| Erection productivity | MEDIUM | BC lower mainland rates assumed |
| **Overall** | **LOW** | Placeholder estimate only |

### Key Assumptions

1. **3 × 15,000 MT API 650 tanks** for CSD canola oil storage (atmospheric)
2. Tank capacity ~16,300 m³ each (canola oil SG ~0.92)
3. Typical tank dimensions: ~30m diameter × ~24m shell height
4. Tank steel weight ~420 tonnes each (~1,260 tonnes total)
5. Field-erected tanks with shop-fabricated shell courses
6. Cone roof design (self-supporting)
7. Side-entry agitators (75 HP each) for product mixing
8. Food-grade internal coating for edible oil service
9. Seismic design required per API 650 Appendix E for BC location
10. Hydrostatic test with municipal water supply
11. Tank foundations by PKG-05 (interface only in this package)
12. Tank farm piping by PKG-14 (nozzle interface only)
13. Instrumentation by PKG-20 (nozzle provisions in this package)
14. BC lower mainland productivity factors (1.0 baseline)
15. Large crawler crane (200+ ton) available for erection

### Exclusions

- Land acquisition
- Permits obtained by Employer
- Tank foundations (PKG-05)
- Dyke/bund walls (PKG-05)
- Tank farm piping (PKG-14)
- Field instrumentation (PKG-20)
- Fire protection foam systems (PKG-23)
- Control system (PKG-19) — signals interface only
- Escalation
- Taxes

### Interface Packages

| Package | Interface | Cost Impact |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| PKG-05 Concrete Structures | Tank foundations, ringwall, anchor bolts, containment dyke | Foundation in PKG-05 |
| PKG-14 Process Piping | Tank nozzle connections, inlet/outlet headers | Nozzle flanges in PKG-13 |
| PKG-15 Pumps | Suction nozzle interface | Nozzle flanges in PKG-13 |
| PKG-17 Electrical | Agitator motor power supply | Cable termination at JB |
| PKG-19 Control Systems | Level/temperature signals, agitator control | Signal interface |
| PKG-20 Field Instrumentation | Level, temperature, pressure instruments | Nozzle provisions |
| PKG-23 Fire Protection | Foam chambers, detection | Penetrations in PKG-13 |
| PKG-26 Protective Coatings | Coating system specification | Assumed in tank vendor scope |

### Recommendations

1. **Priority:** Obtain budgetary quotes from API 650 tank fabricators (Matrix Service, CB&I, Tarsco, CST Industries)
2. **Priority:** Complete DEL-13.03 tank design calculations to confirm geometry and steel weight
3. **Priority:** Obtain side-entry agitator quotes (SPX Flow, Chemineer, Philadelphia Mixing)
4. Confirm canola oil product specification for coating selection
5. Complete seismic analysis per API 650 Appendix E for Surrey, BC
6. Coordinate with PKG-05 for foundation design and interface
7. Confirm internal coating system with food-grade coating supplier
8. Progress deliverables from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS with defined scope
9. Develop procurement strategy for tank fabrication (single-source vs competitive)
10. Confirm crane availability and access for tank erection sequence
