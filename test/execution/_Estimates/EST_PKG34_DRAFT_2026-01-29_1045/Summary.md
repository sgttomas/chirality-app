## Estimate Composition Analysis

### By Cost Type

| Cost Type | Base Cost (CAD) | % of Base | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Allowances (Direct)** | $370,000 | 85.6% | LOW |
| **Parametric Factors (Calculated)** | $62,000 | 14.4% | MED |
| **Quote-Based** | $0 | 0% | - |
| **Rate Table-Based** | $0 | 0% | - |

### By Activity Type

| Activity | Base Cost (CAD) | % of Base | Key Components |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Trenchless Crossing Monitoring** | $95,000 | 22.0% | Survey, instrumentation, monitoring, reporting |
| **Interface Management** | $90,000 | 20.8% | 4-5 major interface agreements with third parties |

## Key Assumptions Impact

| Assumption | Amount (CAD) | % of Base | Risk Level |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| A-001: Trenchless monitoring (2-4 crossings) | $95,000 | 22.0% | MED-HIGH |
| A-002: Interface agreements (4-5 major) | $90,000 | 20.8% | MED |
| A-003: Coordination meetings (100-130 meetings) | $75,000 | 17.4% | MED |
| A-004: Marine coordination (8-12 months) | $50,000 | 11.6% | MED |
| A-005: Security compliance (24-30 months) | $40,000 | 9.3% | LOW-MED |
| All parametric factors | $82,000 | 19.0% | MED |

**Highest Risk Assumption:** A-001 (Trenchless monitoring) represents 22.0% of base estimate with MED-HIGH uncertainty due to unknown crossing count and monitoring requirements.

## Contingency Breakdown

Contingency calculated using PCT_BY_BUCKET method with allowance-heavy adjustment per Decision D-008.

| CBS | Base (CAD) | Allowance Share | Base Contingency % | Allowance Adjustment | Final Contingency % | Contingency (CAD) |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| E | $95,000 | 79% | 10% | +10% (>=80% rounded) | **20%** | $19,000 |
| PM | $295,000 | 93% | 10% | +10% (>=80%) | **20%** | $59,000 |
| P | $6,000 | 0% | 10% | 0% | **15%** | $900 |
| CI | $36,000 | 0% | 20% | 0% | **25%** | $9,000 |

**Note:** Contingency percentages elevated from baseline due to high allowance share (85.6% of base uses ALLOWANCE method).

**Total Contingency:** $87,900 CAD (20.4% blended rate) -> Rounded to $88,000

## Comparison to Project Context

**Project Parameters (from decomposition):**
- Facility: Canola Oil Transload Facility (1M MT/yr throughput; 45,000 MT storage)
- Contract: Design & Build
- Location: Fraser Surrey Terminal, Surrey, BC
- Total Deliverables: 210 across 36 packages

**PKG-34 Coordination & Interfaces Context:**
- Discipline: Project Delivery
- Supports Objective: OBJ-5 (Terminal Continuity)
- Deliverable Count: 5
- Construction duration: Assumed 24-30 months

**Typical Interface Coordination Cost Benchmark:**
- Interface coordination typically 0.5-1.5% of construction cost
- For a project with ~$80M estimated construction, $400k-$1.2M coordination is reasonable
- PKG-34 estimate ($520k) is in the lower-mid range, appropriate for defined scope
