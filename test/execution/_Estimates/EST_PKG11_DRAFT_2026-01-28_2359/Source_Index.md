### Parametric Assumptions (Fallback)

| Parameter | Assumed Value | Basis |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Loading arm count | 1 unit | Single berth, single product terminal |
| Loading arm size | 12-16 inch nominal | 1,000,000 MT/annum throughput implies 2,000-4,000 m³/hr loading |
| Double-walled pipe length | 150 lm | Typical tank farm to berth routing |
| Leak detection zones | 3 zones | Annulus, drip trays, containment sump |
| Sump pump | 1 × 5 HP | Single containment sump typical |
| Operator shelter | 1 × 12 m² | Standard weather shelter |
