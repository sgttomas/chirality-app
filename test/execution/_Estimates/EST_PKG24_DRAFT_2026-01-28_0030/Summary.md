## Terminal Integration Considerations (DEC-05)

**Decision DEC-05:** Terminal network interfaces treated as multiple distinct systems
- **CCTV integration:** Separate video management interface with Terminal monitoring station
- **Access control integration:** Separate credential management and event reporting interface
- **Network integration:** Coordinated with PKG-25 Communications & IT for backbone

**Impact on Estimate:**
- VMS software allowance includes Terminal integration capability ($25k)
- Access control software allowance includes Terminal integration capability ($18k)
- Network equipment sized for segregated VLANs and firewall requirements
- Commissioning includes Terminal integration testing and coordination (included in COM factor)

**Risks:**
- Terminal integration protocols and requirements TBD (see Risk R-006)
- Existing Terminal security system documentation not available
- Network security requirements (VLANs, firewall rules) TBD
- Credential synchronization method TBD

## Next Estimate Iteration Requirements

To improve estimate accuracy for PKG-24:

1. **Complete design quantities:**
   - DEL-24.01 coverage analysis with camera counts, locations, coverage zones
   - DEL-24.01 access control layout with controlled door/gate locations and access levels
   - DEL-24.01 cable routing with conduit lengths and sizes
   - DEL-24.02 equipment specifications (resolution, frame rate, retention period, reader technology)

2. **Obtain vendor pricing:**
   - Security system integrator budgetary quotes for turnkey system
   - CCTV equipment pricing (cameras, NVR, VMS software)
   - Access control equipment pricing (readers, controllers, software, door hardware)
   - Network equipment pricing (PoE switches, fiber equipment, UPS)
   - Installation labor rates for security systems technicians

3. **Provide project data:**
   - Terminal security integration requirements (protocols, credentials, network topology)
   - Existing Terminal security system documentation and as-builts
   - Engineering labor hours by discipline and deliverable
   - Construction schedule with phasing and Terminal coordination constraints
   - Site survey with mounting locations and cable routing constraints

4. **Coordinate with related packages:**
   - PKG-17 electrical: Power supply locations and circuits
   - PKG-23 fire protection: Access control integration with fire alarm
   - PKG-25 communications: Network backbone details and IP addressing
   - PKG-03 underground utilities: Conduit routing coordination

5. **Expected accuracy improvement:** Class 4 (-20% to +30%) with design quantities and vendor quotes; Class 3 (-15% to +20%) with final design and firm quotes

## Reconciliation with Previous Packages

| Package | Deliverables | Base Total | Contingency | Estimate Total | Cost/Deliverable |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| PKG-12 Product Transfer & Metering | 5 | $1,426,000 | $366,000 (26%) | $1,792,000 | $358k/deliverable |
| PKG-19 Control Systems | 5 | $1,801,000 | $450,000 (25%) | $2,251,000 | $450k/deliverable |
| PKG-20 Field Instrumentation | 5 | $1,535,000 | $408,000 (27%) | $1,943,000 | $389k/deliverable |
| **PKG-24 Security Systems** | **4** | **$833,000** | **$214,000 (26%)** | **$1,047,000** | **$262k/deliverable** |

**Notes:**
- PKG-24 cost per deliverable ($262k) is lower than instrumentation/control packages, consistent with smaller deliverable count (4 vs 5) and less complex equipment
- PKG-24 contingency rate (26%) is consistent with other instrumentation/control packages due to 100% allowance-based pricing
- PKG-24 materials (43% of base) is higher proportion than typical civil/structural packages but lower than equipment-intensive packages like PKG-13 Storage Tanks
- PKG-24 includes significant Terminal integration complexity per DEC-05 (separate CCTV and access control interfaces)
