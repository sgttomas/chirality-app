## Known Gaps and Limitations

1. No vendor quotes or rate tables (100% allowance-based pricing)
2. Equipment quantities based on engineering judgment (design incomplete)
3. Terminal integration requirements TBD
4. Employer's Requirements Volume 2 not available
5. Underground conduit routing coordination with PKG-03, PKG-17, PKG-25 TBD
6. Escalation not included (current January 2026 dollars)

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete DEL-24.01 coverage design with camera counts and locations
2. Obtain budgetary quotes from security system integrators
3. Obtain Terminal security integration specification
4. Coordinate underground routing with related packages
5. Re-estimate to upgrade from Class 5 to Class 4/3
