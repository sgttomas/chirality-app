## Significant Changes

### None (Initial Estimate)

This is the first estimate produced for PKG-30 Commissioning. No changes to report.

---

## Methodology Changes

### None (Initial Estimate)

- Estimate methodology: PCT_BY_BUCKET contingency method per _CONFIG.md
- Pricing hierarchy: Quotes (0%) → Rate tables (15%) → Allowances (72%) → Parametric (13%)
- Estimate class: Class 5 (Conceptual / Order of Magnitude)

No methodology changes (initial estimate uses standard project methodology).

---

## Scope Changes

### None (Initial Estimate)

Scope as defined in Decomposition §5 PKG-30:
- 8 deliverables (DEL-30.01 through DEL-30.08)
- Pre-commissioning, system commissioning, integrated systems testing, start-up, performance verification, defect rectification
- All facility systems: railcar unloading (32 stations), storage tanks (3 tanks), product transfer, metering, marine loading, electrical, I&C, fire protection, security, cathodic protection

No scope changes (initial estimate).

---

## Key Assumptions (Initial Estimate)

**Duration Assumptions:**
- Total commissioning duration: 30 weeks (~7.5 months)
- Phased approach: Pre-commissioning (8 wks), System commissioning (12 wks), IST (6 wks), Start-up/performance (4 wks)
- Terminal continuity constraints extend duration by ~20%

**Resource Assumptions:**
- Average commissioning team: 10 FTE (variable 6-14 FTE across phases)
- Commissioning labor rates: $85-135/hr fully burdened

**Scope Assumptions:**
- ~30 commissioning procedures required (10 pre-commissioning, 15 system, 5 start-up)
- Vendor support required for tanks, metering (proving), marine loading, control systems
- Specialized metering proving: 3 weeks with specialist support

See Assumptions_Log.md for complete assumption details (A-001 through A-025).

## Next Estimate Iteration Recommendations

For the next estimate update, focus on:

**Priority 1 (Scope Definition):**
1. Develop commissioning procedures (DEL-30.01) to detailed outline level
2. Obtain construction/commissioning schedule with system handover dates
3. Develop commissioning plan (DEL-30.02) with detailed resource loading

**Priority 2 (Vendor Input):**
4. Obtain vendor quotes for specialized commissioning support (metering proving, tank instrumentation, marine loading)
5. Coordinate with equipment packages for vendor commissioning requirements
6. Obtain test equipment rental quotes

**Priority 3 (Requirements Clarification):**
7. Confirm terminal operations constraints and work windows with Employer
8. Define performance test acceptance criteria (DEL-30.06)
9. Coordinate with PKG-32 for regulatory witness point requirements

**Expected Improvement:** Implementing Priority 1-2 recommendations would enable estimate maturity upgrade to Class 4 (-20% to +30% accuracy).

## Notes

**Estimate Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM
- 72% of base cost is allowance/parametric (limited vendor quotes and detailed scope)
- Commissioning labor rates have MEDIUM confidence (BC market rates)
- Duration assumptions have LOW-MEDIUM confidence (no construction schedule)
- Vendor support scope has LOW confidence (requirements TBD)

**Estimate Status:** DRAFT with WARNINGS
- Suitable for budgeting and conceptual planning
- Not suitable for cost control baseline or commitments
- Scope refinement required for improved accuracy

**Next Update Trigger:**
- Commissioning procedures (DEL-30.01) developed to detailed outline
- Construction schedule available with system handover dates
- Vendor quotes obtained for specialized commissioning support
- Material changes to commissioning scope or approach
