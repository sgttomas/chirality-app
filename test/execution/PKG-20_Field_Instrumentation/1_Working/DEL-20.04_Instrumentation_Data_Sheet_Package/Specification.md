# Specification: DEL-20.04 Instrumentation Data Sheet Package

## Scope

Defines requirements for **Instrumentation Data Sheet Package** within **PKG-20 Field Instrumentation** for the Canola Oil Transload Facility Phase 1.

**Deliverable Purpose:** Defines and substantiates instrumentation in accordance with ER requirements.

**Source:** Decomposition document, DEL-20.04 (line 499)

**Data Sheet Scope:** Equipment data sheets for level, pressure, temperature, and flow instruments (coordinate custody transfer flow with PKG-12).

**Anticipated Artifacts:** Level transmitter data sheets, pressure transmitter data sheets, flow instrument data sheets, temperature element data sheets.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Data Sheet Completeness**

Data sheets shall be provided for all field instruments requiring procurement, installation verification, or asset tracking. Minimum content: identification, service conditions, performance, construction, electrical, certifications.

**FR-2: Specification Compliance**

Data sheets shall demonstrate compliance with DEL-20.02 specification requirements (ranges, accuracy, materials, hazardous area ratings).

**FR-3: Calculation Alignment**

Data sheets shall incorporate calculated ranges and parameters from DEL-20.03 (verified sizing, accuracy budgets).

**FR-4: Vendor Data**

Vendor-completed data sheets shall include: manufacturer, model number, actual specifications, certifications, delivery schedule, pricing (if procurement data sheet).

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on typical data sheet functional requirements

### Performance Requirements

**PR-1: Data Sheet Format**

Standardized tabular format per project standards. **TBD**: Format (Excel, database, PDF forms).

**PR-2: Traceability**

Each data sheet cross-referenced to: P&ID (instrument tag), DEL-20.02 specification, DEL-20.03 calculations, DEL-20.01 drawings.

**PR-3: Revision Control**

Data sheets revision-controlled through procurement and as-built phases. Vendor submittals tracked separately from design data sheets.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on typical data sheet management requirements

### Interface Requirements

**INT-1: Procurement Interface**

Data sheets issued to vendors with RFQs. Vendor-completed data sheets evaluated for compliance. Approved vendor data forms basis of purchase orders.

**INT-2: Construction Interface**

Data sheets provide installation reference (mounting, connections, power). As-built data updated with serial numbers and field modifications.

**INT-3: Operations Interface**

Final data sheets become asset records for maintenance, calibration schedules, spare parts procurement.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on typical data sheet lifecycle

### Quality Requirements

**QR-1: Design Data Sheet Review**

Design data sheets (issued to vendors) reviewed by independent checker before RFQ issuance.

**QR-2: Vendor Data Sheet Review**

Vendor submittals reviewed against specification requirements. Non-compliances documented and resolved before approval.

**QR-3: As-Built Verification**

As-built data sheets verified against installed equipment (serial numbers, test results from DEL-20.05).

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on typical EPC quality procedures

## Standards

Applicable standards per DEL-20.02 specification (ISA 5.1 tagging, ISA 84 safety requirements, CSA C22.1 hazardous area, API 554 installation).

## Verification

Design data sheets: independent check. Vendor data sheets: compliance review against specification. As-built data sheets: field verification.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Data sheets complete, compliant with specification, calculations verified, vendor certifications provided, as-built data matches installed equipment.

## Documentation

**Required Outputs:** Level transmitter data sheets, pressure transmitter data sheets, flow instrument data sheets, temperature element data sheets (organized by instrument type or tag number).

**Format:** **TBD** — Per project data sheet standards

**Management:** Version control through design/procurement/as-built phases. Final data sheets archived as permanent facility records.

**Project Objective Alignment:** Supports **OBJ-1: Safe & Reliable Operation** and **OBJ-9: Lifecycle Cost Optimization** (asset records support maintenance planning).
