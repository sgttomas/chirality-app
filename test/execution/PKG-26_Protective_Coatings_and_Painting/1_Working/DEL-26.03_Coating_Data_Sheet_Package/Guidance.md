# Guidance: DEL-26.03 Coating Data Sheet Package

## Purpose

This deliverable compiles manufacturer technical data sheets for coating materials specified in DEL-26.01, supporting coating selection, procurement, application, and inspection.

**Deliverable classification:** Data Sheet, Coatings discipline, D&B Contractor

**Project objectives:** OBJ-3 (Storage Capacity — food-grade compliance), OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization — performance data for lifecycle analysis)

## Principles

**Data Sheet Role in Coating Quality:**

Manufacturer data sheets are the authoritative source for product-specific application requirements. Coating performance depends on following manufacturer recommendations for:
- Surface preparation (SSPC standard, profile depth)
- Mixing (ratios, pot life, induction time)
- Application (spray parameters, WFT for target DFT)
- Environmental limits (temperature, humidity, dew point)
- Recoat windows (minimum/maximum time between coats)
- Cure (time to handle, time to service)

**Source:** DEL-26.02 (Guidance — Application Quality Control); **ASSUMPTION**

**FDA/NSF Compliance for Food-Contact Coatings:**

Tank internal coatings contacting canola oil (food product) require compliance certificates:
- **FDA 21 CFR 175.300:** U.S. regulation for food-contact coatings
- **NSF/ANSI 61:** Potable water/food-contact standard (or equivalent)
- Manufacturer must provide current certificates with coating data sheets

**Source:** DEL-26.01 (PR-1, Guidance — Food Contact Regulations)

## Considerations

**Data Sheet Sourcing:**

- Obtain data sheets during coating system selection (design phase) or procurement (bidding phase)
- Verify data sheets are current versions from manufacturer
- Organize data sheets by application for ease of use during construction

**Coordination:**

- **DEL-26.01:** Data sheets must correspond to coating systems specified
- **DEL-26.02:** Procedures will reference data sheets for application parameters
- **DEL-26.04:** Inspection will reference data sheets for acceptance criteria

## Trade-offs

**Brand-Specific vs. Generic Data Sheets:**

- Brand-specific data sheets: Obtained after coating product selection or during procurement
- Generic data sheets: Industry-typical products for reference during specification phase

**Recommendation:** Include both generic/reference data sheets during specification phase (DEL-26.01 development) and brand-specific data sheets after product selection/procurement.
