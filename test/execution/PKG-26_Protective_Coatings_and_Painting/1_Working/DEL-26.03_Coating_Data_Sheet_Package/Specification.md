# Specification: DEL-26.03 Coating Data Sheet Package

## Scope

This specification defines requirements for the coating data sheet package that provides manufacturer technical data for coating materials specified in DEL-26.01.

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-26.03

### Inclusions

- Manufacturer product data sheets for all coating systems specified in DEL-26.01
- FDA/NSF compliance certificates for food-contact coatings (tank internals)
- Application guides with environmental limits, cure times, recoat windows
- Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for all coating materials
- Performance data (adhesion, DFT, durability, corrosion resistance)
- Abrasive technical data sheets

## Requirements

**FR-1: Complete Coverage**
- Data sheets shall be provided for all coating systems specified in DEL-26.01 (tank internal, tank external, structural steel, marine, field touch-up)
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (all coating types); Datasheet.md

**FR-2: Food-Grade Compliance Documentation**
- Tank internal coating data sheets shall include FDA/NSF compliance certificates demonstrating food-contact suitability
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (PR-1 Food Contact Compliance)

**FR-3: Application Parameters**
- Data sheets shall provide application parameters required by DEL-26.02 Procedures: pot life, mixing ratios, environmental limits (temperature, humidity, dew point), recoat windows, cure times
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (PR-6); DEL-26.02 (application procedures)

**FR-4: Acceptance Criteria Data**
- Data sheets shall provide acceptance criteria data: recommended DFT, adhesion test methods and acceptance values, surface preparation requirements
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (PR-3, PR-4, PR-5); DEL-26.04 (inspection)

**QR-1: Current and Accurate**
- All data sheets shall be current manufacturer-issued versions (not outdated)
- Data sheets shall be legible and complete
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Quality requirement for data sheet package

## Standards

- FDA 21 CFR 175.300 (food-contact coatings) — compliance certificates required
- NSF/ANSI 61 (or equivalent) — compliance certificates required
- ISO 12944 (durability classification data)
- SSPC, NACE, ASTM standards (referenced in manufacturer data sheets)
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (Standards section)

## Verification

- Verify data sheets provided for all coating systems specified in DEL-26.01
- Verify FDA/NSF certificates included for tank internal coatings
- Verify data sheets contain required application parameters and acceptance criteria
- Verify data sheets are current and legible

## Documentation

**Required outputs:**
- Coating system data sheets (by application per Datasheet.md)
- Organized package (folders or binders by coating application)
- Index or table of contents
- **Source:** Decomposition DEL-26.03 anticipated artifacts
