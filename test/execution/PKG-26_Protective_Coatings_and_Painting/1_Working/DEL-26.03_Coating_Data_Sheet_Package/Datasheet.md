## Conditions

This deliverable compiles manufacturer data sheets for all coating materials specified in DEL-26.01, providing product-specific information for procurement, application (DEL-26.02), and inspection (DEL-26.04).

**Applications Covered:**
- Tank internal coatings (food-grade, FDA/NSF compliant)
- Tank external coatings (atmospheric corrosion protection)
- Structural steel coatings (atmospheric corrosion protection)
- Marine coatings (immersion/splash/atmospheric zones)
- Field touch-up coatings
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (Datasheet — Construction)

## Construction

**Materials / Configuration:**

### Required Data Sheets by Application

**1. Tank Internal Coatings:**
- Product data sheet (material description, properties, chemical resistance)
- Application guide (surface prep, mixing, pot life, application method, DFT, environmental limits, recoat windows, cure)
- FDA/NSF compliance certificate
- Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
- Performance data (adhesion, DFT, durability)
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (PR-1 Food Contact Compliance)

**2. Tank External / Structural Steel Coatings:**
- Product data sheets for primer, intermediate, topcoat (each coat)
- Application guides (each coat)
- SDS (each coat)
- Performance data (adhesion, DFT, corrosion resistance, ISO 12944 durability)
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (PR-2, PR-4, PR-6)

**3. Marine Coatings:**
- Product data sheet (marine service suitability)
- Application guide (typically higher DFT for marine service)
- SDS
- Performance data (adhesion, abrasion resistance, immersion resistance)
- **Source:** DEL-26.01 (Datasheet — Marine Coatings)

**4. Abrasives (Surface Preparation):**
- Abrasive technical data (type, size, profile characteristics)
- SDS (silica content, dust control)
- **Source:** DEL-26.02 (Surface Preparation Procedures)
