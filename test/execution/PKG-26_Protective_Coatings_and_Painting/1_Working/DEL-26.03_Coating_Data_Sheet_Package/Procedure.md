# Procedure: DEL-26.03 Coating Data Sheet Package

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for compiling and organizing the coating data sheet package.

**Deliverable type:** Data Sheet
**Responsible:** D&B Contractor
**Output:** Organized package of manufacturer data sheets for all coating systems per DEL-26.01

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** DEL-26.01 (Coating Technical Specification) — defines coating systems for which data sheets are required

**Source:** Decomposition deliverable relationships

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify Required Data Sheets

1.1. Review DEL-26.01 to identify all coating systems specified:
- Tank internal coatings (product, manufacturer or performance spec)
- Tank external coatings (primer, intermediate, topcoat)
- Structural steel coatings
- Marine coatings
- Field touch-up coatings
- Abrasives

1.2. For each coating system, identify required data sheets per Specification.md (FR-1 through FR-4):
- Product data sheet
- Application guide
- FDA/NSF certificates (tank internals)
- SDS
- Performance data

### Step 2: Obtain Data Sheets

2.1. **Source data sheets:**
- Manufacturer websites (download current versions)
- Coating suppliers (request during procurement/bidding)
- Manufacturer technical support (request by email/phone)

2.2. **Verify data sheets:**
- Current manufacturer-issued versions (not outdated)
- Legible and complete
- Correspond to coating systems specified in DEL-26.01

2.3. **Obtain FDA/NSF certificates for tank internal coatings:**
- Request from manufacturer
- Verify certificate is current and covers the specific product

### Step 3: Organize Data Sheet Package

3.1. **Create package structure:**
- Folders or binders organized by coating application (tank internal, tank external, structural steel, marine, abrasives)
- Index / table of contents

3.2. **Compile data sheets into package:**
- Place data sheets in appropriate folders/binders
- Ensure all required data sheets present per Specification.md

3.3. **Create index:**
- List all data sheets included (product name, manufacturer, data sheet date/revision)

### Step 4: Verification

4.1. **Verify completeness:**
- All coating systems from DEL-26.01 have data sheets
- FDA/NSF certificates included for tank internals
- All required data sheet types present (product data, application guide, SDS)

4.2. **Verify quality:**
- Data sheets current and legible
- Data sheets contain required information (application parameters per FR-3, acceptance criteria per FR-4)

### Step 5: Issue Package

5.1. **Issue data sheet package:**
- Distribute to DEL-26.02 (procedure authors), DEL-26.04 (QA/QC for inspection), coating applicators, procurement

5.2. **Update deliverable status:**
- Update `_STATUS.md` to reflect issuance

## Verification

**Acceptance criteria:**
- ✓ Data sheets provided for all coating systems specified in DEL-26.01
- ✓ FDA/NSF certificates included for tank internal coatings
- ✓ Data sheets contain required application parameters and acceptance criteria
- ✓ Data sheets current and legible
- ✓ Package organized and indexed

**Source:** Specification.md (Verification section)

## Records

**Documentation output:** Coating Data Sheet Package (organized folders/binders with index)

**Filing location:** `3_Issued/DEL-26.03_Coating_Data_Sheet_Package/` (or per project document management system)

**Distribution:** DEL-26.02 authors, DEL-26.04 QA/QC, coating applicators, procurement, related disciplines

**Source:** Specification.md (Documentation section)
