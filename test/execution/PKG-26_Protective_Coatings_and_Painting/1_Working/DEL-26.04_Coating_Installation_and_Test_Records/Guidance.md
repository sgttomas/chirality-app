# Guidance: DEL-26.04 Coating Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This deliverable provides record templates and compiles completed records that demonstrate coating quality and compliance with DEL-26.01 requirements. Records provide traceability for acceptance, warranty, and project closeout.

**Deliverable classification:** Record, Coatings discipline, D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

**Project objectives:**
- OBJ-1 (Safe & Reliable Operation) — Quality records support reliable coating performance
- OBJ-3 (Storage Capacity) — Tank coating records demonstrate food-grade compliance
- OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization) — Records support warranty claims and lifecycle maintenance planning

## Principles

**Records as Quality Evidence:**

Coating records serve multiple purposes:
- **Quality control:** In-process records (surface prep, DFT during application) prevent defects from progressing
- **Acceptance:** Final records demonstrate compliance with DEL-26.01 requirements for acceptance
- **Traceability:** Records document what was done, when, by whom, under what conditions
- **Warranty:** Records support warranty claims if coating failures occur
- **Maintenance:** Records inform future maintenance (when coating was applied, what system, expected service life)

**Source:** DEL-26.01 (QR-2 Documentation); **ASSUMPTION** — Quality management principles

**Inspector Independence:**

Records should be verified and signed by independent inspectors (not the applicator who performed the work). Coating inspectors should be qualified per industry standards (NACE/AMPP Coating Inspector Level 2 or equivalent).

**Source:** DEL-26.01 (QR-3 Workmanship); **ASSUMPTION** — Quality inspector independence

## Considerations

**Record Timing:**

- **Surface preparation records:** Completed immediately after surface prep, before coating application (hold point)
- **Application records:** Completed during coating application (environmental conditions, WFT measurements)
- **DFT records:** Completed after coating cure (after each coat or after final coat)
- **Adhesion and holiday detection records:** Completed after final cure before final acceptance
- **Final acceptance records:** Completed after all inspection and testing passed

**Coordination:**

- **DEL-26.01:** Records demonstrate compliance with specification requirements
- **DEL-26.02:** Procedures generate records during execution (record templates referenced in procedures)
- **PKG-30:** Tank internal coating records submitted to commissioning for food-grade acceptance

## Trade-offs

**Paper vs. Electronic Records:**

- Paper records: Traditional, simple, no technology dependency, but storage and retrieval challenges
- Electronic records: Easier storage/retrieval/search, but require technology infrastructure and cyber security

**Recommendation:** Use project-standard record format (paper or electronic per project DMS requirements)

**100% Records vs. Sampling:**

- 100% records: Complete traceability for all areas, but high administrative burden
- Sampling records: Reduced administrative burden, but gaps in traceability

**Recommendation:** 100% records for critical applications (tank internals — food-grade, immersion service); sampling acceptable for less critical (structural steel atmospheric with spot inspection per DEL-26.01 QR-1)

SURFACE PREPARATION RECORD

Project: Canola Oil Transload Facility
Location/Area: Tank T-01 Interior, Grid Section A1
Date: ____________  Time: ____________

Surface Preparation Method:
☐ SSPC-SP 1 (Solvent Cleaning)
☐ SSPC-SP 3 (Power Tool Cleaning)
☐ SSPC-SP 5 (White Metal Blast)
☐ SSPC-SP 6 (Commercial Blast)
☑ SSPC-SP 10 (Near-White Blast)
☐ SSPC-SP 11 (Power Tool to Bare Metal)

Environmental Conditions:
- Ambient Temperature: ______°C
- Relative Humidity: ______%
- Surface Temperature: ______°C
- Dew Point: ______°C
- Weather: ☐ Dry  ☐ Rain  ☐ Wind (describe): __________

Abrasive (if blast cleaning):
- Type: Coal Slag     - Size: 30/60 mesh

Surface Cleanliness Verification:
- Visual inspection per SSPC-VIS 1: ☑ SSPC-SP 10 achieved (≥ 95% clean)
- Surface Profile Measurement (ASTM D4417): 2.2 mils (target 1.5-2.5 mils)

ACCEPTANCE FOR COATING APPLICATION:
☑ YES — Surface preparation acceptable, coating may proceed
☐ NO — Surface preparation not acceptable, corrective action required
