# Procedure: DEL-26.04 Coating Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for creating record templates and managing completed coating installation and test records.

**Deliverable type:** Record
**Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)
**Output:** Record templates and compiled completed records demonstrating coating compliance

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:**
- DEL-26.01 (Coating Technical Specification) — Defines inspection requirements and acceptance criteria documented in records
- DEL-26.02 (Coating Procedures) — Procedures reference and generate these records during execution

**Source:** Decomposition deliverable relationships

## Steps

### Step 1: Create Record Templates

1.1. **Identify required record types** (per Datasheet.md and DEL-26.01 QR-2, DEL-26.02 documentation requirements):
- Surface preparation records
- Coating application records
- DFT measurement records
- Adhesion test records
- Holiday detection records (for immersion service)
- Final acceptance records

1.2. **Design record templates** (forms) for each record type:
- Include all required fields per Specification.md (FR-2 Traceability, FR-3 Acceptance Criteria)
- Include signature blocks (applicator, inspector, QA/QC)
- Use project-standard format (paper forms or electronic forms per project DMS)

1.3. **Review and approve templates:**
- Review templates with coating inspectors and QA/QC
- Verify templates capture all required information
- Approve templates for use

1.4. **Distribute templates:**
- Provide templates to coating applicators, inspectors, QA/QC
- Reference templates in DEL-26.02 Procedures (so procedures specify which templates to use)

### Step 2: Generate Records During Coating Work

2.1. **Records are completed during coating work** per DEL-26.02 Procedures:
- Surface preparation records: Completed by inspector at surface prep hold point
- Application records: Completed by applicator and inspector during coating application
- DFT records: Completed by inspector after coating cure
- Adhesion test records: Completed by inspector after adhesion testing
- Holiday detection records: Completed by inspector during holiday detection
- Final acceptance records: Completed by inspector at final acceptance

2.2. **Quality control during record generation:**
- Verify all fields completed (legible, no blanks)
- Verify signatures obtained (applicator, inspector per template)
- Verify acceptance criteria documented and results recorded

### Step 3: Collect and Verify Records

3.1. **Collect completed records** from field/shop:
- QA/QC collects completed records from inspectors on regular basis (daily or weekly)

3.2. **Verify record completeness** per Specification.md (QR-1):
- All required fields completed
- Legible
- Signed by responsible personnel

3.3. **Verify record coverage** per Specification.md (FR-1):
- Records provided for all coating activities (all areas prepared, coated, inspected, tested, accepted)
- No missing records

3.4. **Address deficiencies:**
- If records incomplete: Return to inspector for completion
- If records missing: Identify and obtain missing records

### Step 4: Organize and File Records

4.1. **Organize records:**
- By coating application (tank internal, tank external, structural steel, marine)
- By record type (surface prep, application, DFT, adhesion, holiday detection, final acceptance)
- Chronological order within each category

4.2. **Create index:**
- List all records filed (record type, date, location/area)

4.3. **File records:**
- File in project record management system or designated folder structure
- Filing location: Per project DMS or `3_Issued/DEL-26.04_Coating_Installation_and_Test_Records/`

### Step 5: Submit Records for Acceptance and Closeout

5.1. **Submit records package for review:**
- QA/QC reviews complete records package
- Verify all coating work documented and accepted

5.2. **Distribute records:**
- Commissioning team (PKG-30 for tank internal coating records — food-grade acceptance)
- Project closeout documentation package
- Owner (as-built records)

5.3. **Update deliverable status:**
- Update `_STATUS.md` to reflect completion and submission

## Verification

**Acceptance criteria:**
- ✓ Record templates created for all required record types (Datasheet.md — 6 types)
- ✓ Completed records provided for all coating activities (complete coverage per FR-1)
- ✓ Records provide traceability (all required fields complete per FR-2)
- ✓ Acceptance criteria documented and results recorded (per FR-3)
- ✓ Records legible, complete, and signed (per QR-1)
- ✓ Records organized and filed per project requirements
- ✓ Records submitted to commissioning (PKG-30) and project closeout

**Source:** Specification.md (Verification section)

## Records

**Documentation outputs:**
- Record templates (6 types per Datasheet.md)
- Completed records (quantity depends on coating work scope — all areas coated, inspected, tested, accepted)

**Filing location:** Per project DMS or `3_Issued/DEL-26.04_Coating_Installation_and_Test_Records/`

**Retention:** Per project record retention requirements — **TBD**

**Distribution:**
- QA/QC (record management)
- Commissioning (PKG-30 for tank internal coating records)
- Project closeout package
- Owner (as-built records)
