# Guidance: DEL-32.03 VFPA PER Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Supports **VFPA PER Compliance Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-32 Regulatory & Permits**.

**Purpose:** Provides evidence of VFPA PER compliance. (Source: _CONTEXT.md; Datasheet.md)
**Type:** Record | **Discipline:** Project Delivery | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)
**Objective:** Supports OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance

## Principles

### 1. Condition-Driven Compliance (supports Specification.md FR-01, FR-02)
Each VFPA PER condition defines specific compliance requirements. Compliance demonstration is condition-specific.

### 2. Proactive Tracking (supports Specification.md FR-02, FR-05)
Establish tracking system early; monitor compliance throughout project phases.

### 3. Evidence-Based Demonstration (supports Specification.md FR-03)
Compliance must be objectively verifiable through inspection reports, test results, monitoring data, or submittals.

## Considerations

### VFPA PER Condition Categories (Typical)
- **Environmental management:** Environmental Management Plans, spill prevention, erosion control, marine environmental monitoring
- **Marine protection:** Water quality monitoring, marine mammal observation, debris management
- **Construction management:** Work windows, noise monitoring, traffic management, notifications
- **Stakeholder engagement:** Communication protocols, complaint management
- **Submittals to VFPA:** Progress reports, monitoring reports, as-built drawings

### Compliance Phases
- **Pre-construction:** Conditions satisfied before work starts (e.g., submit management plans, provide insurance)
- **During-construction:** Ongoing compliance (e.g., environmental monitoring, work restrictions)
- **Post-construction:** Conditions after completion (e.g., as-builts, site restoration, final reports)

### Interface with DEL-32.02
PER approval (DEL-32.02) → Extract conditions → Assign to DEL-32.03 → Track compliance → Demonstrate compliance

## Trade-offs

### Centralized vs Distributed Compliance Management
- **Centralized (QA/QC):** Consistent tracking; clear accountability; potential bottleneck
- **Distributed (discipline leads):** Discipline expertise; faster response; coordination challenges
- **Recommendation:** Centralized tracking with distributed execution

## Examples

**Example PER Condition:**
"Environmental monitoring shall be conducted weekly during marine works. Monitoring results shall be submitted to VFPA monthly."

**Compliance demonstration:**
- Establish monitoring protocol
- Conduct weekly monitoring
- Compile monthly reports
- Submit to VFPA
- File VFPA acknowledgment and monitoring data in DEL-32.03
