(See Guidance.md for detailed examples; **TBD**: Confirm from actual PER approval)

- Environmental management and monitoring
- Marine environmental protection (spill prevention, marine water quality)
- Construction management (work windows, noise limits, traffic management)
- Stakeholder engagement and communication
- Heritage and archaeological resources (if applicable)
- Reporting and submittals to VFPA

**Scope boundary:**

- This deliverable covers compliance with VFPA PER approval conditions only
- Compliance with other permits/approvals covered in DEL-32.04, DEL-32.05, DEL-32.06

## Construction

**Deliverable Production Context:**

This is a **record deliverable** documenting compliance with VFPA PER approval conditions. Production involves:

1. Extracting PER conditions from VFPA PER approval (DEL-32.02)
2. Establishing compliance tracking system for each condition
3. Executing compliance activities (monitoring, inspections, submittals) during project phases
4. Collecting compliance evidence (reports, test results, certifications, photos, submittals)
5. Compiling and organizing compliance records
6. Submitting required documentation to VFPA per PER conditions

(See Procedure.md for detailed workflow)

**Anticipated artifacts:**
- PER condition compliance documentation (Source: Decomposition Section 5, DEL-32.03)

**Production inputs (upstream):**

- **VFPA PER approval** (DEL-32.02) — contains conditions requiring compliance
- **PER condition assignments** from DEL-32.02 compliance tracking initiation
- **Construction activities** and associated compliance evidence (inspections, tests, monitoring data)
- **Contractor submittals** to VFPA per PER conditions

**Production outputs:**

- **Compliance records** — organized documentation demonstrating PER condition compliance
- **Compliance register** — tracking of condition compliance status
- **VFPA submittals** — reports and documentation submitted to VFPA per conditions

**Record characteristics:**

- **Format:** Varies by condition type — inspection forms, test reports, monitoring data, submittal letters, photos, certifications — **TBD**: Format per PER conditions
- **Organization:** Organized by PER condition number or category — **TBD**: Establish filing structure
- **Accessibility:** Must be readily available for VFPA inspections and audits
- **Retention:** Per VFPA requirements and contract — **TBD**: Retention period
