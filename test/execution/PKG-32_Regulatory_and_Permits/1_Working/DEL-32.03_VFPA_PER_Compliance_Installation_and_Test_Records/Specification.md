### Interface Requirements

**IR-01: DEL-32.02 (Permits)**

- **Coordination:** Log all VFPA interactions
- **Verification:** Procedure.md Step 4

**IR-03: Construction Packages**
- Construction activities generate compliance evidence (inspections, tests, monitoring)
- Construction packages interface with DEL-32.03 for compliance data collection
- **Coordination:** **TBD** — define compliance data flow from construction to QA/QC
- **Verification:** Procedure.md Step 3

### Quality Requirements

**QR-01: Record Quality and Accuracy**
- All compliance records shall be accurate, complete, and legible
