**Key entities:** DFO Fisheries Act Authorization (DEL-32.02), DFO Authorization Conditions, Compliance Records, Compliance Register, DFO Submissions

## Conditions

**Regulatory Context:**
- **Authority:** Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada — Fisheries Act jurisdiction over fish habitat
- **Process:** Fisheries Act authorization for works affecting fish habitat
- **Project scope triggering DFO:** Marine works (wharf modifications, marine loading arm installation, in-water construction) — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on PKG-08, PKG-09, PKG-11
- **Authorization application:** Submitted per DEL-32.01 — **TBD**
- **Authorization issued:** Recorded in DEL-32.02 — **TBD**

**Typical DFO condition categories (anticipated):**
- Fish habitat protection measures (sediment control, turbidity monitoring)
- Timing windows for in-water work (fish migration/spawning windows)
- Marine mammal observation and work cessation protocols
- Offset or compensation measures (if habitat impacts authorized)
- Reporting to DFO (work commencement, completion, monitoring results)

**Scope boundary:** DFO Fisheries Act authorization conditions only; other permits in DEL-32.03, 32.05, 32.06

## Construction

**Production:** Similar to DEL-32.03 but for DFO conditions:
1. Extract DFO authorization conditions from DEL-32.02
2. Establish compliance tracking
3. Execute compliance activities (monitoring, observations, habitat protection measures)
4. Collect evidence (inspection reports, monitoring data, photos, marine mammal observations)
5. Submit reports to DFO per conditions
6. Compile and file compliance records

(See Procedure.md)
