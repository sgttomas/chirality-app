# Guidance: DEL-32.04 DFO Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Supports **DFO Compliance Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-32**.

**Purpose:** Evidence of DFO compliance (Source: _CONTEXT.md)
**Type:** Record | **Discipline:** Project Delivery | **Responsible:** QA/QC
**Objective:** OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance

## Principles

### 1. Condition-Driven Compliance
DFO Fisheries Act authorization conditions define specific requirements for habitat protection and fish welfare during marine works.

### 2. Timing Window Compliance
DFO conditions typically include timing windows (restricted work periods during fish migration/spawning). Non-compliance can result in work stoppage.

### 3. Marine Mammal Protection
DFO conditions typically require marine mammal observation protocols and work cessation if marine mammals observed within specified radius.

## Considerations

### DFO Condition Categories (Typical)
- **Fish habitat protection:** Sediment containment, turbidity monitoring, erosion control
- **Timing windows:** In-water work restrictions during fish migration/spawning periods
- **Marine mammal observation:** Trained observers, work cessation protocols
- **Offset/compensation:** Habitat restoration or offsetting measures (if impacts authorized)
- **Reporting:** Work commencement, completion, monitoring results, incident reporting

### Compliance Phases
- **Pre-construction:** Submit required plans; confirm timing window compliance; train observers
- **During-construction:** Habitat protection measures; marine mammal observations; monitoring; work window compliance
- **Post-construction:** Habitat restoration (if required); final reports

### Interface with DEL-32.02
DFO authorization (DEL-32.02) → Extract conditions → Assign to DEL-32.04 → Track compliance → Demonstrate compliance

## Trade-offs

### Timing Window Flexibility vs Compliance Risk
**Trade-off:** Attempt to work outside timing windows (faster schedule) vs strict compliance with timing windows (reduced risk).
**Recommendation:** Strict timing window compliance; DFO enforcement is rigorous.

## Examples

**Example DFO Condition:**
"No in-water works shall occur between April 1 and August 31 (fish spawning window). If in-water works occur at other times, a qualified marine mammal observer shall be on-site during pile driving. If marine mammals observed within 100m, work shall cease until mammals leave area."

**Compliance demonstration:**
- Schedule in-water works outside April 1–Aug 31 window
- Engage qualified marine mammal observer
- Observer logs maintained for all pile driving days
- If marine mammals observed, record work cessation and resumption
- Submit observer logs and work dates to DFO per reporting conditions
- File all records in DEL-32.04
