# Procedure: DEL-32.06 Code Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Defines process for **Code Compliance Installation & Test Records** within **PKG-32**.

**Purpose:** Demonstrates code condition compliance (Source: _CONTEXT.md; Specification.md)
**Type:** Record | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** NOT_TRACKED
**Upstream:** DEL-32.02 (Permits) — building/fire/code permits and conditions
**Personnel:** QA/QC Manager, construction team, authority inspectors

## Steps

### Step 1: Extract Building/Fire/Code Permit Conditions
(Implements Specification.md FR-01)
- Obtain building, fire, electrical, plumbing, gas permits from DEL-32.02
- Extract all permit conditions (inspection requirements, code compliance requirements, testing requirements)
- Review condition requirements and schedules
- **Output:** List of building/fire/code permit conditions

### Step 2: Establish Compliance Tracking System
(Implements Specification.md FR-02)
- Create compliance register for code permit conditions
- Assign ID, responsible party, compliance method, inspection schedule for each condition
- Classify by code type (building, fire, electrical, plumbing, gas) and inspection stage
- **Output:** Code compliance register

### Step 3: Execute Compliance Activities
(Implements Specification.md FR-03)
- Building code compliance: structural inspections, envelope compliance, accessibility compliance
- Fire code compliance: fire protection system installation and testing, exit compliance, flammable liquid storage compliance
- Electrical code compliance: electrical installations, hazardous area classification compliance
- Plumbing/gas code compliance: system installations
- Collect compliance evidence (inspection readiness, test certificates, photos, as-built drawings)
- **Output:** Compliance evidence

### Step 4: Coordinate and Pass Authority Inspections
(Implements Specification.md FR-04)
- Schedule authority inspections per permit conditions (foundation, framing, rough-in, fire protection, final)
- Coordinate inspection timing with construction schedule
- Ensure inspection readiness before calling inspector
- Pass inspections; obtain inspector sign-offs
- Address any deficiencies identified; re-inspect if needed
- Log inspections in DEL-32.07; file inspection reports in DEL-32.08
- **Output:** Passed authority inspections; inspection reports

### Step 5: Obtain Occupancy Permit and Final Certifications
(Implements Specification.md FR-05)
- Upon completion of all inspections and compliance conditions, apply for occupancy permit
- Obtain occupancy permit from authority
- Obtain any other required final certifications (fire system final acceptance, electrical final, etc.)
- File occupancy permit in DEL-32.02 and DEL-32.06
- Log in DEL-32.07; file in DEL-32.08
- **Output:** Occupancy permit and final certifications

### Step 6: Update Compliance Register
(Implements Specification.md FR-06)
- Update register as activities complete
- Record inspection dates, pass/fail status, deficiencies, re-inspections, final approvals
- **Output:** Current compliance register

### Step 7: Compile and File Compliance Records
(Implements Specification.md FR-07)
- Organize evidence by code type and inspection stage
- File per document control
- Ensure accessibility for authority audits
- **Output:** Organized compliance record set
