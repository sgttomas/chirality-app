# Guidance: DEL-32.08 Authority & Stakeholder Correspondence Copies

## Purpose

Supports **Authority & Stakeholder Correspondence Copies** for **PKG-32**.

**Purpose:** File repository of correspondence (Source: _CONTEXT.md)
**Type:** Document Package | **Discipline:** Project Delivery | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor
**Objective:** OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance (record retention)

## Principles

### 1. Complete Correspondence Archive
All authority and stakeholder correspondence shall be retained for audit, compliance verification, and regulatory requirements.

### 2. Paired with Correspondence Register (DEL-32.07)
Register (DEL-32.07) is the **searchable index**. Copies (DEL-32.08) are the **actual documents**. Together: complete correspondence management.

### 3. Organized and Retrievable
Filing structure must enable efficient retrieval for inspections, audits, and project team reference.

## Considerations

### Filing Structure
(See Datasheet Construction for example folder structure)

**Organization by authority/stakeholder:** VFPA, DFO, Transport Canada, Building Authority, Fire Authority, Employer, Other Stakeholders

**Chronological within each folder:** Files sorted by date for easy navigation

**Consistent file naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD_Description_Reference.pdf` — includes date, description, and DEL-32.07 register reference — **TBD**: Establish naming convention

### Correspondence Types Filed
(See Datasheet Conditions for comprehensive list; see DEL-32.07 for correspondence types logged)

All correspondence logged in DEL-32.07 is also filed in DEL-32.08.

### Interface with DEL-32.07 (Two-Way Linkage)
- **Register entry (DEL-32.07)** includes link/reference to **filed copy (DEL-32.08)**
- **Filed copy file name (DEL-32.08)** includes **register entry reference from DEL-32.07**
- **Benefit:** Register provides searchable index; files provide actual documents for review

### Interface with DEL-32.01 through DEL-32.06
All permit and compliance deliverables reference DEL-32.08 for filing correspondence copies. Consistency with their procedures required.

## Trade-offs

### Electronic vs Hard Copy Filing
**Trade-off:** Electronic files only (efficient, searchable) vs hard copy + electronic (redundancy, some authorities prefer hard copy).
**Recommendation:** Electronic primary with hard copy backups for critical documents (permits, approvals). **TBD**: Establish policy.

### Filing Timing (Real-Time vs Batch)
**Trade-off:** File immediately (most complete) vs batch filing (efficient but risk of missed items).
**Recommendation:** File promptly (daily or within 2 business days) to avoid missed correspondence.

## Examples

**Example Filing:**

**Correspondence:** VFPA PER approval received 2026-05-01

**Actions:**
1. Save VFPA PER approval as PDF
2. File in DEL-32.08: `/DEL-32.08/VFPA/2026-05-01_PER_Approval.pdf`
3. Log in DEL-32.07 register: Entry includes link to `/DEL-32.08/VFPA/2026-05-01_PER_Approval.pdf`
4. File name includes register reference if applicable

**Result:** Correspondence indexed in DEL-32.07 and filed in DEL-32.08; complete audit trail
