# Procedure: DEL-32.08 Authority & Stakeholder Correspondence Copies

## Purpose

Defines process for **maintaining Authority & Stakeholder Correspondence Copies** within **PKG-32**.

**Purpose:** File repository of correspondence (Source: _CONTEXT.md; Specification.md)
**Type:** Document Package (living repository) | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (Project Delivery Lead)

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** NOT_TRACKED
**Upstream:** None (repository established at project start; continuously updated)
**Paired deliverable:** DEL-32.07 (Correspondence Register) — register is index; DEL-32.08 contains copies
**Personnel:** Project Delivery Lead (or designated document controller)

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Filing Structure
(Implements Specification.md FR-01)

**At project start:**
- Create filing structure (folders by authority/stakeholder)
- Folder structure (see Datasheet Construction for example):
  - VFPA, DFO, Transport_Canada, Building_Authority, Fire_Authority, Employer, Other_Stakeholders
- Establish file naming convention (see Specification.md FR-03): `YYYY-MM-DD_Description_Reference.pdf`
- Configure access permissions (read access for project team; write access for Project Delivery Lead)
- **Output:** Operational filing structure

### Step 2: File Correspondence Copies as They Occur
(Implements Specification.md FR-02, FR-03, FR-04)

**For each authority/stakeholder correspondence:**
- Obtain correspondence copy (email, letter, document)
- Convert to PDF if not already PDF
- Name file per naming convention (include date, description, register reference from DEL-32.07)
- File in appropriate authority/stakeholder folder
- Cross-reference to DEL-32.07: ensure register entry links to this file; file name includes register reference
- **Coordinated with DEL-32.07 Procedure Step 2:** Correspondence logging and filing occur together
- **Output:** Correspondence copy filed and cross-referenced

**Correspondence types filed:**
(See Datasheet Conditions for comprehensive list; coordinated with all PKG-32 deliverables)

- Permit applications (DEL-32.01 Procedure Steps 5.6, 6.2)
- Issued permits (DEL-32.02 Procedure Step 3.4)
- VFPA submittals and correspondence (DEL-32.03 Procedure Step 4)
- DFO submittals and correspondence (DEL-32.04 Procedure Step 4)
- Transport Canada submittals and correspondence (DEL-32.05 Procedure Step 4)
- Building/fire/code inspection reports (DEL-32.06 Procedure Steps 4, 5)
- All other authority/stakeholder correspondence

**Timing:** File promptly (target: within 2 business days of occurrence) per Specification.md PR-01

### Step 3: Maintain File Accessibility
(Implements Specification.md FR-05)

- Ensure files are accessible to project team members requiring correspondence visibility
- File location: **TBD** — project shared drive or document management system (DMS)
- Provide read access to team; restrict write access to Project Delivery Lead
- **Output:** Files accessible to project team

### Step 4: Archive and Retain Files
(Implements Specification.md FR-06)

**At project closeout:**
- Finalize filing (ensure all correspondence filed)
- Archive files per contract and regulatory retention requirements
- Retention period: **TBD** — typically project duration + post-construction period + X years
- Archive format: **TBD** — electronic archive or hard copy archive
- **Output:** Archived correspondence files; retention compliant

## Verification

| Activity | Acceptance Criteria | Procedure Ref |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Filing structure established | Folders operational | Step 1 |
| Correspondence filed | All correspondence filed per PR-02 (100% filed) | Step 2 |
| File naming consistent | Consistent naming per FR-03 | Step 2 |
| Cross-references maintained | All copies link to DEL-32.07 register (per IR-01) | Step 2 |
| Files accessible | Team can access files (per FR-05) | Step 3 |
| Files archived/retained | Retention compliant (per FR-06) | Step 4 |

**Verification methods:**
- **Cross-check with DEL-32.07:** All register entries have filed copies; all filed copies have register entries (Specification.md IR-01, PR-02)
- **Spot checks:** QA/QC Manager conducts periodic spot checks (sample correspondence; verify filed in DEL-32.08 and logged in DEL-32.07)
- **Audit review:** Files available for authority audits

## Records

**Outputs:** Email/letter copies, submissions, approvals, meeting minutes (Source: Decomposition Section 5)

**Format:** **TBD** — Electronic files (PDFs) in folder structure; or document management system (DMS)

**Filing structure:** By authority/stakeholder; chronological within each folder (see Datasheet Construction for example structure)

**Storage location:** **TBD** — project shared drive or DMS

**Retention:** **TBD** — Per contract and regulatory requirements (typically project duration + post-construction period + X years)

**Interface with related deliverables:**
- **DEL-32.07 (Correspondence Register):** Paired deliverable: register (DEL-32.07) is index; copies (DEL-32.08) are documents (Specification.md IR-01)
- **DEL-32.01 through DEL-32.06:** These deliverables generate correspondence filed in DEL-32.08 (per their procedures; Specification.md IR-02)
