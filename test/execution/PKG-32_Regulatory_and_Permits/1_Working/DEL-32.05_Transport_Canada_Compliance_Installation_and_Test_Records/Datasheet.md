**Source:** _CONTEXT.md; Decomposition Section 5; **ASSUMPTION** labels as noted

**Key entities:** Transport Canada Approvals (DEL-32.02), Transport Canada Approval Conditions, Compliance Records, Compliance Register, Transport Canada Submissions

## Conditions

**Regulatory Context:**
- **Authority:** Transport Canada — federal authority for rail and marine transportation safety
- **Jurisdictions:** Rail Safety (railcar unloading operations); Marine Safety (ship loading, marine interface)
- **Project scope triggering Transport Canada:** Railcar unloading facility (PKG-10), marine loading system (PKG-11), rail-marine interface — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on project scope
- **Approvals application:** Submitted per DEL-32.01 — **TBD**
- **Approvals issued:** Recorded in DEL-32.02 — **TBD**

**Typical Transport Canada condition categories (anticipated):**
- Rail safety compliance (railcar unloading operations, rail spur safety, signaling)
- Marine safety compliance (loading arm operations, vessel interface, marine safety equipment)
- Notifications to Transport Canada (work commencement, incidents, operational changes)
- Inspections and certifications (rail infrastructure, marine equipment)
- Reporting requirements

**Scope boundary:** Transport Canada approval conditions only; other permits in DEL-32.03, 32.04, 32.06

## Construction

**Production:** Similar to DEL-32.03 and DEL-32.04:
1. Extract Transport Canada approval conditions from DEL-32.02
2. Establish compliance tracking
3. Execute compliance activities (rail/marine inspections, notifications, safety measures)
4. Collect evidence (inspection reports, certifications, photos, incident logs)
5. Submit notifications/reports to Transport Canada per conditions
6. Compile and file compliance records

(See Procedure.md)
