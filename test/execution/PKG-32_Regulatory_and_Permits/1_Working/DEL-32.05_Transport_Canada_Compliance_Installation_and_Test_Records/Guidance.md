# Guidance: DEL-32.05 Transport Canada Compliance Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Supports **Transport Canada Compliance Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-32**.

**Purpose:** Evidence of Transport Canada compliance (Source: _CONTEXT.md)
**Type:** Record | **Discipline:** Project Delivery | **Responsible:** QA/QC
**Objective:** OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance

## Principles

### 1. Dual Jurisdiction Compliance (Rail and Marine)
Transport Canada has authority over both rail safety (railcar unloading operations) and marine safety (vessel loading operations). Compliance requirements span both jurisdictions.

### 2. Safety-Critical Requirements
Transport Canada conditions focus on transportation safety. Non-compliance can result in operational restrictions or safety orders.

### 3. Notification and Inspection Requirements
Transport Canada typically requires notifications (work commencement, operational changes, incidents) and periodic inspections.

## Considerations

### Transport Canada Condition Categories (Typical)
- **Rail safety:** Railcar unloading operations, rail spur infrastructure, signaling systems, emergency response
- **Marine safety:** Loading arm operations, vessel interface, marine safety equipment, emergency shutdown systems
- **Notifications:** Work commencement, operational commencement, incident reporting
- **Inspections:** Rail infrastructure inspections, marine equipment certifications
- **Reporting:** Operational reports, incident reports

### Compliance Phases
- **Pre-construction/Pre-operational:** Notifications to Transport Canada; design reviews; inspector liaison
- **During-construction:** Construction inspections; equipment installation compliance
- **Pre-operational:** Commissioning inspections; operational readiness verification
- **Operational:** Ongoing compliance (operational inspections, incident reporting, periodic certifications)

### Interface with DEL-32.02
Transport Canada approvals (DEL-32.02) → Extract conditions → Assign to DEL-32.05 → Track compliance → Demonstrate compliance

## Trade-offs

### Proactive Transport Canada Liaison vs Reactive Compliance
**Trade-off:** Proactive engagement with Transport Canada inspectors (better relationship, early issue identification) vs reactive compliance (minimum interaction, potential for surprises).
**Recommendation:** Proactive liaison; Transport Canada has enforcement authority and early engagement reduces compliance risk.

## Examples

**Example Transport Canada Condition (Rail Safety):**
"Prior to commencement of railcar unloading operations, the Contractor shall notify Transport Canada and arrange for a rail safety inspection of the unloading facility. Operations shall not commence until Transport Canada confirms compliance with rail safety regulations."

**Compliance demonstration:**
- Notify Transport Canada of operational readiness
- Coordinate inspection with Transport Canada rail safety inspector
- Address any deficiencies identified during inspection
- Obtain Transport Canada confirmation of compliance
- File notification, inspection report, and confirmation in DEL-32.05
- Log in DEL-32.07; file in DEL-32.08
