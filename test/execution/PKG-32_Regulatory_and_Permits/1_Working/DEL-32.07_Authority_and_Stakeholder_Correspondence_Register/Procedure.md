# Procedure: DEL-32.07 Authority & Stakeholder Correspondence Register

## Purpose

Defines process for **maintaining Authority & Stakeholder Correspondence Register** within **PKG-32**.

**Purpose:** Tracking log for authority/stakeholder correspondence (Source: _CONTEXT.md; Specification.md)
**Type:** Record (living document) | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (Project Delivery Lead)

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** NOT_TRACKED
**Upstream:** None (register established at project start; continuously updated)
**Personnel:** Project Delivery Lead (or Permit Coordinator), with input from all team members generating authority correspondence

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Correspondence Register
(Implements Specification.md FR-01)

**At project start:**
- Create correspondence register file (spreadsheet or database)
- Define register structure with columns (see Guidance.md — Register Structure for typical columns):
  - Entry Date, Correspondence Date, Authority/Stakeholder, Correspondence Type, Reference Number, Subject, Action Required, Responsible Party, Status, Link to DEL-32.08
- Establish filing system for DEL-32.08 (Correspondence Copies) to enable cross-referencing
- Distribute register access to project team (read access for all; write access for Project Delivery Lead)
- **Output:** Operational correspondence register

### Step 2: Log Correspondence as It Occurs
(Implements Specification.md FR-02, FR-03)

**For each authority/stakeholder correspondence:**
- Create new register entry with all required information (see Guidance.md — Register Structure)
- Correspondence types logged (see Guidance.md — Correspondence Types Logged):
  - Permit applications (DEL-32.01 Procedure Step 5.5)
  - Permit receipts (DEL-32.02 Procedure Steps 2.3, 3.2)
  - Compliance submittals (DEL-32.03-32.06 Procedure Step 4)
  - Authority RFIs and Contractor responses
  - Inspection requests and reports
  - Authority approvals and acknowledgments
  - Meeting minutes
  - Incident notifications
  - Other authority/stakeholder correspondence
- File correspondence copy in DEL-32.08 (see DEL-32.08 Procedure Step 2)
- Update register entry with link/reference to DEL-32.08 copy (cross-reference)
- **Output:** Register entry created and linked to DEL-32.08 copy

**Timing:** Log correspondence promptly (target: within 2 business days of occurrence) per Specification.md PR-01

### Step 3: Maintain and Update Register
(Implements Specification.md FR-04)

**As correspondence progresses:**
- Update register entry status as actions occur:
  - "Submitted" → "Under Review" → "Response Received" → "Closed"
  - or: "Action Required" → "In Progress" → "Completed"
- Update action required, responsible party, deadline as needed
- Add notes/comments for additional context
- **Output:** Current, up-to-date register reflecting latest correspondence status

**Frequency:** Update register as correspondence actions occur (ongoing throughout project)

### Step 4: Maintain Register Accessibility
(Implements Specification.md FR-05)

- Ensure register is accessible to project team members requiring visibility (Project Manager, QA/QC Manager, discipline leads, Permit Coordinator)
- Register location: **TBD** — project shared drive or document management system
- Provide read access to team; restrict write access to Project Delivery Lead (or designated person) to maintain register integrity
- **Output:** Register accessible to project team

### Step 5: Finalize Register at Project Closeout
(Implements Specification.md FR-06)

**At project closeout:**
- Review register for completeness (all correspondence logged)
- Close all open register entries (resolve outstanding actions or document as carried forward to operations)
- Finalize register and file per project closeout procedures
- **Output:** Finalized correspondence register; project closeout documentation

## Verification

| Activity | Acceptance Criteria | Procedure Ref |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Register established | Register operational with defined structure | Step 1 |
| Correspondence logged | All correspondence logged per PR-02 (100% logged) | Step 2 |
| Cross-references maintained | All register entries link to DEL-32.08 copies (per IR-02) | Step 2 |
| Register maintained | Register current and accurate (per FR-04) | Step 3 |
| Register accessible | Team can access register (per FR-05) | Step 4 |
| Register finalized | All correspondence closed at project closeout (per FR-06) | Step 5 |

**Verification methods:**
- **Spot checks:** QA/QC Manager conducts periodic spot checks (sample correspondence; verify logged in register)
- **Cross-check with DEL-32.08:** All DEL-32.08 copies have register entries; all register entries have DEL-32.08 copies (per Specification.md IR-02)
- **Audit review:** Register available for authority audits and compliance reviews

## Records

**Outputs:** Correspondence log, meeting minutes register, RFI register (authority-facing) (Source: Decomposition Section 5)

**Format:** **TBD** — Typically spreadsheet (Excel) or database system

**Storage:** Project shared drive or document management system — **TBD**

**Retention:** **TBD** — Per contract requirements (typically project duration + post-construction period + X years)

**Interface with related deliverables:**
- **DEL-32.01 through DEL-32.06:** These deliverables generate correspondence that is logged in DEL-32.07 (per their procedures)
- **DEL-32.08 (Correspondence Copies):** Register entries (DEL-32.07) link to correspondence copies (DEL-32.08); paired deliverables
