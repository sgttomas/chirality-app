## Construction

**Register Production:**

This is a **living document** (continuously updated throughout project):

1. Establish register structure and filing system at project start
2. Log each authority/stakeholder correspondence as it occurs
3. Update register entries as correspondence progresses (e.g., RFI issued → response submitted → acknowledgment received)
4. Cross-reference each register entry to correspondence copy in DEL-32.08
5. Maintain register throughout project; finalize at project closeout

(See Procedure.md)

**Anticipated artifacts:** Correspondence log, meeting minutes register, RFI register (authority-facing) (Source: Decomposition Section 5)
