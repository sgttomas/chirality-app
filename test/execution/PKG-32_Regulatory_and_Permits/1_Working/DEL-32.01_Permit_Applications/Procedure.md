- Contact information (applicant and project contact)
- (See Guidance.md Section "Examples — Document Structure Example" item 1)
- **Output:** Draft cover letter

**2.5. Assemble Application Package**

Organize application package in logical order (typically: cover letter, application form, project description, drawings, specifications/reports/calculations, fee payment). Number pages and include a table of contents if package is large.
- (See Datasheet.md Construction — document structure; see Guidance.md Section "Examples — Document Structure Example")
- **Output:** Draft permit application package (cover letter, completed application form, supporting documentation)

**Verification:** Completeness check against authority application checklist. (See Specification.md Verification table; implements Specification.md PR-01)

---

### Step 3: Internal Review

**Objective:** Ensure permit application is technically accurate, complete, and compliant with authority requirements before submission.

(Implements Specification.md QR-02 and QR-03; see Guidance.md Section "Principles" #3 — Completeness and Accuracy; see Guidance.md Section "Trade-offs — Completeness vs Schedule Pressure"; see Datasheet.md Attributes — "Internal Review Process" entity)

Verify whether Employer review/approval is required per contract and ERs. **TBD** — confirm requirement from ERs (Decomposition Section 3 — location TBD).

**4.2. Submit to Employer**

If Employer review is required, submit application package to Employer per contract submittal procedures. Include cover letter explaining submission purpose and requesting Employer approval to proceed with authority submission. **TBD** — define Employer submittal procedure and timeline.
- **Rationale:** Guidance.md Section "Principles" #6 — Employer may require review/approval before authority submission; this review step must be planned into schedule
- **Output:** Application package submitted to Employer

**4.3. Address Employer Comments**

Review Employer comments and questions. Update application package as needed.
- **Output:** Employer comments addressed; revised application package

**4.4. Obtain Employer Approval**

**Activities:**

**6.1. Track Application Status**

Monitor application status in permit register and correspondence register (DEL-32.07). Update status as application progresses through authority review (e.g., "Submitted," "Under Review," "RFI Issued," "Approved," "Permit Issued").
- **Implements:** Specification.md FR-06 and IR-04
- (See Datasheet.md Attributes — "Permit Register" and "Application Tracking" entities)
- **Output:** Updated permit register and correspondence register with current status

**6.2. Respond to Authority Requests**

If authority issues request for information (RFI) or requests additional documentation:
- Review authority request and determine required response
- Coordinate with discipline leads to prepare response or additional documentation (Specification.md IR-01)
- Submit response to authority per authority's instructions
- Record response in correspondence register (DEL-32.07) — implements Specification.md IR-04
- File copy in correspondence copies (DEL-32.08) — see Datasheet.md References

- **Output:** Response to authority RFI; correspondence register and copies updated

**6.3. Follow Up on Approvals**

If approval timeline is approaching or exceeding anticipated duration, follow up with authority to confirm status and anticipated approval date.
- **Rationale:** Guidance.md Section "Considerations — Schedule and Critical Path" — permit approval timelines vary; long-lead permits require active tracking
- **Output:** Authority status update

**6.4. Receive Issued Permit**

When authority issues permit:
- Confirm receipt of permit document
- Review permit conditions and ensure understanding of compliance requirements
- **Record issued permit in DEL-32.02 (Permits deliverable)** — implements Specification.md IR-03 — see Datasheet.md References — related deliverables
- Update permit register and correspondence register (DEL-32.07) to reflect "Permit Issued" status — implements Specification.md IR-04
- File copy of issued permit in DEL-32.08 (Correspondence Copies)
- Distribute permit to project team (project manager, discipline leads, construction team as applicable)
- **Initiate permit condition compliance tracking** (see DEL-32.03 through DEL-32.06 for compliance records) — see Datasheet.md References — related deliverables; see Guidance.md Section "Considerations — Coordination with Related Deliverables"
- **Output:** Issued permit received, recorded, and distributed; compliance tracking initiated

**Outputs:**
