- **Discipline:** Project Delivery
- **Responsible party:** D&B Contractor
- (Source: _CONTEXT.md; Decomposition Section 5; Datasheet.md Identification)

**Objective alignment:** This deliverable supports **OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance** — "The Works comply with all permits, codes, and authority requirements." (Source: Decomposition Section 6; Datasheet.md Conditions)

## Principles

**Regulatory compliance framework:**

The preparation and submission of permit applications is a critical path activity in design-build project delivery. The following principles govern permit application development and provide rationale for the requirements in Specification.md:

### 1. Early Identification and Planning (supports Specification.md FR-01)

Identify all required permits early in the design phase to avoid schedule delays. Regulatory approval timelines can be lengthy (weeks to months) and must be factored into the project schedule.

**Key activities:**
- Develop permit register (see Datasheet.md Attributes — "Permit Register" entity)
- Develop permit acquisition schedule integrated into project schedule (see Datasheet.md Attributes — "Permit Acquisition Schedule" entity)
- See Procedure.md Step 1 for detailed permit identification and planning process

### 2. Scope Boundary Clarity (supports Specification.md IR-02)

The Contractor is responsible only for **Contractor-responsible permits**. Employer-responsible permits (e.g., certain land use or environmental permits obtained prior to contract award) are excluded from this deliverable scope. (Source: Decomposition Section 1.2; Datasheet.md Conditions — scope boundary)

**Interface coordination required:**
- Clarify which permits are Contractor vs Employer responsibility (see Procedure.md Step 1.5)
- Define interface protocol for coordination on Employer-responsible permits (**TBD**)
- See "Considerations — Employer-Contractor Interface" below for detailed interface considerations

### 3. Completeness and Accuracy (supports Specification.md PR-01, QR-02, QR-03)

Incomplete or inaccurate applications result in authority requests for information (RFIs) and resubmissions, which delay permit issuance and impact project schedule. Applications should be thoroughly reviewed for completeness before submission.

**Quality assurance activities:**
- Technical accuracy review (see Procedure.md Step 3.1; Specification.md QR-02)
- Completeness check against authority requirements (see Procedure.md Step 3.2)
- Regulatory compliance check (see Procedure.md Step 3.3; Specification.md QR-03)
- See "Trade-offs — Completeness vs Schedule Pressure" below for guidance on balancing thoroughness and schedule

### 4. Authority-Specific Requirements (supports Specification.md FR-02)

Each regulatory authority has its own application forms, supporting documentation requirements, review processes, and approval timelines. Applications must be tailored to the specific authority's requirements.

**Key authorities for this project:**
- See Datasheet.md Conditions — "Key regulatory authorities (anticipated)"
- See "Considerations — Regulatory Authority Identification" below for detailed authority descriptions
- See Specification.md Section "Standards — Regulatory and Jurisdictional Requirements" for authority requirements
- See Procedure.md Step 1.3 for authority identification process and Step 2.1 for obtaining authority application forms

### 5. Integrated Design Basis (supports Specification.md FR-03, IR-01)

Permit applications rely on design information from multiple discipline packages (civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, environmental, etc.). The design must be sufficiently mature before applications can be prepared.

**Design coordination:**
- Interface with discipline packages PKG-01 through PKG-31 (see Specification.md IR-01; Datasheet.md Construction — production inputs)
- See "Considerations — Design Maturity Requirements" below for design maturity guidance
- See "Trade-offs — Application Timing vs Design Maturity" below for guidance on when to submit applications
- See Procedure.md Step 2.2 for design information compilation process

### 6. Employer Coordination (supports Specification.md FR-04)

Depending on contract requirements, the Employer may require review/approval of permit applications before they are submitted to regulatory authorities. This review step must be planned into the schedule. **TBD** — confirm Employer review requirements from contract/ERs.

**Coordination activities:**
- Confirm Employer review requirements (see Procedure.md Step 4.1)
- Allow adequate time for Employer review in permit acquisition schedule
- See "Considerations — Employer-Contractor Interface" below for interface considerations
- See Procedure.md Step 4 for Employer review process

### 7. Tracking and Follow-Up (supports Specification.md FR-06, IR-04)

Permit application status must be actively tracked (see DEL-32.07 Correspondence Register) to ensure timely follow-up on authority requests and approvals.

**Tracking activities:**
- Log application submissions in correspondence register DEL-32.07 (see Specification.md IR-04; Procedure.md Step 5.5)
- Monitor application status and respond to authority RFIs (see Procedure.md Step 6)
- Record issued permits in DEL-32.02 (see Specification.md IR-03; Procedure.md Step 6.4)
- See Datasheet.md Attributes — "Application Tracking" entity

**Applicable standards and requirements:**

- **Employer's Requirements** (Volume 2 Parts 1–3) — **location TBD** (Source: Decomposition Section 3; Datasheet.md References; Specification.md Section "Standards — Project-Specific Requirements")
- **Authority-specific permit application requirements** — **TBD** (VFPA, DFO, Transport Canada, City of Surrey, provincial/federal environmental authorities, WorkSafeBC, etc.) (see Specification.md Section "Standards — Regulatory and Jurisdictional Requirements")
- **ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management Systems)** — **ASSUMPTION**: Applicable to project delivery document control and quality processes (see Datasheet.md References; Specification.md Section "Standards — Project Delivery and Quality Management")

## Considerations

**Factors to consider during permit application preparation:**

### Regulatory Authority Identification

**Key authorities (anticipated for this project):**

(See Datasheet.md Conditions — "Key regulatory authorities (anticipated)"; see Specification.md Section "Standards — Regulatory and Jurisdictional Requirements"; see Procedure.md Step 1.3 for authority identification process)

- **Vancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA)** — port/marine jurisdiction, Project and Environmental Review (PER) process — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on terminal location at Fraser Surrey Terminal
- **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** — Fisheries Act authorization for marine works (wharf, marine loading arm) — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on marine loading arm and wharf scope (PKG-08, PKG-09, PKG-11)
- **Transport Canada** — rail and marine interface approvals — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on railcar unloading (PKG-10) and ship loading (PKG-11) scope
- **City of Surrey / Fraser Valley Regional District** — building permits, development permits — **TBD**: Confirm local jurisdiction
- **Provincial authorities** — environmental discharge permits, contaminated sites (if applicable) — **TBD**
- **WorkSafeBC** — occupational health and safety notifications/approvals — **TBD**
- **Fire authority** — fire protection system approvals — **TBD** (Surrey Fire Service or applicable authority)

**Authority determination factors:**
- Project location (port lands vs municipal lands)
- Scope of work (marine works, rail works, building construction, environmental discharges)
- Facility classification (bulk liquid storage, flammable/combustible liquids — CSD canola oil) (Source: Datasheet.md Conditions)
- Environmental sensitivities (fish habitat, contaminated sites, etc.)

### Design Maturity Requirements

Different permit applications require different levels of design maturity:

(Supports Specification.md IR-01 — discipline design package interface; see Datasheet.md Construction — production inputs; see Specification.md FR-03 — supporting documentation)

- **Early permits** (e.g., VFPA PER, DFO authorization) may be based on preliminary design (30%–60% design maturity) but require sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with environmental and safety requirements
- **Construction permits** (e.g., building permits) require detailed design drawings and specifications (90%–IFC design maturity)
- **Operational permits** (e.g., environmental discharge permits) require process descriptions and equipment specifications (60%–90% design maturity)

**Consideration:** Coordinate permit application timing with design development milestones (30%, 60%, 90%, IFC) to ensure adequate design maturity. **TBD** — map permit applications to design milestones.

**Process:** See Procedure.md Step 2.2 for design information compilation; coordinate with discipline package leads to confirm design maturity before compiling supporting documentation.

### Supporting Documentation Requirements

Typical supporting documentation for permit applications:

(Supports Specification.md FR-03 — supporting documentation; see Datasheet.md Construction — document structure; see Procedure.md Step 2.2 for compilation process)

- **Drawings:** Site plans, civil drawings, structural drawings, P&IDs, electrical one-lines, fire protection plans, environmental control plans
  - Source: Discipline packages PKG-01 through PKG-31 (see Specification.md IR-01; Datasheet.md References)
  - **TBD** — map specific drawings to each permit type
- **Specifications:** Technical specifications for equipment, materials, and construction methods
  - Source: Discipline packages PKG-01 through PKG-31
  - **TBD** — map specific specifications to each permit type
- **Calculations:** Structural calculations, fire protection calculations, environmental discharge calculations, etc.
  - Source: Discipline packages PKG-01 through PKG-31
  - **TBD** — map specific calculations to each permit type
- **Reports:** Geotechnical reports (PKG-02, PKG-03), environmental assessments, hazard assessments, noise/air quality studies (as applicable)
  - **TBD** — identify sources and confirm requirements per permit type
- **Operational information:** Process descriptions, operating procedures, emergency response plans (as applicable)
  - **TBD** — identify sources and confirm requirements per permit type

**Consideration:** Identify required supporting documents early and coordinate with discipline package leads to ensure timely availability.

### Employer-Contractor Interface

**Scope boundary (critical):**

(Supports Specification.md IR-02 — Employer-responsible permits interface; see Datasheet.md Conditions — scope boundary; see Principle #2 above)

- **Contractor-responsible permits:** Permits for construction and operation of the Works as defined in the contract scope
- **Employer-responsible permits:** Certain permits obtained by Employer prior to contract award or outside Contractor's scope (Source: Decomposition Section 1.2)

**Interface considerations:**
- Clarify which permits are Contractor vs Employer responsibility — **TBD** (refer to Employer's Requirements — location TBD)
- Coordinate with Employer regarding permit conditions and compliance requirements (see DEL-32.03 through DEL-32.06 for compliance records)
- Confirm Employer review/approval requirements for Contractor permit applications prior to authority submission — **TBD** (see Specification.md FR-04; Principle #6 above)

**Process:** See Procedure.md Step 1.5 (Clarify Scope Boundary) and Step 4 (Employer Review)

### Schedule and Critical Path

Permit approval timelines vary widely:

(Supports Specification.md PR-02 — schedule compliance; see Datasheet.md Attributes — "Permit Acquisition Schedule" entity)

- **Fast-track permits:** 2–4 weeks (e.g., some local building permits)
- **Standard permits:** 4–12 weeks (e.g., environmental discharge permits)
- **Complex permits:** 3–12+ months (e.g., VFPA PER, DFO Fisheries Act authorization)

**Consideration:** Identify long-lead permits early and submit applications as soon as design maturity allows (see "Trade-offs — Application Timing vs Design Maturity" below). Monitor application status (see Procedure.md Step 6) and follow up on authority requests promptly. Plan construction sequencing to accommodate permit approval timelines.

**Process:** See Procedure.md Step 1.7 (Develop Permit Acquisition Schedule) for schedule development and integration into project schedule.

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

### Application Timing vs Design Maturity

(Relates to Specification.md IR-01 and Principle #5 — Integrated Design Basis)

**Trade-off:** Submit applications early (based on preliminary design) to start regulatory review, vs wait for detailed design to minimize changes and resubmissions.

**Considerations:**
- **Early submission** reduces schedule risk (starts regulatory clock sooner) but increases risk of design changes requiring application amendments or resubmissions
- **Late submission** reduces amendment risk but delays regulatory review start and may impact construction schedule
- Authority tolerance for design changes during review varies (some authorities require substantially complete design; others accommodate design evolution)

**Guidance:**
- Identify minimum design maturity required by each authority (see "Considerations — Design Maturity Requirements" above)
- Submit as soon as that threshold is met
- Monitor design changes during authority review and coordinate with authority on amendment requirements
- **TBD** — establish project-specific policy on application timing and design maturity thresholds per permit type

**Implementation:** See Procedure.md Step 2.2 for design information compilation and coordination with discipline package leads.

### Completeness vs Schedule Pressure

(Relates to Specification.md PR-01 and Principle #3 — Completeness and Accuracy)

**Trade-off:** Submit complete, thoroughly reviewed applications (slower but reduces RFI risk), vs expedited submissions to meet schedule milestones (faster but may result in RFIs).

**Considerations:**
- **Incomplete applications** result in authority RFIs, which delay approval and consume resources (net schedule impact may be negative)
- **Thorough internal review** before submission reduces authority RFI risk (time invested in review typically pays off in reduced RFI cycles and faster overall approval)
- **Schedule pressure** may tempt expedited submissions without adequate review (short-term schedule gain may result in long-term schedule loss)

**Guidance:**
- Allocate adequate time for internal review (see Procedure.md Step 3 — Technical Accuracy Review, Completeness Check, Regulatory Compliance Check) and Employer review if required (see Procedure.md Step 4)
- Resist temptation to skip review steps under schedule pressure
- If schedule pressure is unavoidable, prioritize completeness check and regulatory compliance check (authority will definitely catch these issues); technical accuracy review can be streamlined if design is mature and stable
- **TBD** — establish internal review timeline per project schedule and permit acquisition schedule

**Implementation:** See Procedure.md Step 3 for internal review process; see Specification.md QR-02 and QR-03 for quality requirements.

### Standardization vs Authority-Specific Customization

**Trade-off:** Use standardized application templates/content across multiple authorities (efficient), vs customize each application to the specific authority's requirements and preferences (more responsive but more effort).

**Considerations:**
- **Standardized core content** (site plans, project description, technical specifications) can be reused across multiple applications (efficient)
- **Authority-specific forms and cover letters** must be customized (not standardized)
- **Authority preferences** — some authorities have specific formatting, terminology, or content preferences that go beyond minimum requirements; customizing to these preferences may improve review experience and reduce RFI risk

**Guidance:**
- Develop a core set of supporting documents (drawings, specifications, reports) that can be reused across applications (see "Considerations — Supporting Documentation Requirements")
- Tailor cover letters and application forms to each authority's specific requirements (see Procedure.md Steps 2.3 and 2.4)
- Review authority guidance documents for preferences and best practices (see Procedure.md Step 2.1)
- Adjust supporting documentation selection and presentation to match each authority's specific requirements and review focus
- **TBD** — develop application document management strategy (standardized core + authority-specific customization)

**Implementation:** See Procedure.md Step 2 for application preparation process.
