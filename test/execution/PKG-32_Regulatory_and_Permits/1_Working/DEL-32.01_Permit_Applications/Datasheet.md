**Key regulatory authorities (anticipated):**

See Guidance.md Section "Considerations — Regulatory Authority Identification" and Specification.md Section "Standards" for detailed authority list.

- **Vancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA)** — port/marine jurisdiction, Project and Environmental Review (PER) — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on terminal location
- **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** — Fisheries Act authorization for marine works — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on marine loading scope
- **Transport Canada** — rail and marine interface approvals — **ASSUMPTION**: Based on railcar unloading and ship loading scope
- **City of Surrey / Fraser Valley Regional District** — building and development permits — **TBD**: Confirm local jurisdiction
- **Provincial environmental authorities** — environmental discharge permits — **TBD**
- **WorkSafeBC** — occupational health and safety notifications/approvals — **TBD**
- **Fire authority** — fire protection system approvals — **TBD**

**Scope boundary (critical):**

- **Contractor-responsible permits only** — This deliverable covers permit applications for Contractor scope of work as defined in the design-build contract
- **Employer-responsible permits excluded** — Certain permits obtained by Employer prior to contract award or outside Contractor's scope are not included in this deliverable (Source: Decomposition Section 1.2 — "Employer-responsible items (permits obtained by Employer...)")
- **Interface protocol:** **TBD** — Define coordination requirements with Employer regarding Employer-responsible permits (see Specification.md IR-02)

## Construction

**Deliverable Production Context:**

This is a **document deliverable** (not a physical construction item). The "construction" of this deliverable involves preparing, reviewing, and submitting permit applications to regulatory authorities. See Procedure.md for detailed production workflow.

**Anticipated artifacts:**
- Contractor permit applications (Source: Decomposition Section 5, DEL-32.01 row)

**Production inputs (required):**

See Procedure.md Section "Prerequisites" for complete input list. Key inputs include:

- **Employer's Requirements Volume 2 Parts 1–3** (Source: Decomposition Section 3) — **location TBD** (not accessible at time of draft) — defines permit requirements and Contractor vs Employer scope boundary
- **Design drawings** from discipline packages (PKG-01 through PKG-31) — site plans, civil, structural, process, electrical, fire protection, environmental control — **TBD**: Map specific drawings to each permit type
- **Technical specifications** from discipline packages — **TBD**: Map specific specifications to each permit type
- **Design calculations** from discipline packages — structural, fire protection, environmental — **TBD**: Map specific calculations to each permit type
- **Geotechnical reports** (PKG-02, PKG-03) — **TBD**: Confirm requirement per permit type
- **Environmental assessments and studies** — **TBD**: Identify source and confirm requirement
- **Hazard assessments** — **TBD**: Identify source and confirm requirement
- **Authority-specific application forms and guidance documents** — **TBD**: Obtain from each applicable authority

**Document structure (anticipated):**

See Guidance.md Section "Examples — Document Structure Example" for typical application package structure. Key components:

- Application cover letters
- Completed authority application forms
- Project description narratives
- Supporting technical drawings
- Supporting technical specifications and calculations
- Supporting reports (geotechnical, environmental, etc.)
- Fee payment records

**Approval and submission workflow:**

See Procedure.md Steps 3–5 for detailed workflow:

1. Internal review (technical accuracy, completeness, regulatory compliance) — Procedure Step 3
2. Employer review/approval (if required by contract) — Procedure Step 4; Specification.md FR-04
3. Authority submission with fees — Procedure Step 5; Specification.md FR-05
4. Tracking and follow-up — Procedure Step 6; Specification.md FR-06
