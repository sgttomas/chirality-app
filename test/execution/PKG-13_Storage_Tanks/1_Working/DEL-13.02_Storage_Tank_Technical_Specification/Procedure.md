## Steps

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Review
**Activities:**
1.1. Review ER for storage tank, agitator, and appurtenance requirements
1.2. Review DEL-13.01 (drawings) and DEL-13.03 (calculations) for design basis
1.3. Review API 650 and applicable standards
1.4. Identify project-specific requirements beyond API 650
1.5. Develop specification outline and section structure

**Outputs:** Requirements register, specification outline

### Step 2: Draft API 650 Tank Specification
**Activities:**
2.1. Prepare sections per Specification.md CR-01 (Scope, References, Definitions, Design Basis, Materials, Design, Fabrication, Welding, Inspection/Testing, Coating, Installation, Documentation)
2.2. Reference API 650 by edition and addenda — **TBD**
2.3. Specify materials per API 650 Table 4-1 and CSA G40.21
2.4. Define fabrication, welding, inspection, testing requirements per API 650 and CSA W59
2.5. Coordinate coating requirements with PKG-26 — **TBD**
2.6. Define documentation requirements (MTRs, WPS/PQR/WPQ, test reports, etc.)

**Outputs:** Draft API 650 Tank Specification

### Step 3: Draft Agitator Specification
**Activities:**
3.1. Prepare sections per Specification.md CR-02 (Performance, Type, Materials, Mounting, Testing, Documentation)
3.2. Define mixing duty and performance requirements — **TBD** (process input or vendor recommendation)
3.3. Specify agitator type, motor/drive requirements — **TBD**
3.4. Specify materials compatible with canola oil
3.5. Define mounting and structural interface with tank (coordinate with DEL-13.01)
3.6. Define FAT and site performance testing requirements

**Outputs:** Draft Agitator Specification

### Step 4: Draft Tank Appurtenance Specification
**Activities:**
4.1. Prepare sections per Specification.md CR-03 (Overflow, Water Draw-off, Nozzles, Manholes, Vents, Instrumentation, Phase 2, Access Equipment)
4.2. Specify overflow protection system — **TBD** (ER extraction)
4.3. Specify water draw-off system
4.4. Specify nozzle materials and requirements (reference DEL-13.01 nozzle schedules)
4.5. Specify manholes, vents per API 650
4.6. Specify instrumentation connections (coordinate with PKG-20)
4.7. Specify Phase 2 connection provisions — **TBD** (ER extraction)
4.8. Specify ladders, platforms, handrails per safety codes

**Outputs:** Draft Tank Appurtenance Specification

### Step 5: Self-Check
**Activities:**
5.1. Review all three specifications for completeness, clarity, and internal consistency
5.2. Verify alignment with DEL-13.01 (drawings) and DEL-13.03 (calculations)
5.3. Verify all ER requirements addressed — **TBD** (compliance matrix)
5.4. Correct any errors or omissions

**Outputs:** Self-checked drafts

### Step 6: Interdisciplinary Review (IDR)
**Activities:**
6.1. Distribute to affected disciplines: Civil/Structural (PKG-05), Process/Piping (PKG-14), I&C (PKG-20), Coatings (PKG-26)
6.2. Receive and log IDR comments
6.3. Resolve comments by revision or coordination
6.4. Obtain IDR sign-offs

**Outputs:** IDR-resolved specifications

### Step 7: Independent Technical Review
**Activities:**
7.1. Independent checker reviews for technical accuracy, standard compliance, completeness
7.2. Checker provides comments
7.3. Resolve comments
7.4. Checker sign-off

**Outputs:** Checked specifications

### Step 8: Discipline Lead Approval
**Activities:**
8.1. Discipline Lead reviews and approves
8.2. Approve for issuance (sign and stamp)

**Outputs:** Approved specifications

### Step 9: Issuance
**Activities:**
9.1. Issue for Review: File in `2_Checking/To/`, track ER/client comments, revise
9.2. Issue for Procurement/Construction: File in `3_Issued/`, distribute

**Outputs:** Issued specification package

### Step 10: Revision Management (as required)
**Activities:**
10.1. Process revision requests per project change control
10.2. Revise specifications with change bars and revision table
10.3. Re-review and re-approve as appropriate
10.4. Re-issue

**Outputs:** Revised specifications

## Verification

Verification per Specification.md Section: Verification (V-01 through V-05)
- Step 5: Self-check
- Step 6: IDR
- Step 7: Independent review
- Step 8: Discipline lead approval
- **TBD:** Employer review (if required)

**Acceptance Criteria:** Per Specification.md AC-01 through AC-05 (Completeness, Accuracy, Consistency, Clarity, Approval)

---

## Records

**Outputs:** Three specification documents (API 650 Tank, Agitator, Tank Appurtenances)
**Process Records:** Self-check, IDR log, review comments, approvals
**Filing:** `2_Checking/` (review) → `3_Issued/` (approved)
