**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.09 (line 695); OBJ-9 (line 67, line 788)

## Principles

### Principle 1: Original Documents
Obtain original vendor-issued warranty certificates—not draft or pro forma documents.

### Principle 2: Timely Collection
Obtain warranty certificates early (before installation/commissioning) to ensure warranty coverage from start.

### Principle 3: Organized and Accessible
Organize certificates for easy retrieval during warranty claim situations.

### Principle 4: Cross-Referenced to Register
Cross-reference certificates to Guarantees & Warranties Register (DEL-31.08) for integrated warranty management.

## Considerations

### Procurement Contract Requirements
Specify warranty certificate delivery requirements in equipment purchase orders.

### Certificate Authenticity
Verify certificates are vendor-issued originals (signed, dated, on vendor letterhead).

### Organization
Organize by equipment or system for easy retrieval.

### Electronic vs. Hard Copy
Electronic format (PDF) preferred for long-term accessibility; hard copy per Employer's requirements.

## Examples
