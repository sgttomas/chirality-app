## Steps

### Step 1: Planning and Scoping

**Activities:**
1.1. Develop Maintenance Manual Outline (identify all equipment, define manual structure)
1.2. Coordinate with Operations Manual team (DEL-31.03) for scope boundaries
1.3. Engage maintenance SMEs and vendor technical representatives
1.4. Develop Production Schedule

**Deliverables:** Maintenance Manual Outline, Production Schedule

### Step 2: Gather Reference Information

**Activities:**
2.1. Obtain As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02)
2.2. Obtain vendor maintenance manuals and spare parts data (DEL-31.05)
2.3. Obtain Asset Hierarchy (DEL-31.06)
2.4. Review warranty requirements (DEL-31.08, DEL-31.09)
2.5. Obtain commissioning baseline data (PKG-30)

**Deliverables:** Reference materials compiled

### Step 3: Develop Manual Content

**Activities:**
3.1. Write equipment descriptions and specifications
3.2. Develop preventive maintenance procedures and schedules
3.3. Develop corrective maintenance procedures
3.4. Develop troubleshooting guides
3.5. Compile spare parts lists
3.6. Integrate safety content (lockout/tagout, hazards, precautions)
3.7. Format and usability check

**Deliverables:** Draft Maintenance Manuals

### Step 4: Field Validation

**Activities:**
4.1. Verify equipment configurations against As-Built Drawings
4.2. Field-validate procedures during commissioning or initial operations (if timing permits)
4.3. Verify spare parts lists against vendor data and equipment installations
4.4. Update manuals based on field validation

**Deliverables:** Field-validated Maintenance Manuals

### Step 5: Technical Review and Validation

**Activities:**
5.1. Technical review by engineers and maintenance SMEs
5.2. HSE review of safety content
5.3. Maintenance personnel review for usability
5.4. Vendor technical review (for critical equipment)
5.5. Comment resolution
5.6. Final approval

**Deliverables:** Reviewed and approved Maintenance Manuals

### Step 6: Completeness Review

**Activities:**
6.1. Completeness verification (all equipment covered, all PM schedules included, all spare parts lists complete)
6.2. Employer acceptance (if required)
6.3. Final QA check

**Deliverables:** Complete Maintenance Manual Set

### Step 7: Issuance and Handover

**Activities:**
7.1. Prepare deliverables (electronic and hard copy)
7.2. Distribution (maintenance shop, supervisor offices, document management system)
7.3. Configuration management (version control, change management process)
7.4. CMMS integration coordination (PM schedules and spare parts data loaded into CMMS)

**Deliverables:** Issued Maintenance Manuals; handover to maintenance team complete

## Verification

1. **Completeness Review** (Step 6.1) — All equipment covered
2. **Technical Review** (Step 5.1) — Accuracy verified
3. **Maintenance Personnel Review** (Step 5.3) — Usability confirmed
4. **HSE Review** (Step 5.2) — Safety content approved
5. **PM Schedule Verification** — Validated against vendor recommendations
6. **Field Validation** (Step 4) — Procedures field-verified

**Acceptance Criteria:** All equipment covered; technical accuracy verified; maintenance personnel confirm usability; Employer acceptance obtained (if required)

## Records

**Outputs:**
1. Equipment Maintenance Manuals (electronic and hard copy)
2. Spare Parts Lists
3. PM Schedule Master List
4. Review and Approval Records

**Management:** Working documents in `1_Working/`; issued manuals in `3_Issued/`; copies in maintenance shop and document management system

**Retention:** For facility operational life
