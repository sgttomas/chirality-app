## Conditions

**Purpose and Context:**

Maintenance Manuals provide comprehensive guidance for maintaining the Canola Oil Transload Facility Phase 1 equipment and systems. They document:
- Equipment descriptions and specifications
- Preventive maintenance procedures and schedules
- Corrective maintenance procedures
- Troubleshooting guides
- Spare parts lists and recommendations
- Safety precautions for maintenance activities
- Maintenance inspection checklists

Maintenance Manuals support:
- OBJ-1 (Safe & Reliable Operation) by ensuring proper equipment maintenance
- OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization) by enabling effective maintenance planning and reducing downtime
- Regulatory compliance for equipment inspections and testing
- Asset integrity and equipment lifecycle management

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per maintenance documentation purpose; OBJ-1 (line 59), OBJ-9 (line 67)

**Relationship to Other Deliverables:**

- Based on As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02) for equipment configurations
- Complements Operation Manuals (DEL-31.03) — maintenance focus vs. operations focus
- References Vendor Documentation (DEL-31.05) for equipment-specific maintenance
- Aligned with Asset Hierarchy (DEL-31.06) for equipment identification
- Supports Guarantees & Warranties (DEL-31.08, DEL-31.09) — warranty compliance maintenance

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per documentation integration; cross-references within PKG-31

## Construction

**Maintenance Manual Set Composition:**

The Maintenance Manuals shall include manuals for all major facility systems, covering:

1. **Equipment-specific maintenance** (pumps, valves, instruments, control systems, electrical equipment, fire protection systems, building MEP)
2. **System-wide maintenance** (piping, tanks, structures, marine systems, pavement)
3. **Preventive Maintenance (PM) schedules** by equipment type and criticality
4. **Spare parts lists** with part numbers, descriptions, recommended quantities

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on facility equipment scope; _CONTEXT.md

**Maintenance Manual Content Structure (typical):**

- Equipment/System Description
- Maintenance Strategy (preventive, predictive, condition-based)
- Preventive Maintenance Procedures and Schedules
- Corrective Maintenance Procedures
- Troubleshooting Guide
- Safety Precautions and Lockout/Tagout Requirements
- Tools and Equipment Required
- Spare Parts Lists
- Vendor Documentation References
- Inspection and Test Checklists

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per typical maintenance manual structure

**Deliverable Format:**

- Electronic format: **TBD** — **ASSUMPTION**: PDF, searchable
- Hard copy format: **TBD** — Printed manuals, binders, or per Employer's requirements
- Accessibility: **ASSUMPTION**: Available in maintenance shop, supervisor offices, and electronic document management system
