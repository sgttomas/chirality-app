# Guidance: DEL-31.02 As-Built Design Drawing Set

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **As-Built Design Drawing Set** for **PKG-31 Documentation & Deliverables**.

**Deliverable Purpose:**
Defines and substantiates as-built drawings in accordance with Employer's Requirements (ER) and VFPA standards, documenting the Canola Oil Transload Facility Phase 1 as actually constructed.

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.02 (line 687); _CONTEXT.md

**Role in Project Lifecycle:**

As-Built Drawings serve as the authoritative record of the constructed facility:
- They document what was actually built, including all field changes and deviations from the original design
- They supersede Record Drawings (DEL-31.01) as the reference for the physical facility
- They form the baseline for operations manuals (DEL-31.03), maintenance manuals (DEL-31.04), and asset management (DEL-31.06)
- They support regulatory closeout, warranty management, and future modifications
- They enable lifecycle cost optimization (OBJ-9) by providing accurate documentation for maintenance planning and future expansions (OBJ-8)

**Distinction from Record Drawings:**
- **Record Drawings (DEL-31.01):** Document the final approved *design intent* as developed by the engineering team
- **As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02):** Document the facility *as actually constructed*, verified against physical field conditions

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per standard engineering documentation practice

This deliverable is classified as a **Drawing Set** under the **Project Delivery** discipline, to be produced by **D&B Contractor**.

## Principles

**Engineering rationale (Project Delivery discipline):**

### Principle 1: Accurate Construction Record

As-Built Drawings must accurately reflect what was built, not what was designed. Key considerations:
- The facility's physical reality takes precedence over design intent
- All field changes, deviations, and as-constructed conditions must be documented
- Field verification (surveys, measurements, inspections) is essential to confirm accuracy
- As-built drawings provide the baseline for all future facility modifications and expansions

**Source:** Specification FR-02 (Field Verification); **ASSUMPTION** per as-built documentation purpose

### Principle 2: Field-Verified Accuracy

As-built drawings are field-verified documents:
- Dimensions, locations, and elevations are confirmed by field survey and measurement
- Visual inspections confirm installed configurations and equipment
- Discrepancies between design and as-built are resolved through field verification, not assumptions
- Field personnel sign-off confirms as-built accuracy

**Source:** Specification FR-02, PR-01; **ASSUMPTION** per surveying and field verification practice

### Principle 3: Configuration Integrity

As-built drawings maintain configuration control throughout the project lifecycle:
- All approved design changes (RFIs, field orders, change notices) are incorporated and traceable
- Change documentation provides audit trail from design through construction to as-built
- Configuration baselines enable future change management and modification tracking
- As-built drawings form the configuration baseline for operations and future phases

**Source:** Specification FR-03, QR-04; **ASSUMPTION** per configuration management best practice

### Principle 4: Standardization and Regulatory Compliance

VFPA drawing standards ensure consistency and regulatory acceptance:
- Standardized symbology, annotations, and formats enable efficient review and use
- Consistent as-built markup conventions (e.g., revision clouds, color coding) distinguish changes from original design
- Adherence to standards facilitates regulatory closeout, handover to Employer, and future reference

**Source:** Specification FR-04, PR-02; Decomposition DEL-31.02 (line 687) — "per VFPA standards"

### Principle 5: Continuity with Design Baseline

As-built drawings build upon Record Drawings as the baseline:
- Record Drawings (DEL-31.01) provide the starting point for as-built production
- Construction markups and changes are overlaid onto the record drawing baseline
- Continuity with design intent is preserved while documenting as-constructed deviations
- This approach minimizes as-built production effort and maintains traceability to original design

**Source:** Specification FR-05, IR-01; Datasheet (Attributes: Baseline)

### Principle 6: Operability and Maintainability Support

As-built drawings are operations and maintenance documents:
- They must be usable by operations personnel for system understanding and troubleshooting
- Equipment access, clearances, and maintenance zones must be clearly shown
- Equipment tags and asset identifiers align with Asset Hierarchy (DEL-31.06) and maintenance management systems
- As-built accuracy directly impacts maintenance efficiency and lifecycle costs (OBJ-9)

## Considerations

**Factors to consider during as-built drawing production:**

### Record Drawing Baseline
- **Obtain Complete Record Drawings:** Ensure Record Drawing Set (DEL-31.01) is complete and issued before commencing as-built production. As-builts cannot be finalized until the record baseline is established.
- **Understand Design Intent:** Review record drawings and design basis documents to understand original design intent. This context helps identify significant deviations during field verification.
- **Source:** Specification IR-01; **ASSUMPTION** per as-built production workflow

### Construction Team Coordination
- **Early Engagement:** Engage construction team early to establish as-built markup procedures and responsibilities.
- **Field Markup Discipline:** Ensure construction field personnel consistently mark up drawings with redlines showing deviations, field changes, and as-constructed conditions.
- **Change Documentation Tracking:** Establish systematic tracking of RFIs, field orders, design changes, and construction change notices. Ensure all approved changes are documented for incorporation into as-builts.
- **Markup Quality Control:** Review field markups for clarity, completeness, and accuracy before transferring to CAD.
- **Source:** Specification IR-02; **ASSUMPTION** per construction documentation practice

### Field Measurement and Verification
- **Survey Plan:** Develop survey and field measurement plan identifying what will be measured, measurement methods, and accuracy requirements.
- **Critical Dimensions:** Prioritize field verification of critical dimensions (e.g., equipment foundations, structural members, pipe routing, clearances).
- **Access and Timing:** Plan field measurement activities to occur when access is available and before areas are closed in or obstructed.
- **Survey Coordination:** Coordinate with project surveyor for control points, benchmarks, and coordinate system consistency.
- **Field Inspection:** Conduct physical inspections to verify configurations that cannot be measured (e.g., buried utilities, concealed systems) against construction records and test documentation.
- **Source:** Specification FR-02, PR-01; **ASSUMPTION** per surveying and field verification practice

### Commissioning Records Cross-Check
- **Test Records:** Cross-check as-built drawings against commissioning test records (PKG-30) to confirm final operating configurations (e.g., valve positions, equipment settings, control logic).

## Trade-offs

**Competing concerns to evaluate:**

### Timing: Continuous vs. Final As-Builts
- **Trade-off:** Produce as-builts continuously during construction vs. produce as-builts after construction completion.
- **Consideration:** Continuous production reduces end-of-project workload and enables early handover of completed systems, but requires ongoing resource commitment and may need rework for late changes. Final production after construction ensures all changes are captured, but concentrates effort at project closeout and may delay handover.
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per as-built production strategy; Specification PR-03

### Detail Level: Full As-Built vs. Markup-Only
- **Trade-off:** Produce fully revised CAD drawings vs. provide marked-up record drawings with field changes annotated.
- **Consideration:** Full CAD revision provides cleaner, more usable drawings but requires significant CAD effort. Marked-up drawings are faster to produce but may be harder to interpret. Employer requirements typically dictate which approach is acceptable.
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per as-built production methods; **TBD** — Employer's Requirements for as-built drawing format

### Accuracy vs. Schedule
- **Trade-off:** Comprehensive field verification vs. expedited as-built production to meet contract closeout schedule.
- **Consideration:** Accurate as-builts require thorough field measurement and verification, which takes time. Schedule pressure may tempt shortcuts, but inaccurate as-builts undermine their purpose and create future risks. Prioritize accuracy for safety-critical and O&M-critical systems.
- **Source:** Specification FR-02, PR-01, PR-03; OBJ-1 (Safe & Reliable Operation)

### Scope: All Changes vs. Significant Changes Only
- **Trade-off:** Document all field deviations vs. document only significant changes exceeding a threshold.
- **Consideration:** Documenting all changes provides complete record but increases effort. Documenting only significant changes reduces effort but may lose information needed for future modifications or troubleshooting. Employer requirements and project change management procedures typically define thresholds.
- **Source:** **ASSUMPTION** per as-built scope definition; **TBD** — change significance thresholds per Employer's Requirements or project procedures

### Cost vs. Lifecycle Value
- **Trade-off:** Minimize as-built production cost vs. invest in comprehensive as-built documentation for lifecycle value.
- **Consideration:** As-built production is a contract closeout cost with no immediate revenue benefit. However, accurate as-builts reduce future maintenance costs, enable efficient modifications, and support OBJ-9 (Lifecycle Cost Optimization). Lifecycle value justifies investment in quality as-builts.
