# Guidance: DEL-31.08 Process Equipment Guarantees & Warranties Register

## Purpose

Centralized tracking of equipment warranties and performance guarantees, enabling effective warranty management and lifecycle cost optimization (OBJ-9).

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.08 (line 694); OBJ-9 (line 67, line 788)

## Principles

### Principle 1: Centralized Warranty Tracking
Single register for all equipment warranties prevents warranty information from being scattered across vendor files.

### Principle 2: Proactive Warranty Management
Register enables proactive warranty expiration monitoring and timely warranty claim initiation.

### Principle 3: Warranty Compliance
Register documents warranty conditions (maintenance requirements, exclusions) ensuring compliance and avoiding warranty voidance.

### Principle 4: Lifecycle Cost Reduction
Effective warranty management reduces lifecycle costs through warranty claims and compliant maintenance.

## Considerations

### Warranty vs. Guarantee
- **Warranty:** Manufacturer's commitment to repair/replace defective equipment within warranty period (typically 1-2 years).
- **Performance Guarantee:** Manufacturer's commitment that equipment meets specified performance parameters (e.g., pump flow rate, efficiency).

Both should be tracked in register.

### Warranty Start Date
Confirm warranty start date (equipment shipment, delivery, installation, commissioning, or substantial completion—varies by vendor).

### Warranty Conditions
Document warranty conditions that could void warranty (e.g., improper maintenance, unauthorized modifications, misuse). Cross-reference to Maintenance Manuals (DEL-31.04) to ensure warranty-compliant maintenance.

### Warranty Claim Process
Establish warranty claim process (identify defect, notify vendor, coordinate repair/replacement, document claim).

### Warranty Expiration Monitoring
Implement warranty expiration monitoring (periodic review, automated reminders) to identify opportunities for pre-expiration repairs or warranty extensions.

### Extended Warranties
Consider procuring extended warranties for critical equipment (cost-benefit analysis).

## Trade-offs

### Register Detail vs. Simplicity
Comprehensive register (all warranty details) vs. simple register (basic info with reference to full warranty documents). Balance based on management needs.

### Maintenance: Internal vs. Vendor
During warranty period, balance internal maintenance (may void warranty) vs. vendor-provided maintenance (maintains warranty, may be costlier).

## Examples
