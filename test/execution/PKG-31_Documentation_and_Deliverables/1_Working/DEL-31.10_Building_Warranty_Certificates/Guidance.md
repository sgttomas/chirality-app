**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.10 (line 696); OBJ-9 (line 67, line 788)

## Principles

### Principle 1: Comprehensive Building Coverage
Obtain warranties for all building systems (structure, envelope, roofing).

### Principle 2: Long-Term Warranties
Building warranties often cover extended periods (10-20 years for roofing, structural warranties for building life)—critical for lifecycle cost management.

### Principle 3: Warranty Compliance
Building warranties often require periodic inspections and maintenance—document requirements to ensure warranty compliance.

## Considerations

### Modular Building Warranties
Modular buildings typically include manufacturer warranty covering structural integrity, weather-tightness, and workmanship.

### Roofing Warranties
Roofing warranties may be material-only or material-and-labor; may be from manufacturer and/or installer. Verify coverage and duration.

### Building Envelope Warranties
Water infiltration warranties for building envelope, windows, doors.

### Warranty Registration
Some building warranties require registration with manufacturer—ensure registration completed.

## Examples

**Roofing Warranty Example:**
"ABC Roofing Company warrants that roofing system installed on Building B-01 is free from defects in materials and workmanship for twenty (20) years from date of substantial completion (June 1, 2026). Warranty covers materials and labor for leak repairs."
