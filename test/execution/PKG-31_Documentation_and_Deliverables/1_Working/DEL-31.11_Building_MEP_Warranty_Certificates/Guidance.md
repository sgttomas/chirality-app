# Guidance: DEL-31.11 Building MEP Warranty Certificates

## Purpose

Collect and organize building MEP warranty certificates, enabling effective warranty management and lifecycle cost optimization (OBJ-9).

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.11 (line 697); OBJ-9 (line 67, line 788)

## Principles

### Principle 1: Comprehensive MEP Coverage
Obtain warranties for all building MEP systems (HVAC, plumbing, fire suppression, electrical).

### Principle 2: Equipment-Specific Warranties
MEP systems often include multiple equipment warranties (e.g., HVAC: rooftop units, air handlers, controls)—ensure all obtained.

### Principle 3: System vs. Equipment Warranties
Distinguish between system warranties (installation workmanship) and equipment warranties (manufacturer defects).

## Considerations

### HVAC System Warranties
- Equipment warranties from HVAC equipment manufacturers (compressors, fans, controls)
- Installation warranty from HVAC contractor
- Extended warranties for critical equipment (consider for lifecycle cost management)

### Fire Suppression System Warranties
- Equipment warranties (sprinkler heads, valves, panels)
- Installation warranty from fire protection contractor
- May require annual inspections to maintain warranty

### Plumbing System Warranties
- Fixture warranties (sinks, toilets, water heaters)
- Installation warranty from plumbing contractor

### Electrical System Warranties
- Electrical equipment warranties (panels, transformers)
- Installation warranty from electrical contractor

### Warranty Conditions
Building MEP warranties often require periodic maintenance (e.g., HVAC filter changes, fire suppression inspections)—document requirements.

## Examples

**HVAC Warranty Example:**
"XYZ HVAC Company warrants HVAC system installation for Building B-01 against defects in workmanship for two (2) years from date of substantial completion. Rooftop unit equipment warranty per manufacturer (separate certificate): five (5) years parts, one (1) year labor."
