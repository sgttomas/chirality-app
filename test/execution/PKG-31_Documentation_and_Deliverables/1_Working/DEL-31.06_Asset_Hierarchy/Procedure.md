# Procedure: DEL-31.06 Asset Hierarchy

## Purpose

To develop and deliver Asset Hierarchy for the Canola Oil Transload Facility Phase 1.

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.06 (line 692)

**Deliverable type:** Document
**Responsible party:** D&B Contractor

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

**Dependency Tracking:** See \`_DEPENDENCIES.md\` — **NOT_TRACKED**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02) — asset identification and tagging baseline
- Equipment lists from discipline packages

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**

### Reference Materials

- As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02)
- Equipment lists and specifications
- Employer's asset management requirements and CMMS specifications — **TBD**

### Personnel Requirements

**Roles:**
- Asset Management Coordinator
- Data management personnel
- Technical reviewers (engineers)
- CMMS specialist (if available)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION**

## Steps

### Step 1: Planning and Standards Development

**Activities:**
1.1. Review Employer's asset management requirements and CMMS specifications
1.2. Develop asset tagging standard (coordinate with Employer's existing standards)
1.3. Define asset hierarchy structure (levels, attributes)
1.4. Define asset criticality classification criteria
1.5. Select format (database, spreadsheet, CMMS-compatible)

**Deliverables:** Asset tagging standard; hierarchy structure defined

### Step 2: Asset Identification and Data Collection

**Activities:**
2.1. Identify all facility assets from As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02) and equipment lists
2.2. Assign asset tags per tagging standard
2.3. Collect asset attributes (description, location, manufacturer, model, installation date, etc.)
2.4. Obtain manufacturer/model information from Vendor Documentation (DEL-31.05)
2.5. Obtain warranty information from Guarantees & Warranties Register (DEL-31.08)

**Deliverables:** Asset list with tags and attributes

### Step 3: Hierarchy Development

**Activities:**
3.1. Organize assets hierarchically (Facility → Systems → Subsystems → Equipment)
3.2. Define parent-child relationships
3.3. Classify asset criticality (critical, important, routine)
3.4. Populate asset hierarchy database/document

**Deliverables:** Asset Hierarchy Database

### Step 4: Data Quality and Consistency Review

**Activities:**
4.1. Review asset data for completeness and accuracy
4.2. Cross-check asset tags against As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02)
4.3. Verify consistency with Operation Manuals (DEL-31.03) and Maintenance Manuals (DEL-31.04)
4.4. Correct errors and resolve inconsistencies

**Deliverables:** Quality-reviewed Asset Hierarchy

### Step 5: CMMS Compatibility Verification

**Activities:**
5.1. Verify Asset Hierarchy format compatible with Employer's CMMS
5.2. Conduct trial data load (if CMMS access available)
5.3. Adjust format as needed

**Deliverables:** CMMS-compatible Asset Hierarchy

### Step 6: Review and Approval

**Activities:**
6.1. Technical review by engineers and asset management personnel
6.2. Employer review and acceptance
6.3. Final approval

**Deliverables:** Approved Asset Hierarchy

### Step 7: Issuance and Handover

**Activities:**
7.1. Issue Asset Hierarchy Database and Document
7.2. Handover to Employer with CMMS data loading support (if required)
7.3. Establish configuration management process for lifecycle updates

**Deliverables:** Issued Asset Hierarchy; handover complete

## Verification

1. **Completeness Review** (Step 4.1) — All assets included
2. **Data Quality Review** (Step 4.1) — Attributes accurate
3. **Tagging Consistency Check** (Step 4.2) — Tags aligned with As-Built Drawings
4. **CMMS Compatibility Check** (Step 5) — Format compatible

**Acceptance Criteria:** All assets included; data accurate; CMMS-compatible; Employer acceptance obtained

## Records

**Outputs:**
1. Asset Hierarchy Database
2. Asset Hierarchy Document/Report
3. Asset Tagging Standard Document

**Management:** \`3_Issued/\`

**Retention:** For facility operational life
