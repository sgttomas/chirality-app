**Role in Project Lifecycle:**

Operation Manuals are critical operational tools that:
- Bridge the gap between design/construction and day-to-day facility operations
- Provide operations personnel with clear, step-by-step procedures for all operating scenarios
- Document the "how to" of facility operations (complementing maintenance manuals which address the "how to maintain")
- Support safe and reliable operations (OBJ-1), operational flexibility (OBJ-4), and lifecycle cost optimization (OBJ-9)
- Enable operator training, competency development, and knowledge retention
- Serve as living documents updated throughout facility operational life

This deliverable is classified as a **Manual** under the **Project Delivery** discipline, to be produced by **D&B Contractor**.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Comprehensive Coverage
Operation Manuals must cover all systems, scenarios, and operating modes. Gaps in coverage create safety risks and operational inefficiency.

### Principle 2: Accuracy and Field Verification
Manuals must accurately reflect the as-built facility. Procedures should be verified during commissioning or initial operations to confirm they work as documented.

**Source:** Specification FR-02; cross-reference DEL-31.02, PKG-30

### Principle 3: Operator-Centered Design
Manuals are tools for operators, not engineers. Write for the user: clear language, logical organization, visual aids, and usability.

**Source:** Specification FR-03

### Principle 4: Safety First
Safety is paramount. Hazards, precautions, and emergency procedures must be prominent and unambiguous. Safety-critical steps clearly marked.

**Source:** Specification FR-04, SR-01; OBJ-1 (line 59)

### Principle 5: Consistency and Integration
Consistent terminology, equipment tags, and nomenclature across all manuals, drawings, and systems. Align with As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02) and Asset Hierarchy (DEL-31.06).

**Source:** Specification PR-02, IR-01, IR-05

### Principle 6: Operational Efficiency and Lifecycle Value
Well-written operation manuals reduce errors, downtime, and training costs. They are lifecycle investments in operational excellence.

**Source:** Specification LR-01; OBJ-9 (line 67)

## Considerations

### As-Built Baseline
- Use As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02) as the configuration baseline for system descriptions and procedures.
- **Source:** Specification IR-01; cross-reference DEL-31.02

### Commissioning Validation
- Incorporate validated operating parameters, setpoints, and procedures from commissioning (PKG-30).
- Field-verify procedures during commissioning or initial operations.
- **Source:** Specification IR-06, FR-02; cross-reference PKG-30

### Operating Modes and Flexibility
- Address all operating modes: rail-to-tank storage, tank-to-ship loading, direct rail-to-ship transfer (OBJ-4).
- Include mode transitions and configuration changes.
- **Source:** Specification FR-05; OBJ-4 (line 62)

### Operations vs. Maintenance Scope
- Clear delineation: Operations focuses on running the facility; Maintenance (DEL-31.04) focuses on upkeep.
- Routine operator tasks (e.g., daily inspections, basic troubleshooting) in Operation Manuals.
- Preventive/corrective maintenance in Maintenance Manuals (DEL-31.04).
- **Source:** Specification IR-02; cross-reference DEL-31.04

### Vendor Documentation Integration
- Reference vendor manuals (DEL-31.05) for equipment-specific details.
- Excerpt or summarize vendor information where appropriate, with clear references.
- **Source:** Specification IR-03; cross-reference DEL-31.05

### Control System Integration
- Describe HMI operation, alarm management, and control logic consistent with Control System Design (DEL-19.01).
- Include HMI screenshots or diagrams.
- **Source:** Specification IR-04; cross-reference DEL-19.01, PKG-19

### Safety and Risk Management
- Hazard identification for each procedure (process hazards, physical hazards, environmental hazards).
- Risk mitigation steps integrated into procedures.
- Prominent cautions and warnings.
- Emergency procedures readily accessible (consider separate quick-reference guides for emergencies).
- **Source:** Specification FR-04, SR-01, SR-03; OBJ-1 (line 59)

### Emergency Procedures
- Comprehensive emergency procedures: emergency shutdown (ESD), spill response, fire response, evacuation, loss of utilities, equipment failure.
- Clear escalation protocols and emergency contacts.
- **Source:** Specification SR-03

### Usability and Readability
- Use plain language, active voice, and imperative mood ("Open valve V-101") for procedures.
- Logical organization: system description → normal operations → abnormal/emergency operations → troubleshooting.
- Visual aids: P&IDs, flowcharts, photographs, diagrams.
- Clear formatting: numbered steps, bullets, tables, caution/warning boxes.
- **Source:** Specification FR-03, PR-01

### Naming Conventions and Asset Tagging
- Equipment tags and identifiers consistent with As-Built Drawings (DEL-31.02) and Asset Hierarchy (DEL-31.06).
- Consistent system names, valve numbering, instrument tags across all documentation.
- **Source:** Specification PR-02, IR-05; cross-reference DEL-31.02, DEL-31.06

### Review and Validation
- Multi-stage review: technical review (engineers), HSE review (safety), operations review (usability).
- Operations personnel involvement is critical—they are the end users.
- **Source:** Specification QR-02

### Training Support
- Operation Manuals support operator training and competency development.
- Consider training-specific versions or training guides derived from operation manuals.
- **Source:** Specification LR-02

### Change Management and Updates
- Establish process for updating manuals based on operational experience, modifications, lessons learned.
- Version control and change tracking per document control procedures.
- **Source:** Specification QR-04, LR-03

## Trade-offs

### Detail Level vs. Usability
- **Trade-off:** Comprehensive detail vs. concise, easy-to-use procedures.
- **Consideration:** Balance is key. Include essential details; reference other sources (drawings, vendor manuals) for deeper information. Prioritize usability for routine procedures.

### Generic vs. Facility-Specific
- **Trade-off:** Generic industry-standard procedures vs. facility-specific, detailed procedures.
- **Consideration:** Facility-specific is better. Tailor procedures to actual facility configuration, equipment, and operating philosophy.

### Single Comprehensive Manual vs. Multiple System Manuals
- **Trade-off:** One large manual covering all systems vs. separate manuals per system.
- **Consideration:** Multiple system manuals are generally more usable (easier to navigate, update, and distribute to relevant personnel). Employer preference and facility complexity dictate.

### Development Timing: Concurrent vs. Post-Commissioning
- **Trade-off:** Develop manuals during design/construction vs. after commissioning.
- **Consideration:** Concurrent development (based on design documents) followed by post-commissioning updates is common. Allows manuals to be ready for training and initial operations, with field verification incorporated after commissioning.

## Examples

**System Description Example:**
"The Railcar Unloading System (PKG-10) transfers canola oil from railcars to storage tanks. The system consists of 32 unloading stations, unloading pumps P-101 A/B/C, unloading headers, and associated piping, valves, and instrumentation. Unloading arms are manually connected to railcar bottom outlets. Product is pumped through the metering system (PKG-12) to storage tanks (PKG-13)."

**Procedure Example (Start-up):**
1. Verify all upstream prerequisites met (tank capacity available, pumps ready, etc.).
2. Open isolation valve V-101 at unloading header.
3. Start unloading pump P-101A.
4. Monitor pump discharge pressure and flow rate on HMI screen.
5. Verify flow to designated storage tank.
6. Monitor tank level and unloading rate.

**Caution Example:**
**CAUTION:** Do not exceed maximum tank fill rate of 500 m³/hr to prevent overfilling and spill risk. Monitor tank level continuously during filling operations.

**Emergency Procedure Example:**
**EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) Procedure:**
1. Press ESD button (located at [locations]).
2. Verify all unloading pumps stopped.
3. Verify all block valves closed.
4. Notify control room and supervisor immediately.
5. Investigate cause before restarting operations.
