# Guidance: DEL-31.05 Vendor Documentation

## Purpose

Collect, organize, and deliver vendor-supplied technical documentation, supporting operations, maintenance, and warranty management.

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-31.05 (line 690)

## Principles

### Principle 1: Comprehensive Collection
Obtain vendor documentation for all major equipment—no gaps. Missing vendor manuals create operational and maintenance risks.

### Principle 2: Quality Control
Review vendor submittals for completeness and quality. Reject incomplete or poor-quality documentation.

### Principle 3: Early Procurement Action
Specify vendor documentation requirements in equipment purchase orders. Request submittals early (before delivery).

### Principle 4: Organized and Accessible
Organize vendor documentation logically (by equipment, system, or vendor) with comprehensive index for easy retrieval.

### Principle 5: Integration with O&M Manuals
Vendor documentation is referenced (not duplicated) in Operation and Maintenance Manuals (DEL-31.03, DEL-31.04).

## Considerations

### Procurement Contract Specifications
Include vendor documentation requirements in equipment purchase specifications:
- Operation and maintenance manuals (electronic and hard copy)
- Material certificates, test certificates, performance certificates
- Warranty documentation
- Spare parts catalogs with part numbers
- Shop drawings (as applicable)
- Language requirements (English, additional languages)

### Submittal Review and Approval
Establish vendor documentation submittal and review process:
- Vendor submits documentation for review
- Project team reviews for completeness and compliance
- Reject/request resubmittal if inadequate
- Approve and file upon acceptance

### Organization and Indexing
Organize vendor documentation packages by equipment or system. Create comprehensive vendor documentation index/register with:
- Equipment tag
- Vendor name
- Document titles
- Document numbers
- Revision/date
- File location (electronic and hard copy)

### Electronic vs. Hard Copy
- Electronic format (PDF, searchable) preferred for long-term accessibility and document management
- Hard copy requirements per Employer's Requirements
- Ensure electronic files are non-proprietary formats

### Warranty Documentation Cross-Reference
Cross-reference vendor warranties to Guarantees & Warranties Register (DEL-31.08) and Warranty Certificates (DEL-31.09).

### As-Supplied Documentation
Verify vendor documentation reflects equipment as-supplied (correct model, serial numbers, configuration, options)—not generic catalog information.

### Spare Parts Management
Vendor spare parts catalogs with part numbers are critical for maintenance planning and procurement.

## Trade-offs

### Timing: Early Submittal vs. As-Supplied Accuracy
Early vendor documentation (based on order) may not reflect as-supplied configuration. Balance early submittal for planning with post-delivery updates for as-supplied accuracy.

### Format: Electronic vs. Hard Copy
Electronic is preferred for accessibility; hard copy may be required by Employer. Plan for both if needed.

### Organization: Equipment-Based vs. Vendor-Based
Equipment-based organization is more user-friendly for operations/maintenance; vendor-based may be simpler administratively. Recommend equipment-based.
