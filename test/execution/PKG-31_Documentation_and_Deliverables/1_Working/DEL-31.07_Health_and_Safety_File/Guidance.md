# Guidance: DEL-31.07 Health & Safety File

## Purpose

Provides comprehensive HSE information supporting safe facility lifecycle (construction, operations, maintenance, modifications), regulatory compliance, and continuous HSE improvement.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Comprehensive HSE Documentation
Health & Safety File is repository of all HSE-relevant information for facility lifecycle.

### Principle 2: Hazard-Based Approach
Focus on hazard identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation documentation.

### Principle 3: Accessibility and Usability
Health & Safety File must be accessible and usable by operations, maintenance, HSE, and emergency response personnel.

### Principle 4: Living Document
Health & Safety File is living document—updated throughout facility lifecycle for modifications, incidents, lessons learned.

### Principle 5: Regulatory Compliance Foundation
Health & Safety File provides documentation demonstrating regulatory compliance.

## Considerations

### Content Development
Compile HSE information from design documentation, HSE plans (PKG-33), operations/maintenance manuals (DEL-31.03, DEL-31.04), commissioning reports, and regulatory submittals.

### Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment
Document facility hazards (process, physical, environmental) and risk assessments conducted during design, construction, and commissioning.

### Emergency Response Integration
Include emergency response plans cross-referenced in Operation Manuals (DEL-31.03).

### Material Safety Data
Include MSDS/SDS for all hazardous materials present at facility (canola oil, cleaning chemicals, lubricants, etc.).

### Regulatory Compliance Documentation
Include permits, approvals, inspection reports, and compliance records.

### Lifecycle Updates
Establish process for updating Health & Safety File for modifications, incidents, near-misses, and continuous improvement.

## Trade-offs

### Comprehensiveness vs. Usability
Very comprehensive file (all HSE information) vs. concise, focused file (essential information). Balance based on Employer's requirements and regulatory expectations.

### Format: Document vs. Database
Document format (PDF) is simpler but harder to update and search. Database format enables updates and searching but requires more setup. Employer preference dictates.

## Examples

**Hazard Documentation Example:**
- Hazard: High-pressure piping rupture
- Risk Assessment: Consequence (major spill, injury); Likelihood (low with proper maintenance)
- Mitigation: Pressure relief valves, rupture disc, pressure monitoring, emergency shutdown system, operator training
