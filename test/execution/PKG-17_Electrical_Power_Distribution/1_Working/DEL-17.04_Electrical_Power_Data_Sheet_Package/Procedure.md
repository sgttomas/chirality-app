# Procedure: DEL-17.04 Electrical Power Data Sheet Package

## Purpose

This procedure defines the process for producing and managing **Electrical Power Data Sheet Package** within **PKG-17 Electrical Power Distribution**.

**Deliverable Purpose**: Defines and substantiates electrical power in accordance with ER requirements.

**Deliverable Type**: Data Sheet
**Responsible Party**: D&B Contractor

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies** (NOT_TRACKED): Equipment procurement in progress; specifications (DEL-17.02) and calculations (DEL-17.03) approved

**Reference Materials**: Equipment specifications (DEL-17.02), design calculations (DEL-17.03), equipment list (DEL-17.01)

**Personnel**: Electrical engineer/designer (data sheet review), procurement team (submittal coordination), P.Eng. (approval)

## Steps

### Step 1: Equipment Procurement and Data Sheet Request
- Issue equipment purchase orders (POs) to manufacturers
- Request manufacturer data sheets per specification requirements
- Specify submittal requirements (nameplate data, test reports, certifications)

### Step 2: Data Sheet Submittal Receipt
- Receive manufacturer data sheet submittals
- Log submittals in submittal register (submittal number, date received, equipment, manufacturer)
- Distribute to electrical engineer for technical review

### Step 3: Data Sheet Technical Review

**Implements**: FR-1 (Data Sheet Completeness), FR-2 (Specification Compliance), FR-3 (Calculation Verification) — See Specification.md.
**Rationale**: See Guidance.md — Principle 1 (Data Sheet as Compliance Verification Tool), Consideration 1 (Data Sheet Review Focus).

- **Review Scope**: Verify equipment ratings match specifications (DEL-17.02), verify ratings meet or exceed calculation requirements (DEL-17.03), verify test results acceptable, verify compliance certifications present (CSA/UL marks)
- **Review Criteria**: Ratings ≥ specified; test results within acceptable limits; certifications valid
- **Flag Deviations**: Identify any non-compliance issues for resolution with manufacturer

### Step 4: Data Sheet Approval or Rejection
- **Approved**: Equipment meets requirements; manufacturer may proceed with fabrication/shipment
- **Approved as Noted**: Minor deviations acceptable with noted conditions
- **Revise and Resubmit**: Non-compliance requires correction and resubmittal
- **Rejected**: Equipment does not meet requirements; not acceptable

### Step 5: Data Sheet Package Compilation
- Compile approved data sheets into organized package (by equipment type)
- Include: Table of contents, equipment index (tag numbers), data sheets with test reports, certifications
- Issue data sheet package for construction and commissioning use

### Step 6: As-Installed Data Sheet Updates (Post-Commissioning)
- Update data sheets with as-installed information: Relay settings as-left, serial numbers verified, installation/commissioning dates
- Issue final as-installed data sheet package for Owner operations and maintenance

## Verification

**Verification Activities**:
- Technical review (spec compliance, calculation verification)
- Test report review (results acceptable, standards compliance)
- Certification verification (CSA/UL marks present and valid)

**Sign-Off**: Electrical engineer (technical review), P.Eng. (approval), Procurement (submittal coordination)

## Records

**Documentation Outputs**: Transformer data sheets, switchgear data sheets, MCC data sheets, UPS data sheet

**Record Management**:
- Submittals filed in 2_Checking/ during review
- Approved data sheets filed in 3_Issued/
- As-installed data sheets filed in 3_Issued/ (as-built designation)

**Interfaces**: DEL-17.02 (specifications verified), DEL-17.03 (calculations verified), DEL-17.05 (commissioning baseline)

---
**Cross-Document Alignment Verified (Pass 3):** Steps 1-6 implement Specification.md requirements (FR-1 through FR-3, QR-1, QR-2). Verification activities align with Specification.md verification section. Prerequisites and records support Datasheet.md and Guidance.md. No conflicts identified.
