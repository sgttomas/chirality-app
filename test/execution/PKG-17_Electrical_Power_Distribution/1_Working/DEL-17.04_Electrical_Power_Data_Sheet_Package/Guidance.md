# Guidance: DEL-17.04 Electrical Power Data Sheet Package

## Purpose

This guidance document supports the development of **Electrical Power Data Sheet Package** for **PKG-17 Electrical Power Distribution**.

**Deliverable Purpose** (Source: Decomposition DEL-17.04 entry): Defines and substantiates electrical power in accordance with ER requirements.

**Downstream Use**: Equipment verification, installation planning, commissioning baseline, operations reference

## Principles

**1. Data Sheet as Compliance Verification Tool**
- **Principle**: Manufacturer data sheets verify that procured equipment meets project specifications
- **Rationale**: Data sheets bridge design (specifications, calculations) and physical equipment
- **Source**: Standard procurement practice; quality assurance

**2. Test Reports as Performance Evidence**
- **Principle**: Factory test reports provide objective evidence of equipment performance
- **Rationale**: Tests verify equipment ratings and compliance with standards (CSA, IEEE)
- **Source**: CSA C88, C802, C22.2 standards; IEEE C57, C37 standards

**3. As-Installed Documentation**
- **Principle**: Data sheets updated post-commissioning reflect actual installed equipment
- **Rationale**: As-installed data sheets are critical for operations, maintenance, future modifications
- **Source**: Project closeout and record documentation requirements

## Considerations

**1. Data Sheet Review Focus**
- **Key Checks**: Verify ratings match specifications, verify compliance certifications (CSA/UL marks), verify test results acceptable, flag deviations
- **Common Issues**: Equipment ratings lower than specified, missing certifications, test failures, incorrect voltage/frequency

**2. Submittal Timing**
- **Pre-Purchase**: Data sheets submitted for review before equipment procurement (allows design verification before commitment)
- **Pre-Shipment**: Final data sheets with test reports submitted before shipment (allows factory test witness if required)
- **Post-Installation**: As-installed data sheets with commissioning test results

**3. Data Sheet Package Organization**
- **Recommendation**: Organize by equipment type (all transformers together, all MCCs together) with table of contents and equipment index
- **Format**: PDF for distribution, searchable text, bookmarks for navigation

## Trade-offs

**1. Manufacturer Standard vs. Custom Data Sheets**
- **Manufacturer Standard**: Lower cost, faster delivery; may lack project-specific information
- **Custom Format**: Includes all project data; higher cost, longer lead time
- **Recommendation**: Manufacturer standard supplemented with project data (equipment tags, relay settings, test results)

**2. Pre-Purchase Review Depth**
- **Detailed Review**: Verify full compliance before purchase; reduces procurement risk but adds schedule time
- **Expedited Review**: Quick review of key ratings; faster but higher risk of non-compliance discovery later
- **Recommendation**: Detailed review for major equipment (transformers, switchgear); expedited review for standard items (small MCCs, UPS)

## Examples

**Example Data Sheet Content**:
- Transformer: Nameplate (kVA, voltage, impedance), outline drawing, test report (resistance, ratio, impedance, dielectric), certification (CSA mark)
- MCC: Nameplate (bus rating, SCCR), bucket schedule (starter sizes, motor data), test report (dielectric, functional), certification
- Switchgear: Nameplate (voltage class, bus rating, breaker ratings), one-line diagram, relay settings, test report, certification

**Reference Sources**: Manufacturer catalogs and submittal templates; IEEE/CSA standards for test report requirements
