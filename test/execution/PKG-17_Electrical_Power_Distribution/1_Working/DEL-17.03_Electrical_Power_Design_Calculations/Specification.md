# Specification: DEL-17.03 Electrical Power Design Calculations

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for **Electrical Power Design Calculations** within **PKG-17 Electrical Power Distribution**.

Provides the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for electrical power.

**Anticipated deliverable artifacts:**
- Load calculations
- short circuit analysis
- protection coordination
- voltage drop

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **TBD** — Functional requirements to be developed based on Employer's Requirements and design development.

### Performance Requirements

- **TBD** — Performance criteria to be defined per applicable codes and standards.

### Interface Requirements

- **TBD** — Interface requirements to be coordinated with adjacent packages and disciplines.
- See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` for dependency tracking (NOT_TRACKED — dependencies coordinated externally).

### Quality Requirements

- All work shall comply with the project Quality Management Plan.
- **TBD** — Specific quality requirements per deliverable type (Calculation).

## Standards

**Applicable codes and standards (Electrical discipline):**

- CSA C22.1 (CEC)
- CSA C22.2
- IEEE C2
- CSA Z462
- NFPA 70E

**Additional standards:**
- Employer's Requirements (project-specific)
- **TBD** — Additional applicable standards to be identified during design development

## Verification

**Verification methods for Calculation deliverables:**

- Independent check calculation
- Software output verification
- Design code compliance check
- Sensitivity analysis review

**Acceptance criteria:**
- **TBD** — To be defined per project quality procedures

## Documentation

**Required documentation outputs:**
