## Conditions

**Performance Test Context:**

Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for performance test. Performance testing with actual CSD canola oil product verifies facility achieves design capacity and project objectives before operational handover.

**Performance Objectives to Verify:**
- **OBJ-2: Throughput Capacity** — 1,000,000 MT per annum (permitted capacity)
- **OBJ-3: Storage Capacity** — 45,000 MT (3 × 15,000 MT tanks)
- **OBJ-4: Operational Flexibility** — Tank storage and direct rail-to-ship modes
- **OBJ-10: Custody Transfer Accuracy** — Metering system accuracy for revenue billing

**Facility:** 32 railcar unloading stations, 3×15,000 MT storage tanks, product transfer & metering, marine loading
