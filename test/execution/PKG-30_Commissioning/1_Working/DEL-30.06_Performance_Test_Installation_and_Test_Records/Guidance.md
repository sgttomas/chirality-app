# Guidance: DEL-30.06 Performance Test Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Supports development of **Performance Test Installation & Test Records** for PKG-30 Commissioning.

**Context:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for performance test. Performance testing with actual product demonstrates facility achieves project objectives and contractual requirements.

**Source:** Decomposition §5 PKG-30, DEL-30.06

## Principles

**P-1: Performance Testing is Contractual Acceptance Gate**

Performance testing provides objective evidence for contractual acceptance:
- Facility achieves design capacity (OBJ-2, OBJ-3)
- Operational flexibility demonstrated (OBJ-4)
- Custody transfer accuracy certified (OBJ-10)
- Safe and reliable operation demonstrated (OBJ-1)

Performance test records support Employer acceptance and project closeout.

**P-2: Actual Product Testing**

Performance testing uses actual CSD canola oil product (not water/air):
- Verifies product handling and quality maintenance
- Verifies metering accuracy with actual product properties
- Verifies operational procedures under actual conditions
- Identifies any product-specific issues

This provides highest confidence for operational handover.

**P-3: Capacity Verification Methodology**

Throughput capacity (1,000,000 MT/annum) verified by:
- Measuring transfer rates during performance test
- Calculating annualized throughput capacity
- Demonstrating all transfer paths operational (rail unloading, tank storage, ship loading)
- Verifying no capacity bottlenecks

Test duration and conditions defined to provide representative capacity demonstration.

## Considerations

**C-1: Performance Test Duration**

Performance test duration must be sufficient to demonstrate:
- Sustained operation (not just instantaneous rates)
- System reliability and availability
- Throughput capacity representative of annual operations
- Product quality maintenance over time

Typical performance test: 24-hour minimum to multi-day run test — **TBD**

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Performance test duration considerations

**C-2: Custody Transfer Metering Criticality**

Custody transfer metering accuracy directly affects revenue:
- Meter proving with actual product required
- Accuracy certification per custody transfer standards
- Flow computer and totalizer verification
- Witnessed by Employer and/or third-party inspector

Metering accuracy is non-negotiable performance requirement.

**C-3: Operational Readiness Demonstration**

Performance test demonstrates operators can:
- Execute complete operational scenarios
- Respond to normal and abnormal conditions
- Manage product transfers safely and efficiently
- Maintain product quality

Operations personnel actively participate in performance test.

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Performance Test Comprehensiveness vs. Product Cost**

**Trade-off:** Comprehensive performance testing provides high confidence but consumes product (CSD canola oil); streamlined testing reduces product cost but may not fully demonstrate capacity.

**Recommendation:** Risk-based test scope balancing confidence with cost; ensure contractual acceptance criteria met with minimum product consumption.

## Examples

**Anticipated Artifacts:**
- Performance test protocol with acceptance criteria
- Throughput capacity verification records (1,000,000 MT/annum calculation)
- Storage capacity verification records (45,000 MT)
- Custody transfer metering accuracy certification
- Operational flexibility demonstration (tank storage and direct rail-to-ship modes)
- Reliability demonstration (continuous operation test results)

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No conflicts identified during document enrichment. If conflicts arise during performance testing, they will be documented here:

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| (none) | | | | | | |

**Note:** Cross-deliverable conflicts are handled by RECONCILIATION agent when requested; this table captures only local conflicts within DEL-30.06 scope.
