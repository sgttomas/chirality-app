## Steps

**Step 1: Verify Prerequisites**
- Verify IST complete (DEL-30.05)
- Verify punch list items closed or deferred (DEL-30.07)
- Verify CSD canola oil product available for testing
- Verify operations personnel trained and ready

**Step 2: Prepare Performance Test Protocol**
- Develop performance test protocol per DEL-30.01 procedures
- Define test objectives: OBJ-2 (throughput), OBJ-3 (storage), OBJ-4 (flexibility), OBJ-10 (metering)
- Define test duration and methodology
- Define acceptance criteria per contract requirements
- Obtain protocol approval from Employer — **TBD**

**Step 3: Conduct Performance Test Briefing**
- Brief performance test team on objectives and protocol
- Review safety requirements
- Coordinate with terminal operations (OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity)
- Confirm Employer witness attendance

**Step 4: Execute Performance Test**

**Test 1: Throughput Capacity (OBJ-2)**
- Conduct railcar unloading operations (demonstrate 32 stations operational capability)
- Conduct tank filling operations
- Conduct ship loading operations
- Measure transfer rates and calculate annualized throughput capacity
- Target: Demonstrate 1,000,000 MT/annum capacity
- Document results and compare to acceptance criteria

**Test 2: Storage Capacity (OBJ-3)**
- Fill storage tanks to capacity
- Verify tank level instrumentation accuracy
- Calculate total storage capacity
- Target: Verify 45,000 MT total storage (3 × 15,000 MT tanks)
- Document capacity verification

**Test 3: Custody Transfer Metering Accuracy (OBJ-10)**
- Conduct meter proving with CSD canola oil
- Verify meter accuracy per custody transfer requirements
- Verify flow computer and totalizer operation
- Obtain accuracy certification
- Third-party witness if required
- Document metering accuracy certification

**Test 4: Operational Flexibility (OBJ-4)**
- Demonstrate tank storage mode: Railcar → Tank, Tank → Ship
- Demonstrate direct rail-to-ship mode: Railcar → Ship (bypassing tank storage)
- Verify valve lineup changes and routing
- Document operational flexibility demonstrated

**Test 5: Reliability and Continuous Operation (OBJ-1)**
- Conduct continuous operation test (24-hour minimum or as defined — **TBD**)
- Monitor system availability and reliability
- Document system performance and any interruptions
- Calculate availability percentage
- Document reliable operation demonstrated

**Test 6: Product Quality Verification**
- Collect product samples during performance test
- Verify CSD canola oil quality maintained (food-grade standards)
- Verify temperature control effective
- Verify no contamination
- Document product quality verification

**Step 5: Document Performance Test Results**
- Compile all performance test data
- Compare results to acceptance criteria
- Document acceptance or non-conformances
- If non-conformances: resolve and re-test

**Step 6: Obtain Sign-offs and Acceptance**
- QA/QC Manager reviews performance test records and signs
- Commissioning Manager reviews and signs
- Operations Manager reviews and signs (operational acceptance)
- Employer representative witnesses and provides acceptance sign-off
- Third-party inspector certifies custody transfer metering (if applicable)

**Step 7: Submit Performance Test Records**
- Compile all performance test records
- Submit to document control
- File in `3_Issued/DEL-30.06/`
- Notify project management: Performance acceptance achieved, facility ready for operational handover

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Performance test execution process

## Verification

- Performance test protocol executed
- All performance objectives demonstrated (OBJ-2, OBJ-3, OBJ-4, OBJ-10, OBJ-1)
- Acceptance criteria met
- Employer acceptance obtained
- Sign-offs complete

**Source:** Specification.md

## Records

**Outputs:**
- Performance test protocol
- Throughput capacity verification records
- Storage capacity verification records
- Custody transfer metering accuracy certification
- Operational flexibility demonstration records
- Reliability demonstration records
- Product quality verification records
- Employer acceptance certificate

**Management:**
- Filed in `3_Issued/DEL-30.06/`
- Retention: **TBD** — Permanent project records (contractual acceptance evidence)
