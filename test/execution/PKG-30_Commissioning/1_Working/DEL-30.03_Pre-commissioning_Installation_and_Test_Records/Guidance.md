# Guidance: DEL-30.03 Pre-commissioning Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Supports development of **Pre-commissioning Installation & Test Records** for PKG-30 Commissioning.

**Context:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for pre-commissioning. Critical for food-grade CSD canola oil quality, equipment warranty compliance, and operational readiness.

**Source:** Decomposition §5 PKG-30, DEL-30.03

## Principles

**P-1: Pre-commissioning is Foundation for Quality**

Pre-commissioning ensures systems are clean, tight, and ready before commissioning. Poor pre-commissioning leads to:
- Product contamination (food-grade canola oil purity compromised)
- Equipment damage and warranty voidance
- Custody transfer metering inaccuracy
- Commissioning delays and rework

Quality pre-commissioning records provide:
- Objective evidence of system readiness
- Warranty compliance documentation
- Regulatory compliance evidence
- Operational baseline for maintenance

**P-2: Record Quality Ensures Traceability**

Complete, accurate records provide traceability:
- What was done (activity description, procedure reference)
- When it was done (date/time stamps)
- How it was done (methods, parameters, acceptance criteria)
- Who did it (technician signatures)
- Who verified it (QC inspector, commissioning engineer sign-offs)
- What was the result (data, photos, pass/fail)

## Considerations

**C-1: System-Specific Requirements**

Different systems have different pre-commissioning needs:
- **Piping:** Flushing, cleaning, drying, hydrostatic/leak testing
- **Tanks:** Cleaning, drying, leak testing, internal inspection
- **Pumps:** Flushing, alignment check, run-in test
- **Metering:** Cleaning (critical for accuracy), proving preparation
- **Loading Arms:** Flushing, leak testing, swing test

Tailor records to system-specific requirements.

**C-2: Food-Grade Cleanliness Standards**

CSD canola oil is food-grade product. Pre-commissioning cleaning must meet food industry standards:
- Product-contact surfaces free of contamination
- No residual oils, greases, welding flux, rust
- Verification by visual inspection and/or laboratory testing
- Documentation of cleanliness standard met

**C-3: Photographic Evidence**

Photos provide objective evidence:
- Pre-condition (before flushing/cleaning)
- During activity (flushing medium discharge color/clarity)
- Post-completion (clean surfaces, dry conditions)
- Filter conditions (debris captured)

Photos supplement written records and support acceptance decisions.

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Record Detail vs. Efficiency**

**Trade-off:** Comprehensive records provide better traceability but take more time; streamlined records enable faster execution but may lack detail for future reference.

**Recommendation:** Balance detail with efficiency; comprehensive records for critical systems (tanks, metering), streamlined for routine systems (utility piping).

## Examples

**Anticipated Artifacts:**
- Flushing records: System ID, flushing procedure ref, medium/flow/duration, acceptance criteria, photos, sign-offs
- Cleaning records: System ID, cleaning procedure ref, agents/methods, cleanliness verification, photos, sign-offs
- Drying records: System ID, drying procedure ref, method/duration, dewpoint measurements, sign-offs

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No conflicts identified during document enrichment. If conflicts arise during record compilation, they will be documented here:

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| (none) | | | | | | |

**Note:** Cross-deliverable conflicts are handled by RECONCILIATION agent when requested; this table captures only local conflicts within DEL-30.03 scope.
