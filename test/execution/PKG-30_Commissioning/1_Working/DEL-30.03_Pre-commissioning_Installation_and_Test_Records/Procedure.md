# Procedure: DEL-30.03 Pre-commissioning Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Defines the process for generating, reviewing, and submitting **Pre-commissioning Installation & Test Records** for the Canola Oil Transload Facility.

**Context:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for pre-commissioning.

**Source:** Decomposition §5 PKG-30, DEL-30.03

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies:** NOT_TRACKED mode — See `_DEPENDENCIES.md`

**Upstream Requirements:**
- DEL-30.01 Pre-commissioning Procedures — Defines activities to be documented
- DEL-30.02 Commissioning Plan — Schedules pre-commissioning activities
- Pre-commissioning work complete per system

**Reference Materials:**
- Pre-commissioning procedures from DEL-30.01
- System design documents (PKG-10 through PKG-24)
- Applicable standards (CSA Z662, API 653, ASME B31.3) — **location TBD**

**Personnel:** Commissioning technicians, commissioning engineer, QC inspector

**Tools:** Record forms — **TBD**, camera for photos, test equipment (dewpoint meter, etc.)

**Source:** DEL-30.01, DEL-30.02; **ASSUMPTION**

## Steps

**Step 1: Prepare for Pre-commissioning Activity**
- Obtain approved pre-commissioning procedure (DEL-30.01)
- Obtain blank record forms for activity type (flushing, cleaning, drying)
- Review system boundaries and acceptance criteria
- Assemble tools and equipment

**Step 2: Execute Pre-commissioning Activity**
- Execute activity per DEL-30.01 procedure
- Record data during execution:
  - System ID and description
  - Procedure reference
  - Activity parameters (flow rate, duration, temperature, dewpoint, etc.)
  - Acceptance criteria verification
- Take photographs (pre-condition, during, post-completion)
- Record technician performing work

**Step 3: Verify Acceptance Criteria Met**
- Review acceptance criteria from procedure
- Verify data shows criteria met
- If not met: continue activity, troubleshoot, or escalate
- Document acceptance: "Acceptance criteria met" with evidence

**Step 4: Obtain Sign-offs**
- Commissioning engineer reviews record and signs
- QC inspector verifies and signs
- Authority witness signs if required — **TBD**

**Step 5: Submit Record**
- Submit completed record to document control
- File in `3_Issued/DEL-30.03/` organized by system
- Update pre-commissioning completion tracking

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard record generation process

## Verification

- Completeness check: All required fields populated
- Data accuracy: Parameters recorded correctly
- Acceptance verification: Criteria met and documented
- Sign-offs: Required signatures obtained

**Source:** Specification.md §Verification

## Records

**Outputs:**
- Flushing records (by system)
- Cleaning records (by system)
- Drying records (by system)

**Management:**
- Filed in `3_Issued/DEL-30.03/` by system
- Retention: **TBD** — Permanent project records
