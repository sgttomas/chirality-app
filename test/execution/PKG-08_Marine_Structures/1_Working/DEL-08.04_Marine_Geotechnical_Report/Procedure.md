## Procedure Steps (Production Workflow)

### Step 1: Investigation and Survey Planning

**Objective:** Define investigation/survey scope and obtain necessary approvals.

**Actions:**
1. Review ER requirements for geotechnical investigation and bathymetric survey scope
2. Review preliminary design layout (DEL-08.01) to identify boring/survey locations
3. Determine investigation scope: number of borings, locations, depths, sampling/testing program
4. Determine survey scope: survey extent, accuracy requirements, methods
5. Prepare investigation/survey plan and obtain approvals (Employer, regulatory if required)
6. Obtain environmental permits if required (e.g., fisheries authorization, contaminated sediment management)

**Verification:**
- Investigation/survey scope meets ER requirements and design needs
- Approvals and permits obtained

**Outputs:**
- Investigation/survey plan
- Permits and approvals

### Step 4: Data Processing and Analysis

**Objective:** Process field/lab/survey data and perform engineering analysis.

**Actions:**
1. **Data Processing:**
   - Compile boring logs and correlate stratigraphy between borings
   - Compile laboratory test results and assign to boring/depth intervals
   - Process bathymetric survey data (datum corrections, filtering, contouring)
   - Validate data (check for errors, anomalies, inconsistencies)
2. **Geotechnical Analysis:**
   - Interpret soil/rock properties from field/lab data
   - Assign design parameters (unit weight, strength, compressibility, etc.)
   - Perform pile capacity analysis (API RP 2A, CFEM, or equivalent)
   - Assess scour potential and estimate scour depth
   - Assess construction considerations (drivability, obstructions, etc.)
   - Perform seismic assessment if required
3. **Bathymetric Analysis:**
   - Generate contour maps and cross-sections
   - Identify seabed features and obstructions
   - Extract seabed elevations at key locations
4. Document assumptions and limitations
5. Prepare data tables, charts, and figures for report

**Verification:**
- Data processing complete and validated
- Analysis methods appropriate and consistent with codes/standards
- Results reasonable and consistent with site conditions

**Outputs:**
- Processed data (stratigraphy, test results, bathymetry)
- Analysis results (pile capacity, scour, seismic)
- Data tables, charts, figures
