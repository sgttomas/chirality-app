# Specification: DEL-08.07 Fender System Deflection Characteristics Data Package

## Scope

Defines requirements for **Fender System Deflection Characteristics Data Package**: minimum content, data quality, traceability, and documentation control.

**Deliverable intent:** Defines and substantiates fender system deflection characteristics data package in accordance with ER requirements. *(Source: Decomposition line 287)*

### Inclusions
- Fender performance curves (energy-deflection, reaction-deflection)
- Manufacturer/OEM technical data
- Compliance certificates and test documentation

### Exclusions
- Berthing energy calculations (DEL-08.06)
- Supplier design verification (DEL-08.08)
- Fender installation records (DEL-08.05)
