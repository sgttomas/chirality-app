| Weld repair records | Repair procedure; weld identification; repair description; re-inspection results | **TBD** |
| NDT personnel certifications | NDT technician certifications per CGSB or equivalent; certification levels and scope | **TBD** |

### Additional Installation Records (Based on PKG-08 Scope)

| Record Type | Expected Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Structural steel erection records | Erection survey (as-built dimensions, elevations, alignment); bolt installation records (torque/tension, bolt types, installation dates); field welding records | **TBD** *(for trestle, platform, catwalk, abutment structural steel)* |
| Coating/corrosion protection records | Surface preparation inspection (blast profile, cleanliness per SSPC); coating application records (coating type, thickness (DFT), application conditions, cure time); coating inspection reports (DFT measurements, holiday detection, adhesion tests) | **TBD** *(required by DEL-08.02 specification for marine corrosion protection)* |
| Dimensional inspection records | As-built survey of marine structures (pile locations, structural member dimensions, elevations, clearances); comparison to design drawings; deviations and acceptability | **TBD** |
| Concrete inspection records (if applicable) | Concrete mix designs and approvals; concrete placement records; concrete test results (slump, air content, compressive strength); curing records | **TBD** *(if concrete abutments or other concrete elements in scope)* |
| Material traceability records | Material certificates for all structural materials (steel, bolts, coatings, concrete); heat numbers and lot numbers; material test reports (MTRs) | **TBD** *(required for traceability and code compliance)* |

## Interfaces and Dependencies (Advisory)

Dependencies are coordinated externally per `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (mode: NOT_TRACKED). The following interfaces are anticipated:

### Interface to DEL-08.02 Marine Structures Technical Specification
- Specification defines inspection and testing requirements that must be documented in records — **TBD**
- **Coordination required:** Ensure record types and formats align with specification requirements; all specified inspections/tests have corresponding records

### Interface to DEL-08.01 Marine Structures Design Drawing Set
- As-built records (dimensions, elevations, pile locations) compared to design drawings — **TBD**
- **Coordination required:** Deviations from drawings identified and dispositioned

### Interface to DEL-08.04 Marine Geotechnical Report
- Pile driving records compared to geotechnical recommendations (penetration depth, driving criteria) — **TBD**
- Pile capacity verification from load testing (if required) compared to geotechnical design capacity — **TBD**

### Interface to Construction and QA/QC Team
- Records generated during construction by contractor and inspection personnel — **TBD**
- **Coordination required:** QA/QC procedures and record templates established before construction; inspection hold points defined

## Cross-Document Links

- **Requirements basis:** `Specification.md` (R-001 through R-005) defines what records must be included and format/acceptance requirements
- **Production workflow:** `Procedure.md` provides process for record collection, review, and packaging
- **QA/QC considerations:** `Guidance.md` provides rationale for record requirements and guidance on record management

## Key TBDs (Next Closure Items)

Priority items to resolve before construction and record collection:

1. **ER clause extraction for required QA/QC records** (supports `Specification.md` R-004): **TBD**
2. **Record templates and formats** (from ER or project QA procedures) (supports `Specification.md` R-002): **TBD**
3. **Inspection and test plan (ITP)** defining hold points, witnessing, and acceptance (supports `Specification.md` R-003): **TBD**
4. **Record storage and retention requirements** (supports `Specification.md` R-005): **TBD**
5. **Third-party inspection requirements** (Employer witness, regulatory authority, independent inspector) (supports `Specification.md` R-003): **TBD**
