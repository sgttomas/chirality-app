# Procedure: DEL-08.05 Marine Structures Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Define **repeatable workflow** for collecting, reviewing, and packaging installation and test records during marine structures construction and at project close-out.

**Deliverable intent (source-anchored):** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for marine structures. *(Source: Decomposition line 285 + `_CONTEXT.md`)*

## Prerequisites

**Dependency tracking mode:** NOT_TRACKED

**Required Inputs (TBD):**
- DEL-08.02 specification (inspection/test requirements)
- Approved ITP
- Record templates/forms
- ER QA/QC requirements

---

## Procedure Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Construction Setup
**Actions:**
1. Develop ITP per DEL-08.02 requirements
2. Obtain Employer approval of ITP
3. Prepare record templates/forms
4. Establish record filing system (physical and electronic)
5. Brief construction and QA/QC teams on ITP and record requirements

**Outputs:** Approved ITP, record templates, filing system

### Step 2: Real-Time Record Collection During Construction
**Actions:**
1. **Pile Driving:** Collect pile driving logs, material certificates, equipment records for each pile
2. **Pile Integrity Testing:** Collect test reports (PDA, sonic echo, load testing)
3. **Welding:** Collect WPS, WPQ, visual inspection reports, NDT reports, repair records
4. **Steel Erection:** Collect erection survey, bolt installation records
5. **Coating:** Collect surface prep inspection, coating application records, DFT measurements
6. **Dimensional Inspection:** Collect as-built survey
7. Enforce hold points (work stops for critical inspections)
8. Coordinate witness points (notify Employer/regulatory authority)
9. Review records for completeness daily
10. Photograph critical work

**Outputs:** Inspection/test records collected in real-time

---

### Step 3: Record Review and Non-Conformance Management
**Actions:**
1. QA/QC personnel review records for completeness, accuracy, traceability
2. Identify non-conformances (failed inspections/tests, missing records)
3. Document non-conformances (Non-Conformance Reports - NCRs)
4. Disposition NCRs (engineering review: accept-as-is, repair, reject)
5. Implement corrective actions (repairs, re-inspection, additional testing)
6. Close NCRs with verification

**Outputs:** Reviewed records, NCRs with dispositions

---

### Step 4: Record Organization and Indexing
**Actions:**
1. Organize records (by pile number, by structure element, by record type)
2. Create record register/index with document numbers, descriptions, dates
3. File records in organized system (physical binders and/or electronic folders)
4. Ensure backup of electronic records

**Outputs:** Organized records, record register

---

### Step 5: Close-Out Package Preparation
**Actions:**
1. Verify record completeness (all ITP activities have records)
2. Prepare summary report (scope of work, inspection/test results, NCRs and dispositions)
3. Compile close-out package (record register, organized records, summary report)
4. Prepare transmittal letter
5. Senior QA/QC manager reviews close-out package

**Outputs:** Close-out package, transmittal

---

### Step 6: Issue and Handover
**Actions:**
1. Submit close-out package to Employer
2. Obtain Employer acceptance
3. Update `_STATUS.md` to ISSUED
4. Archive records per retention requirements

**Outputs:** Issued records package, Employer acceptance, archived records
