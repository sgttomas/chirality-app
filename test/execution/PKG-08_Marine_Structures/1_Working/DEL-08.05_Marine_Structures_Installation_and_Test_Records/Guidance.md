# Guidance: DEL-08.05 Marine Structures Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Provide **engineering rationale and QA/QC guidance** to support systematic collection, review, and packaging of installation and test records that demonstrate marine structures construction quality and compliance.

**Deliverable intent (source-anchored):** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for marine structures. *(Source: Decomposition line 285 + `_CONTEXT.md`)*

## Principles

### Records as Evidence, Not Just Paper
- **Intent:** Records prove work was done correctly and meets acceptance criteria
- **Rationale:** Records support Employer acceptance, regulatory approval, warranty claims, future maintenance
- **Practice:** Ensure records capture actual results, not just checkmarks; photograph critical work

### Real-Time Collection and Review
- **Intent:** Collect records during construction, not after; review and resolve issues immediately
- **Rationale:** Retroactive records are unreliable; real-time review catches problems when corrective action still possible
- **Practice:** Establish hold points for critical inspections; QA personnel on-site during construction

### Traceability to Work and Specifications
- **Intent:** Each record must trace to specific work item and specification requirement
- **Rationale:** Enables verification that all work inspected; supports audit and close-out
- **Practice:** Use consistent identification (pile numbers, weld IDs); cross-reference records to ITP and DEL-08.02 specification

## Requirement Rationale Map

### R-001: Record Package Coverage
**Rationale:** Decomposition specifies minimum records; DEL-08.02 specification defines full scope of inspections/tests requiring records

**Key Considerations:**
- Cross-check record package against ITP to ensure no gaps
- Structural steel erection, coating, dimensional inspection likely required in addition to decomposition minimum

### R-002: Format, Traceability, Completeness
**Rationale:** Standardized formats improve consistency; traceability enables verification and audit

**Key Considerations:**
- Use templates/forms to ensure completeness
- Photograph critical work (before/during/after)
- Calibration certificates must be valid on inspection date

### R-003: ITP Alignment
**Rationale:** ITP is roadmap for QA/QC; hold points prevent defective work from progressing

**Key Considerations:**
- ITP approved by Employer before construction
- Hold points enforced (work stops until inspection performed and accepted)
- Witness points coordinated (Employer notified in advance)

### R-004: ER and Code Compliance
**Rationale:** Records demonstrate contractual and regulatory compliance

**Key Considerations:**
- Acceptance criteria from codes, DEL-08.02, ER
- Non-conformances require engineering disposition (accept-as-is, repair, reject)
- Regulatory witness may be required (Transport Canada, Coast Guard)

### R-005: Storage, Retention, Close-Out
**Rationale:** Records must be preserved and retrievable for project life and beyond

**Key Considerations:**
- Electronic backup for critical records
- Organized for close-out (by pile number, by date, by record type)
- Retention period typically 25+ years for structures

## Trade-offs

### Inspection Extent vs Cost/Schedule
**Trade-off:** 100% inspection provides highest confidence but increases cost/time; sampling inspection reduces cost but increases risk

**Decision:** **TBD** *(Follow DEL-08.02 specification and code requirements; critical welds may require 100% NDT; non-critical may allow sampling)*
