## Design Inputs and Basis (Not Yet Captured)

The specification content depends on design inputs and basis documents not yet extracted into this deliverable folder:

- **ER clauses for marine structures materials, performance, workmanship:** **TBD** *(ER Vol 2 Parts 1-2 present as PDFs; clause extraction pending)*
- **Codes and standards required by ER:** **TBD** *(likely: CSA S6, CSA S16, CSA W59, API standards for piling and marine structures, ASTM material standards; confirm from ER)*
- **Marine environment corrosion design basis:** **TBD** *(marine exposure classification, coating systems, cathodic protection requirements; from ER or marine engineering standards)*
- **Geotechnical design parameters:** **TBD** *(from DEL-08.04 Marine Geotechnical Report; affects piling specification requirements)*
- **Structural design criteria:** **TBD** *(from DEL-08.03 Marine Structures Design Calculations; affects material grades, member sizes, connection requirements)*

## Interfaces (Advisory)

Dependencies are coordinated externally per `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (mode: NOT_TRACKED). The following interfaces are anticipated based on decomposition scope and should be confirmed via design coordination:

### Interface to DEL-08.01 Marine Structures Design Drawing Set
- Drawings reference materials and specifications from this deliverable (DEL-08.02) — **TBD** *(coordination required to ensure drawing notes/materials are consistent with specifications)*
- Specifications provide detailed requirements for materials/workmanship shown on drawings — **TBD**

### Interface to DEL-08.03 Marine Structures Design Calculations
- Calculations establish structural design criteria (loads, stresses, member sizes, connection capacities) that inform specification requirements (material grades, connection details, inspection requirements) — **TBD**

### Interface to DEL-08.04 Marine Geotechnical Report
- Geotechnical report provides pile capacity and installation criteria that inform piling specification requirements (minimum penetration, driving criteria, load testing requirements) — **TBD**

### Interface to DEL-08.05 Marine Structures Installation & Test Records
- Specifications define inspection and testing requirements that must be documented in installation/test records — **TBD** *(coordination required to ensure specification requirements align with records scope)*

### Interface to Fabrication and Construction
- Specifications must be constructible and provide clear requirements for fabricators and contractors — **TBD** *(constructability review recommended before issue)*

## Cross-Document Links

- **Requirements basis:** `Specification.md` (R-001 through R-005) defines what must be included in the technical specification deliverable and verification criteria
- **Production workflow:** `Procedure.md` provides step-by-step process to produce the specification, aligned to Specification requirements
- **Engineering considerations:** `Guidance.md` provides rationale for each Specification requirement and checklists for content coverage

## Key TBDs (Next Closure Items)

Priority items to resolve before specification drafting can commence:

1. **ER clause extraction for marine structures materials, performance, workmanship requirements** (supports `Specification.md` R-002): **TBD**
2. **Codes and standards identification** (required by ER for marine structures) (supports `Specification.md` R-002): **TBD**
3. **Project specification template or format requirements** (supports `Specification.md` R-003): **TBD**
4. **Marine corrosion protection design basis** (marine exposure classification, coating systems) (required for structural steel specification): **TBD**
5. **Geotechnical design parameters** (from DEL-08.04; required for piling specification): **TBD**
