# Specification: DEL-08.03 Marine Structures Design Calculations

## Scope

This specification defines the requirements for **Marine Structures Design Calculations** within **PKG-08 Marine Structures**.

Provides the engineering basis and sizing/verification calculations for marine structures.

**Anticipated deliverable artifacts:**
- Pile capacity calculations
- trestle structural calculations
- mooring analysis

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **TBD** — Functional requirements to be developed based on Employer's Requirements and design development.

### Performance Requirements

- **TBD** — Performance criteria to be defined per applicable codes and standards.

### Interface Requirements

- **TBD** — Interface requirements to be coordinated with adjacent packages and disciplines.
- See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` for dependency tracking (NOT_TRACKED — dependencies coordinated externally).

### Quality Requirements

- All work shall comply with the project Quality Management Plan.
- **TBD** — Specific quality requirements per deliverable type (Calculation).

## Standards

**Applicable codes and standards (Marine discipline):**

- CSA S472
- PIANC Guidelines
- Transport Canada Marine Standards
- NFPA 30

**Additional standards:**
- Employer's Requirements (project-specific)
