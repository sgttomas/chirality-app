## Description

**Purpose:** Documents analysis and results for current assessment basis report required for design verification and approvals. *(Source: Decomposition line 290)*

**Report objective:** Establishes design basis for water current conditions at berth location, providing input for mooring analysis (DEL-08.09), structural loading (DEL-08.03), and debris loading assessment (DEL-08.11).

## Site Context

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Location | Fraser Surrey Terminal, Fraser River, BC *(Decomposition)* |
| River system | Fraser River — tidally influenced, significant freshet flows |
| Current drivers | Tidal + river flow + freshet — combined hydrodynamic regime |
