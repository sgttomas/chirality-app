# Procedure: DEL-29.08 Hydrotest Water Disposal Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Process for managing **Hydrotest Water Disposal Installation & Test Records**.

**Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for hydrotest water disposal. **Source:** Decomposition line 653

**Type:** Record | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` — **NOT_TRACKED** (coordinated externally)

**Required Inputs:**
- DEL-29.06: Water Management Plan (disposal method)
- DEL-29.07: Test Results (for discharge authorization)
- Disposal permit or licensed hauler contracted

### Personnel
- Environmental specialist or waste coordinator
- Hauler (if haul-away)
- Site personnel (for manifest signatures)

## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare for Disposal
**Activities:**
1.1. Confirm disposal method (discharge or haul-away) per DEL-29.06
1.2. If haul-away: Contract licensed hauler, confirm disposal facility
1.3. Prepare manifests (pre-print with project info)
1.4. Set up disposal tracking log

**Outputs:** Disposal arrangements in place

### Step 2: Execute Discharge (if direct discharge)
**Activities:**
2.1. Verify water quality compliant (per DEL-29.07)
2.2. Obtain discharge authorization
2.3. Open discharge valve, monitor flow
2.4. Record discharge date, time, volume, location
2.5. Document in tracking log

**Outputs:** Discharge completed and documented

### Step 3: Execute Haul-Away (if haul-away disposal)
**Activities:**
3.1. Hauler arrives with truck
3.2. Complete manifest (generator section)
3.3. Load water into truck, record volume
3.4. Generator representative signs manifest
3.5. Driver signs manifest, departs
3.6. Retain generator copy of manifest
3.7. Record in tracking log (manifest #, date, volume, destination)
3.8. Repeat for each load

**Outputs:** Hauling manifests (generator copies)

### Step 4: Receive Disposal Confirmation
**Activities:**
4.1. Receive final manifests with receiver signatures (from hauler)
4.2. Receive disposal receipts from facility
4.3. Verify manifest numbers match tracking log
4.4. File manifests and receipts

**Outputs:** Completed manifests and disposal receipts

### Step 5: Verify Volume Balance
**Activities:**
5.1. Calculate total volume generated (from tank fill records)
5.2. Calculate total volume disposed (discharge + haul-away)
5.3. Verify balance (volume in ≈ volume out, within acceptable tolerance)
5.4. Investigate and resolve discrepancies

**Outputs:** Volume balance verification

### Step 6: Compile Disposal Records
**Activities:**
6.1. Collect all manifests and receipts
6.2. Finalize disposal tracking log (with totals and balance)
6.3. Organize into disposal records package
6.4. File in document management system

**Outputs:** Compiled disposal records (this deliverable)

## Verification

**V-1:** All water accounted for
**V-2:** Manifests/receipts complete
**V-3:** Volume balance verified
**V-4:** Records filed

### Acceptance Criteria
**AC-1:** All disposal complete
**AC-2:** All records complete
**AC-3:** Volume balance acceptable

## Records

**Primary Deliverables:**
- Hauling manifests (if haul-away)
- Disposal receipts
- Disposal tracking log

**Filing:**
- Working: `1_Working/DEL-29.08_Hydrotest_Water_Disposal_Installation_and_Test_Records/`
- Issued: `3_Issued/`
- Archive: Project document management system (permanent environmental records)

**Status:** See `_STATUS.md`
