# Guidance: DEL-29.08 Hydrotest Water Disposal Installation & Test Records

## Purpose

Guidance for **Hydrotest Water Disposal Installation & Test Records** for **PKG-29 Testing**.

**Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for hydrotest water disposal. **Source:** Decomposition line 653

**Type:** Record | **Discipline:** T&C | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Principles

### "Cradle to Grave" Waste Tracking

**Environmental Responsibility:** Generator (Contractor) responsible for waste from generation through final disposal, even if hauled by third party.

**Key Principle:** Document every step. Manifests and receipts prove proper disposal.

## Considerations

**1. Licensed Hauler Selection**
- Verify hauler has valid permits/licenses
- Check insurance and safety record
- Get references from hauler

**2. Approved Disposal Facility**
- Verify facility authorized to accept liquid waste
- Confirm facility has capacity for volume
- Get disposal cost estimate before committing

**3. Manifest Management**
- Pre-print manifests with project info
- Driver carries manifest, gets signatures at each step
- Generator keeps copy, receives final copy with receiver signature
- Track manifest numbers (no gaps or duplicates)

**4. Volume Tracking**
- Truck volumes may be estimated (not precise measurement)
- Accept reasonable variance (±5-10%)
- Investigate large discrepancies

## Trade-offs

**Direct Discharge vs. Haul-Away:**
- Discharge: Faster, cheaper (~$0/m³ if permit), but requires compliance testing
- Haul-Away: Slower, expensive (~$5-10/m³), but guaranteed disposal, no testing needed
- **Typical:** Pursue discharge; use haul-away if non-compliant or permit delayed

## Examples

**Hauling Manifest Example:**

```
