# Guidance: DEL-29.07 Hydrotest Water Treatment & Discharge Testing Results

## Purpose

Guidance for **Hydrotest Water Treatment & Discharge Testing Results** for **PKG-29 Testing**.

**Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for hydrotest water treatment & discharge testing results. **Source:** Decomposition line 652

**Type:** Record | **Discipline:** T&C | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Principles

### "Test Before You Discharge"

**Never discharge without testing.** Unauthorized or non-compliant discharge creates environmental violations, regulatory penalties, and potential ecosystem harm.

**Key Principle:** Measure, verify compliance, then discharge. Stop immediately if non-compliant.

## Considerations

**1. Sample Representativeness**
- Sample from well-mixed location (not stagnant corners)
- Composite samples may be required (multiple grabs mixed)
- Preserve samples per laboratory requirements (cool, acidify, etc.)

**2. Laboratory Selection**
- Use accredited lab (ISO 17025)
- Verify lab can test all required parameters
- Coordinate turnaround time (results before discharge)

**3. Treatment System Monitoring**
- Check treatment daily, not just at start/end
- Filter pressure indicates when filters need changing
- Settling tanks need periodic sludge removal

**4. Contingency Planning**
- If water fails discharge limits: Continue treatment, re-test, or switch to haul-away
- Have hauler on standby if discharge uncertain

## Trade-offs

**Speed vs. Thoroughness:**
- Rushing treatment risks non-compliance
- Extra treatment time is cheaper than penalties or haul-away
- **Recommendation:** Allow adequate treatment time, don't rush discharge

## Examples

**Water Quality Test Report Format:**

```
LABORATORY REPORT
Sample ID: TK-101-Post-Treatment
Sample Date: 2024-08-06 10:30
Lab: ABC Environmental Labs (ISO 17025 Accredited)

Parameter | Result | Unit | Permit Limit | Compliant?
----------|--------|------|--------------|------------
pH | 7.2 | - | 6.0-9.0 | Yes
TSS | 45 | mg/L | <100 | Yes
Oil & Grease | 8 | mg/L | <15 | Yes
COD | 120 | mg/L | <200 | Yes
Zinc | 0.08 | mg/L | <0.5 | Yes

Overall Compliance: PASS

Approved for discharge: J. Smith, Environmental Specialist
