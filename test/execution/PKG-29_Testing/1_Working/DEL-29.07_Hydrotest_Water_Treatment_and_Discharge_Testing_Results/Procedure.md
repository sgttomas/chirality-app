# Procedure: DEL-29.07 Hydrotest Water Treatment & Discharge Testing Results

## Purpose

Process for collecting and managing **Hydrotest Water Treatment & Discharge Testing Results**.

**Purpose:** Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for hydrotest water treatment & discharge testing results. **Source:** Decomposition line 652

**Type:** Record | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` — **NOT_TRACKED** (coordinated externally)

**Required Inputs:**
- DEL-29.06: Water Management Plan (sampling/testing plan)
- Discharge permit with limits
- Accredited laboratory contracted

### Personnel
- Environmental specialist or technician
- Test Engineer
- Laboratory personnel

## Steps

### Step 1: Collect Samples Per Plan
**Activities:**
1.1. Follow sampling plan from DEL-29.06
1.2. Collect pre-treatment samples (from tanks)
1.3. Collect post-treatment samples (from treatment system)
1.4. Document sample ID, location, date/time
1.5. Preserve and deliver to laboratory

**Outputs:** Samples delivered to lab with chain of custody

### Step 2: Operate Treatment System
**Activities:**
2.1. Operate treatment system per design
2.2. Log daily operations (flow rates, chemical dosing, maintenance)
2.3. Monitor performance (visual, flow, pressure)
2.4. Adjust as needed

**Outputs:** Treatment system logs

### Step 3: Receive and Review Test Results
**Activities:**
3.1. Receive laboratory reports
3.2. Review results against permit limits
3.3. Calculate treatment efficiency
3.4. Determine compliance (pass/fail)

**Outputs:** Test results reviewed and assessed

### Step 4: Authorize or Halt Discharge
**Activities:**
4.1. If compliant: Authorize discharge
4.2. If non-compliant: Halt discharge, continue treatment, re-sample, or switch to haul-away
4.3. Document decision

**Outputs:** Discharge authorization or corrective action

### Step 5: Monitor Discharge
**Activities:**
5.1. Monitor discharge (flow rate, visual observations)
5.2. Document discharge event (date, time, volume, location)
5.3. Photograph discharge point

**Outputs:** Discharge monitoring records

### Step 6: Compile Records
**Activities:**
6.1. Collect all laboratory reports
6.2. Collect treatment logs
6.3. Collect discharge records
6.4. Organize into environmental compliance package
6.5. File in document management system

**Outputs:** Compiled testing and discharge records (this deliverable)

## Verification

**V-1:** All samples collected per plan
**V-2:** Test results received and reviewed
**V-3:** Discharges complied with permits
**V-4:** Records complete

### Acceptance Criteria
**AC-1:** Testing complete
**AC-2:** Discharge compliant
**AC-3:** Records filed

## Records

**Primary Deliverables:**
- Water quality test results
- Treatment logs
- Discharge testing records

**Filing:**
- Working: `1_Working/DEL-29.07_Hydrotest_Water_Treatment_and_Discharge_Testing_Results/`
- Issued: `3_Issued/`
- Archive: Project document management system (permanent environmental records)

**Status:** See `_STATUS.md`
