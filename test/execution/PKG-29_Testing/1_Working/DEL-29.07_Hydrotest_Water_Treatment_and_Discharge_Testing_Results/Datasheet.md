## Conditions

**Operating / Environmental Context:**

Provides evidence of completion, inspection, and testing for hydrotest water treatment & discharge testing results. **Source:** Decomposition line 652

**Record Purpose:**

These records demonstrate:
1. Hydrotest water quality before and after treatment
2. Treatment system effectiveness
3. Discharge water quality compliance with permit limits
4. Environmental protection during hydrostatic testing

**Project Objectives Supported:**
- OBJ-7: Environmental Protection (water testing prevents environmental harm)
- OBJ-6: Regulatory Compliance (testing records prove permit compliance)

**Source:** Decomposition Section 2, Section 6

## Construction

**Record Types and Content:**

### 1. Water Quality Test Results

**Pre-Treatment Samples (from tanks after hydrotest):**
- Sample ID, tank ID, sample date/time, sampler name
- Test parameters and results:
  - pH, temperature, conductivity
  - Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
  - Oil & Grease
  - Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or BOD
  - Heavy metals (Zn, Cr, Ni if coating contains metals)
  - Other parameters per permit requirements
- Laboratory: Name, accreditation, report number
- Comparison to discharge limits (pass/fail assessment)

**Post-Treatment Samples (after treatment system):**
- Same parameters as pre-treatment
- Treatment efficiency calculation (% removal)
- Confirmation of compliance with discharge limits

**Source:** Typical industrial wastewater testing **ASSUMPTION**

### 2. Treatment Logs

**Daily Treatment System Operation Log:**
- Date, operator name
- Flow rate through treatment (m³/hr)
- Treatment system parameters:
  - Settling time in tanks
  - Filter pressure drop (indicates when to change filters)
  - Chemical dosing rates (coagulants, pH adjustment)
  - Sludge/solids removal
- Issues or adjustments noted
- Downtime or maintenance

**Treatment Performance:**
- Volume treated per day
- Cumulative volume treated
- Treatment efficiency (compare pre- and post-treatment water quality)

**Source:** Typical treatment system operations **ASSUMPTION**

### 3. Discharge Testing Records

**Discharge Monitoring:**
- Date/time of discharge
- Discharge location (outfall ID)
- Discharge flow rate
- Discharge water quality (from post-treatment samples)
- Receiving water quality (baseline, if required by permit)
- Permit limits vs. actual values (compliance table)
- Visual observations (color, odor, floating materials, sheen)

**Compliance Certification:**
- Statement that discharge met permit requirements
- Signatures: Test engineer, environmental specialist, QC

**Non-Compliance (if any):**
- Description of exceedance
- Cause investigation
- Corrective action taken
- Re-sampling and re-testing results

**Source:** Typical discharge monitoring report format **ASSUMPTION**
