**Purpose:** Defines planned approach and controls for tank hydrotest water management to meet ER requirements. **Source:** Decomposition line 651

**Type:** Plan | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

### Inclusions
- Water sourcing and fill plan
- Treatment approach for hydrotest water
- Sampling and testing plan
- Discharge or hauling plan
- Environmental compliance

### Exclusions
- Actual test records (DEL-29.07, 29.08)
- Tank hydrotest procedure (covered in DEL-29.01)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Water Source and Fill**
- Identify water source (municipal, river intake, trucked-in)
- Obtain required permits/approvals for water taking
- Plan fill rate and duration to avoid supply disruption
- Plan fill sequence to manage water demand

**FR-2: Treatment System**
- Design or specify treatment system adequate for water volume and contamination
- Treatment shall achieve discharge water quality standards
- Backup disposal option if treatment inadequate (haul-away)

**FR-3: Sampling and Testing**
- Sampling plan covering pre-fill, post-fill, pre-discharge, post-treatment
- Test parameters per discharge permit requirements
- Laboratory accredited for required tests **ASSUMPTION**

**FR-4: Discharge/Disposal**
- Obtain discharge permit (river or municipal sewer) or arrange licensed hauler
- Discharge/disposal method shall comply with environmental regulations
- Document disposal per DEL-29.08

### Performance Requirements

**PR-1: Water Quality**
- Treated water shall meet discharge permit limits before release
- If permit limits cannot be met, water shall be hauled to approved treatment facility

**PR-2: Timing**
- Plan shall account for seasonal restrictions (fish spawning, water temperature limits) **ASSUMPTION**
- Plan shall support hydrotest schedule without causing project delays

### Interface Requirements

**IR-1: Regulatory Compliance**
- Coordinate with environmental authorities (BC MOE, Metro Vancouver, DFO) for permits
- Coordinate with municipal water utility for water supply

**IR-2: Coordination with Hydrotest**
- Water management plan integrated with hydrotest procedures (DEL-29.01)
- Treatment/disposal capacity matches hydrotest drain schedule

### Quality Requirements

**QR-1: Plan Approval**
- Plan reviewed by HSE and environmental specialist
- Plan submitted to Employer and regulatory authorities as required
- Plan approved before commencing hydrotest

**QR-2: Environmental Compliance**
- All activities comply with permits and regulations
- Non-compliance incidents reported and resolved

## Standards

- API 650: Hydrotest requirements
- BC Environmental Management Act: Discharge permits
- Fisheries Act: Protection of fish habitat
- Metro Vancouver Sewer Use Bylaw (if applicable)
- Municipal bylaws (water taking, discharge)
- Employer's Requirements **location TBD**

## Verification

**VM-1:** Plan covers all required elements (sourcing, treatment, testing, disposal)
**VM-2:** Permits obtained or permit applications in progress
**VM-3:** Treatment system capacity adequate for water volume
**VM-4:** Plan approved by Employer and authorities

### Acceptance Criteria
**AC-1:** Plan complete and technically adequate
**AC-2:** Environmental permits obtained or confirmable
**AC-3:** Plan approved by Employer

## Documentation

**Required Outputs:**
- Hydrotest fill/hold/drain plan
- Treatment approach (system design or specification)
- Sampling/testing plan
- Discharge/hauling plan
- Permit copies or applications
