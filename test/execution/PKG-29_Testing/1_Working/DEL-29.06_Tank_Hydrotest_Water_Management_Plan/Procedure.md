# Procedure: DEL-29.06 Tank Hydrotest Water Management Plan

## Purpose

Process for developing **Tank Hydrotest Water Management Plan**.

**Deliverable Purpose:** Defines planned approach and controls for tank hydrotest water management to meet ER requirements. **Source:** Decomposition line 651

**Type:** Plan | **Responsible:** D&B Contractor (QA/QC)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
See `_DEPENDENCIES.md` — **NOT_TRACKED** (coordinated externally)

**Required Inputs:**
- DEL-13.01-13.06: Storage Tanks (tank design, volumes, coatings)
- Hydrotest schedule
- Environmental baseline (receiving water standards)

### Personnel
- Environmental specialist or consultant
- QA/QC Manager
- Test Engineer
- HSE Manager

## Steps

### Step 1: Assess Water Volume and Schedule
**Activities:**
1.1. Determine tank volumes and hydrotest duration
1.2. Develop hydrotest schedule (sequential or simultaneous)
1.3. Calculate total water requirement

**Outputs:** Water volume estimate, schedule

### Step 2: Identify Water Source
**Activities:**
2.1. Evaluate options (municipal, river, trucked)
2.2. Assess capacity and cost
2.3. Identify permit requirements
2.4. Select preferred source

**Outputs:** Water source plan

### Step 3: Assess Contamination Potential
**Activities:**
3.1. Review tank coating specifications
3.2. Identify potential contaminants (rust, coating leachate, oils)
3.3. Estimate treatment needs

**Outputs:** Contamination assessment

### Step 4: Develop Treatment Approach
**Activities:**
4.1. Design or specify treatment system (settling, filtration, pH adjustment)
4.2. Size system for water volume and drain rate
4.3. Identify treatment system supplier/rental

**Outputs:** Treatment system plan

### Step 5: Develop Sampling/Testing Plan
**Activities:**
5.1. Identify test parameters (pH, TSS, O&G, metals, COD)
5.2. Define sampling points and frequency
5.3. Select accredited laboratory
5.4. Define acceptance criteria (permit limits)

**Outputs:** Sampling and testing plan

### Step 6: Evaluate Discharge/Disposal Options
**Activities:**
6.1. Assess discharge to river (permit requirements, receiving water standards)
6.2. Assess discharge to municipal sewer (permit, capacity, fees)
6.3. Assess haul-away option (cost, logistics)
6.4. Select preferred option and backup

**Outputs:** Discharge/disposal plan

### Step 7: Obtain Permits
**Activities:**
7.1. Prepare permit applications (water taking, discharge)
7.2. Submit applications with adequate lead time
7.3. Respond to regulatory agency questions
7.4. Obtain approvals

**Outputs:** Environmental permits

### Step 8: Compile and Submit Plan
**Activities:**
8.1. Compile plan document (fill, treatment, testing, discharge)
8.2. Include permits and approvals
8.3. Review with HSE and environmental specialist
8.4. Submit to Employer for acceptance
8.5. Address comments and finalize

**Outputs:** Approved Tank Hydrotest Water Management Plan (this deliverable)

## Verification

**V-1:** Plan covers sourcing, treatment, testing, disposal
**V-2:** Permits obtained or confirmable
**V-3:** Treatment capacity adequate
**V-4:** Plan approved by Employer

### Acceptance Criteria
**AC-1:** Plan complete and technically sound
**AC-2:** Environmental compliance assured
**AC-3:** Employer approval obtained

## Records

**Primary Deliverables:**
- Hydrotest fill/hold/drain plan
- Treatment approach
- Sampling/testing plan
- Discharge/hauling plan
- Permit copies

**Filing:**
- Working: `1_Working/DEL-29.06_Tank_Hydrotest_Water_Management_Plan/`
- Checking: `2_Checking/To/` (during Employer review)
- Issued: `3_Issued/` (upon approval)

**Status:** See `_STATUS.md`
