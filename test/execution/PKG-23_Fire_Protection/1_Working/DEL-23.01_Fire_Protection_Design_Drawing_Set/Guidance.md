## Principles

**Engineering Rationale (Fire Protection for Combustible Liquid Facilities):**

The following engineering principles govern fire protection design for canola oil transload facilities:

**P-1: Defense in Depth**
- Fire protection systems employ multiple layers of protection: prevention (design for fire safety), detection (early warning), suppression (fire control/extinguishment), and mitigation (limiting fire spread)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Fundamental fire protection engineering principle per NFPA guidelines
- Application: Drawing set shall depict all layers (detection, alarm, suppression systems)

**P-2: Life Safety Priority**
- Protection of life is the highest priority, followed by property protection and business continuity
- Fire alarm systems provide early warning for personnel evacuation
- Fire suppression systems control fire to allow safe egress and emergency response access
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA and building code hierarchy of fire protection objectives
- Application: Hydrant/egress coordination, alarm audibility coverage

**P-3: Code Compliance as Minimum**
- NFPA 30 establishes minimum requirements for combustible liquid facilities; good engineering practice may exceed code minimums based on risk assessment
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard engineering approach to code compliance
- Application: Fire water demand, hydrant spacing, foam system design basis

**P-4: Risk-Based Design**
- Fire protection systems shall be commensurate with hazards present:
  - Combustible liquid storage (tanks) — highest risk, foam suppression and cooling systems
  - Marine loading operations — high risk due to product transfer, foam systems for loading arms
  - Railcar unloading — moderate risk, hydrant coverage and detection
  - Pump/process areas — moderate risk, detection and hydrant coverage
  - Buildings/control rooms — lower risk (relative), code-compliant systems
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Risk-based approach typical for industrial fire protection per NFPA 30 hazard assessment
- Application: Fire protection system type and intensity vary by facility zone

**P-5: Reliability and Redundancy**
- Fire protection systems are safety-critical and require high reliability
- Redundancy and backup provisions (e.g., looped fire water system, dual detection zones, emergency power) enhance reliability
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Reliability engineering principles and OBJ-1 (Safe & Reliable Operation)
- Application: Fire water loop (not dead-end), redundant power for fire alarm

**P-6: Integration with Operations**
- Fire protection systems integrated with facility control systems for monitoring, alarming, and automated responses (e.g., process shutdown on fire alarm)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Modern industrial facility practice
- Application: Fire alarm/control system interfaces (see PKG-19)

**Combustible Liquid Fire Protection Specific Principles:**

**P-7: Foam Suppression for Flammable/Combustible Liquids**
- Water alone is ineffective for flammable/combustible liquid fires; foam systems required for rapid fire suppression and vapor suppression
- Fixed foam systems typically required for storage tanks and transfer areas per NFPA 30
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 30 and NFPA 11 requirements for combustible liquid fire suppression
- Application: Tank foam systems, marine loading arm foam systems

**P-8: Cooling and Exposure Protection**
- Adjacent tanks and structures require cooling water (deluge or monitors) to prevent fire spread and structural failure during fire events
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 30 requirements for exposure protection
- Application: Tank cooling systems, hydrant/monitor placement for exposure protection

**Applicable Standards Context:**

| Standard | Role | Key Principles | Source |

## Considerations

**Factors to Consider During Development:**

**Site and Facility Considerations:**

**C-1: Site Constraints**
- Existing terminal operations and infrastructure — fire protection routing must avoid conflicts with existing utilities, structures, and operational areas
- Phased construction and operational continuity (OBJ-5: Terminal Continuity) — fire protection systems may need to be installed and tested in phases without disrupting existing terminal operations
- Site access for construction and emergency response vehicles
- Source: Decomposition Section 2 (OBJ-5) and **ASSUMPTION** regarding site constraints at operating terminal
- Impact on Design: Fire water loop routing, hydrant placement, construction sequencing

**C-2: Environmental Conditions**
- Fraser Valley climate: freezing temperatures require freeze protection for exposed piping, hydrants, and foam concentrate
- Seismic Zone: BC seismic requirements (NBCC 2020) — fire protection piping, equipment, and supports require seismic design
- Outdoor exposure: UV degradation of above-ground piping, corrosion protection
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: BC climate and seismic zone
- Impact on Design: Buried fire mains vs. above-ground with heat tracing, hydrant drain valves, seismic pipe supports

**C-3: Product Characteristics**
- CSD canola oil is a Class IIIA combustible liquid (flash point >93°C / 200°F) per NFPA 30 classification

- Product may solidify at low temperatures, affecting foam selection and system drainage
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Typical CSD canola oil properties and NFPA 30 classification
- Impact on Design: Foam concentrate type (alcohol-resistant AFFF or fluoroprotein), foam system winterization

**Operational Considerations:**

**C-4: Facility Throughput and Operations**
- High throughput (1,000,000 MT/annum) and continuous operations require fire protection systems that do not impede normal operations
- Railcar unloading (32 stations) and marine loading operations are continuous — fire protection must not create operational bottlenecks
- Source: Decomposition Section 1.1 (throughput) and OBJ-4 (Operational Flexibility)
- Impact on Design: Zoned fire alarm (avoid nuisance shutdowns), hydrant placement for accessibility without obstructing rail/vehicle movements

**C-5: Storage Capacity and Tank Configuration**
- 45,000 MT storage in 3 × 15,000 MT tanks — tank size and spacing drive foam system sizing and cooling requirements
- Tank spacing affects exposure fire scenarios and fire water demand
- Source: Decomposition Section 1.1
- Impact on Design: Tank foam system design, fire water demand calculation (DEL-23.03), hydrant/monitor placement for tank exposure protection

**C-6: Operational Flexibility (OBJ-4)**
- Facility supports both tank storage operations and direct rail-to-ship transfer — fire protection must accommodate both modes
- Source: Decomposition Section 2 (OBJ-4)
- Impact on Design: Fire protection coverage for both operational modes, flexibility in system shutdown/isolation

**Coordination Considerations:**

**C-7: Interdisciplinary Coordination**
- Fire water loop routing coordinated with civil (grading, roads, underground utilities), process piping (foam connections), electrical (power supply), and control systems (monitoring)
- Timing: Fire protection drawings require input from other disciplines (site plan, electrical load list, control system architecture) and provide output to other disciplines (space requirements, power/control requirements)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard interdisciplinary coordination for multi-discipline project
- Impact on Design: IDC cycles, drawing issue sequencing, coordination drawings

**C-8: Marine Terminal Specific Coordination**
- Marine loading operations require coordination with PKG-08 (Marine Structures), PKG-09 (Marine Outfitting), and PKG-11 (Marine Loading System)

- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Typical marine terminal fire protection requirements
- Impact on Design: Marine fire main design, wharf hydrant/monitor locations, loading arm foam system interfaces

**C-9: Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) Requirements**
- Fire marshal or local fire authority will review and approve fire protection design
- Early coordination with AHJ recommended to identify jurisdiction-specific requirements beyond code minimums
- Pre-fire planning with local fire department (hydrant locations, access, product information)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard AHJ coordination for industrial fire protection
- Impact on Design: AHJ review cycles, potential design modifications per AHJ comments

**Regulatory and Code Considerations:**

**C-10: Code Compliance and Interpretation**
- Multiple codes and standards apply (NFPA 30, NFPA 24, NFPA 72, NBCC, BCFC); potential conflicts or overlaps require engineering judgment
- Where codes conflict, most stringent requirement typically governs, or AHJ ruling required
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Standard code compliance practice
- Impact on Design: Code analysis, documentation of code compliance basis

**C-11: Permit and Approval Requirements**
- Fire protection systems require permits and inspections (building permit, fire system permit)
