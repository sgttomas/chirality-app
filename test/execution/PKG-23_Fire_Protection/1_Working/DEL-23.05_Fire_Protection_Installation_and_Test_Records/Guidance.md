## Principles

**Fire Protection Testing and Commissioning Principles:**

**P-1: Code-Required Testing**
- Fire protection systems must be tested per applicable NFPA codes (NFPA 24, NFPA 291, NFPA 20, NFPA 11, NFPA 72)
- NFPA codes prescribe specific test procedures, acceptance criteria, and documentation requirements
- Code-compliant testing is prerequisite for AHJ approval and facility operations permit
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Code compliance requirement
- Application: Follow NFPA test procedures and document per NFPA requirements

**P-2: Performance Verification**
- Testing verifies installed systems meet design performance requirements (from DEL-23.03 calculations)
- Test results compared to acceptance criteria (from DEL-23.02 specifications)
- Performance testing validates design assumptions and calculations
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Performance verification principle
- Application: Compare test results to design requirements; investigate significant deviations

**P-3: As-Built Verification**
- Inspections verify systems installed per design drawings (DEL-23.01) and specifications (DEL-23.02)
- As-built deviations identified and resolved (or documented for as-built drawings)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: As-built verification principle
- Application: Inspect installations against drawings; document deviations

**P-4: Quality Assurance**
- Test equipment calibrated and appropriate for measurements
- Testing witnessed by qualified personnel (Contractor QC, third-party QC, AHJ)
- Failed tests result in corrective actions and re-testing
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: QA/QC principle
- Application: Use calibrated test equipment; obtain witness sign-offs; re-test after corrections

**P-5: Permanent Record**
- Test and inspection records are permanent facility records
- Records retained for life of facility for operations, maintenance, and future modifications
- Records transferred to Employer/Owner at project completion
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Permanent record principle
- Application: Prepare complete, professional records suitable for long-term retention

**P-6: AHJ Approval Requirement**
- Fire protection systems require AHJ (fire marshal, building official) inspection and approval
- AHJ approval prerequisite for facility occupancy permit
- Test records demonstrate compliance for AHJ review
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: AHJ approval requirement
- Application: Coordinate AHJ inspections; obtain AHJ approval certificates

## Considerations

**Testing Planning and Execution Considerations:**

**C-1: Testing Schedule Coordination**
- Testing performed after system installation complete and ready for testing
- Testing coordinated with construction schedule and substantial completion milestones
- Critical path testing (AHJ inspections) scheduled early to avoid project delays
- Weather considerations for outdoor testing (temperature, precipitation)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Testing schedule coordination
- Impact: Testing schedule development and coordination with construction

**C-2: Test Preparation**
- Systems prepared for testing (piping filled, valves positioned, power connected, etc.)
- Test equipment procured and calibrated prior to testing
- Test procedures reviewed and understood by test personnel
- Witnesses notified and available (Contractor QC, third-party QC, AHJ, Employer)

**C-3: Hydrostatic Testing (Fire Water Piping)**
- NFPA 24 requires hydrostatic testing of fire water piping at 200 psi or 50 psi above working pressure (whichever greater) for 2 hours
- Testing performed after piping installation complete and before burial (for underground piping)
- Piping filled with water and air bled from system
- Test pressure maintained for test duration; no leaks and minimal pressure drop acceptable
- Failed tests result in leak repairs and re-testing
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 24 hydrostatic test requirements
- Impact: Hydrostatic test planning, equipment, and execution

**C-4: Flow Testing (Fire Hydrants)**
- NFPA 291 prescribes fire hydrant flow testing procedures
- Testing measures static pressure, residual pressure at test point, and flow rate at flowing hydrant (using pitot gauge)
- Flow test verifies fire water system can deliver required flow and pressure (from DEL-23.03 hydraulic calculation)
- Most hydraulically remote hydrant typically tested (or multiple hydrants per test plan)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 291 flow test requirements
- Impact: Flow test planning, equipment (pitot gauges, pressure gauges), and execution

**C-5: Fire Pump Testing (if applicable)**
- NFPA 20 requires fire pump acceptance testing at 0%, 100%, 150% of rated flow
- Testing measures flow, suction pressure, discharge pressure, pump speed, motor current
- Pump performance compared to manufacturer pump curve and design requirements
- Testing typically requires test header or connection to discharge flow for testing
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 20 fire pump test requirements
- Impact: Fire pump test planning, test header design, test equipment, and execution

**C-6: Fire Alarm Testing**
- NFPA 72 Chapter 14 prescribes fire alarm system inspection, testing, and maintenance procedures
- Testing includes device-by-device functional test (activate each detection device, verify alarm at panel and notification devices)
- Battery load test verifies battery capacity per design (24-hour standby + 5-minute alarm from DEL-23.03 calculation)
- Integration testing verifies fire alarm system integrates with facility SCADA/DCS (if applicable)
- Testing typically performed by fire alarm system vendor commissioning technician with Contractor QC and AHJ witness
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 72 fire alarm test requirements
- Impact: Fire alarm test planning, vendor coordination, test execution

- Testing typically requires foam concentrate and water supply; foam discharge collected and measured
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: NFPA 11 foam system test requirements
- Impact: Foam system test planning, foam concentrate procurement for testing, test execution

**C-8: Test Equipment and Calibration**
- Test equipment (pressure gauges, flow meters, pitot gauges, multimeters, etc.) must be calibrated and calibration current
- Calibration certificates obtained and included in test records
- Test equipment accuracy appropriate for measurements (e.g., gauge accuracy ±2% of reading)

**C-11: Weather and Environmental Conditions**
- Outdoor testing subject to weather constraints (temperature for hydrostatic test and flow test, wind/rain for fire alarm device testing)
- Freezing temperatures may require testing delays or special provisions (heated water for hydrostatic test, temporary enclosures)
- BC winter conditions may impact testing schedule
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Weather considerations for BC climate
- Impact: Testing schedule flexibility and contingency planning

**C-12: Training Coordination**

- **Option B:** Contractor self-inspection — lower cost, relies on Contractor QC, less independent oversight
- **Trade-off:** Independent verification vs. cost
- **Decision Factors:** Employer requirements, contract requirements, insurance requirements, AHJ requirements
- **Status:** **TBD** per project requirements
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: QC inspection approach trade-off

**T-3: Test Documentation Format**

- **Option B:** Test forms/checklists (standardized forms with data entry and pass/fail boxes) — efficient, standardized, adequate for most testing
- **Trade-off:** Documentation detail vs. efficiency
- **Recommendation:** Test forms/checklists for routine testing (hydrostatic, flow test); detailed reports for complex tests (fire pump performance, foam system, fire alarm integration) if needed
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Test documentation format trade-off
