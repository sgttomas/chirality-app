## Principles

**P-1: Performance + Prescriptive Approach**
- Technical specifications for design-build projects typically combine performance requirements (what the system must achieve) with prescriptive requirements (specific materials/methods) to balance flexibility with quality control
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Design-build specification approach
- Application: Specify performance criteria (flow rates, pressures) while also specifying acceptable materials and standards

**P-2: Code Compliance as Foundation**
- Fire protection specifications must be rooted in applicable NFPA codes and standards — specifications should reference specific code sections and requirements
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Fire protection engineering practice
- Application: Cite NFPA 30, NFPA 24, NFPA 72, etc. requirements throughout specification

**P-3: Approved Products and Equivalents**
- Specifications should allow for competitive procurement by specifying "or approved equal" provisions, unless sole-source is technically justified
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Design-build procurement principle
- Application: Specify equipment by performance or by "ABC model or approved equal"

**P-4: Clarity and Enforceability**
- Specification requirements must be clear, unambiguous, measurable, and enforceable — avoid vague language
- Use "shall" for mandatory requirements, "should" for recommendations, "may" for options
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Specification writing best practice
- Application: Write testable requirements with clear acceptance criteria

**P-5: Consistency with Design**
- Specifications must be consistent with fire protection design drawings (DEL-23.01) and calculations (DEL-23.03) — no conflicts
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Document set coordination requirement
- Application: Cross-check specification requirements with drawings and calculations

## Considerations

**C-1: CSI MasterFormat Organization**
- Use CSI MasterFormat or similar standard specification organization for consistency and familiarity
- Fire protection systems typically span multiple CSI divisions (Division 21 for fire suppression, Division 28 for fire alarm)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Industry-standard specification format
- Impact: Organize specification into MasterFormat sections

**C-2: Three-Part Specification Format**
- Standard construction specifications use 3-part format: Part 1 General (scope, submittals, quality), Part 2 Products (materials, equipment), Part 3 Execution (installation, testing)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: CSI specification format
- Impact: Structure each specification section with Parts 1, 2, 3

**C-3: Submittal Requirements**
- Clearly define what submittals are required (shop drawings, product data, samples, test reports) and when they are due
- Submittals are critical for quality control in design-build
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Design-build quality control
- Impact: Include comprehensive submittal requirements in Part 1 of each specification section

**C-4: Testing and Commissioning Requirements**
- Detailed testing requirements ensure systems are installed correctly and meet performance criteria
- Testing requirements should reference NFPA testing standards (NFPA 24, NFPA 291, NFPA 72, NFPA 11)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Fire protection system commissioning requirement
- Impact: Include testing procedures and acceptance criteria in Part 3 of each specification section

**C-5: Coordination with DEL-23.01 (Drawings)**
- Drawings show "what" and "where"; specifications describe "how" and "what quality"
- Drawing notes should reference specification sections (e.g., "See Section 21 11 00")
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Drawing-specification coordination
- Impact: Coordinate drawing callouts with specification section numbers

**C-6: Coordination with DEL-23.03 (Calculations)**
- Calculations provide sizing basis; specifications include the calculated sizes and performance requirements
- Example: Calculation determines fire water demand → specification includes demand requirement
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Calculation-specification coordination
- Impact: Incorporate calculation results into specification performance requirements

**C-7: Coordination with DEL-23.04 (Data Sheets)**
- Data sheets provide detailed equipment specifications that supplement the technical specification
- Specification may reference data sheets for equipment details
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Specification-data sheet coordination
- Impact: Reference data sheets where appropriate in specification

**C-8: Estimator and Constructor Input**
- Design-build specifications benefit from early estimator and constructor input to ensure specifications are constructible, competitively biddable, and complete for pricing
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Design-build collaboration
- Impact: Conduct estimator/constructor reviews of specification

**C-9: Freeze Protection Requirements**
- BC climate requires freeze protection for fire protection systems (-40°C design temperature)
- Specifications must address winterization (buried pipe depths, heat tracing, dry-barrel hydrants, foam concentrate freeze protection)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: BC climate consideration
- Impact: Include freeze protection requirements in specifications

**C-10: Seismic Design Requirements**
- BC seismic zone requires seismic design for fire protection systems (pipe supports, equipment anchorage)
- Specifications must reference NBCC 2020 seismic requirements
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: BC seismic requirement
- Impact: Include seismic design and installation requirements in specifications

**C-11: Marine/Coastal Environment Corrosion**
- Marine terminal environment requires enhanced corrosion protection for fire protection systems
- Specifications must address corrosion protection (coatings, materials selection)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Marine environment consideration
- Impact: Include corrosion protection requirements in specifications

## Trade-offs

**T-1: Performance vs. Prescriptive Specification**
- **Option A:** Performance-based specification (specify performance criteria, let constructor select materials/methods) — greater contractor flexibility, more risk transfer, requires strong acceptance criteria
- **Option B:** Prescriptive specification (specify exact materials, methods, equipment) — less flexibility, more design control, may limit competition
- **Trade-off:** Flexibility vs. control
- **Recommendation:** Hybrid approach — performance criteria + acceptable materials/methods (typical design-build approach)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Specification approach trade-off

**T-2: Approved-Equal Provisions**
- **Option A:** "Or approved equal" provisions for all equipment — promotes competition, lower cost potential, requires evaluation effort
- **Option B:** Sole-source specifications — ensures specific product, limits competition, may increase cost
- **Trade-off:** Competition/cost vs. design certainty
- **Recommendation:** "Or approved equal" for most equipment; sole-source only where technically justified (compatibility, unique features)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Procurement approach trade-off

**T-3: Specification Detail Level**
- **Option A:** Highly detailed specification (extensive requirements, less ambiguity) — longer to produce, clearer for constructor, limits flexibility
- **Option B:** Performance-focused specification (less detail, more performance criteria) — faster to produce, more contractor interpretation, requires strong acceptance testing
- **Trade-off:** Design effort vs. construction risk vs. flexibility
- **Recommendation:** Moderate detail level — prescriptive for critical items, performance-based where flexibility acceptable
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Design-build specification detail trade-off

**T-4: Specification Modularization**
- **Option A:** Single comprehensive fire protection specification document — easier to manage, may be very long
- **Option B:** Multiple specification sections (one per system) — modular, easier to coordinate with CSI divisions, may require more cross-references
- **Trade-off:** Document management vs. modularity
- **Recommendation:** Multiple specification sections per CSI MasterFormat divisions (industry standard approach)
- Source: **ASSUMPTION**: Specification organization trade-off
