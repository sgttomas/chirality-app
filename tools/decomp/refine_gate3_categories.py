"""Refine Chirality Gate 3 category boundaries and rerun ratification.

This is a deterministic refinement helper for the Chirality self-domain
decomposition. It does not change atom text. It rewrites category scopes,
applies explicit primary-function boundary rules to the draft category ledger,
marks existing ambiguous assignment findings as resolved by forced decision, and
recomputes BM25/dense category-scope evidence against an existing source_v2
snapshot.
