# Chirality App 4.0.0 release limitations

Companion to [`RELEASE_TARGET_4.0.0.md`](RELEASE_TARGET_4.0.0.md), for its
exit criterion 11. This is the single list of what the release does not do
that a person could expect of it. Agent 0 keeps it, with a reason for each
entry. The owner sees the whole list with the request for the verdict
(criterion 12), and what a person receives with the package is written from
it (DEL-01-06).

An entry states a limitation, its reason and what it means for a person using
the App. It holds no status: an entry that
no longer applies is removed, and Git keeps its history.

## Entry form

Each entry is one subsection:

- **Id:** `LIM-nnn`, assigned in order and never reused.
- **Exit criteria:** the release target's exit criteria it affects, by number.
- **What is unavailable:** in the person's terms.
- **Why:** the reason, in one or two sentences.
- **What the person does instead:** the supported alternative, if any.
- **Basis:** the deliverable that governs it.

An entry is added in the same pull request that makes the limitation standing.

## Entries

### LIM-001: The capture-seal key cannot be rotated

- **Id:** LIM-001
- **Exit criteria:** 7
- **What is unavailable:** once a person has protected registered workflows
  with their keychain, the key that seals registrations cannot be replaced
  with a new one.
- **Why:** no rotation mechanism is built for 4.0.0.
- **What the person does instead:** nothing replaces it in 4.0.0; the key
  enrolled on an installation stays the key that seals and verifies
  registrations there.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-04 (keychain protection); DEL-01-06 REQ-007.

### LIM-002: The keychain-held approval policy can be changed a bounded number of times

- **Id:** LIM-002
- **Exit criteria:** 7
- **What is unavailable:** after 256 changes of the workflow approval policy
  on an installation with keychain protection, the policy can no longer be
  changed and stays as last stored.
- **Why:** each change is kept as its own keychain item in a bounded
  sequence, so that an edit, deletion or replay outside the keychain cannot
  change the policy; writes past the bound are refused.
- **What the person does instead:** nothing is needed in ordinary use, since a
  person changes this policy rarely.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-04 (keychain protection); DEL-02-02 (the workflow
  approval policy).

### LIM-003: macOS on Apple Silicon only

- **Id:** LIM-003
- **Exit criteria:** 9
- **What is unavailable:** the App on Windows, on Intel Macs, or on a macOS
  earlier than 15.
- **Why:** 4.0.0 targets macOS on Apple Silicon first; Windows follows the
  macOS release.
- **What the person does instead:** use a Mac with Apple Silicon running
  macOS 15 or later.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-06; PRD V4-CST-02.

### LIM-004: No standalone OpenAI API-key access

- **Id:** LIM-004
- **Exit criteria:** 5
- **What is unavailable:** entering an OpenAI API key in the App as a way to
  reach a model.
- **Why:** it is omitted from this increment; the access modes are the
  ChatGPT account and a local model server.
- **What the person does instead:** sign in with a ChatGPT account, or
  configure a local model server.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-05; PRD V4-APP-02.

### LIM-005: v3 chats are not imported

- **Id:** LIM-005
- **Exit criteria:** 13
- **What is unavailable:** bringing conversations from v3 into v4. Existing
  data under the App's identity is left as it is: nothing imports, resets or
  reseals it.
- **Why:** no migration or import of v3 chats is selected for the initial
  delivery.
- **What the person does instead:** v3.0.1 stays available as the fallback
  for work and history kept there.
- **Basis:** DEL-11-01; PRD §8 and OQ-12.

### LIM-006: Standalone use only

- **Id:** LIM-006
- **Exit criteria:** 1, 2
- **What is unavailable:** using the App's agent embedded in a host
  application such as SWBPIPE, and Domains.
- **Why:** a live host journey is the host's own requirement and is outside
  this release; Domains follows in a later increment.
- **What the person does instead:** use the App standalone, with the
  workflows it ships and those the person registers.
- **Basis:** DEL-09-07 and DEL-09-11 (held outside 4.0.0); PRD §8.
