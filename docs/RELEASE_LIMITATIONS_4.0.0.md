# Chirality App 4.0.0 release limitations

Companion to [`RELEASE_TARGET_4.0.0.md`](RELEASE_TARGET_4.0.0.md), for its
exit criterion 12. This is the single list of what the release does not do
that a person could expect of it. Agent 0 keeps it, with a reason for each
entry. The owner sees the whole list with the request for the verdict
(criterion 13), and what a person receives with the package is written from
it (DEL-01-06).

An entry states a limitation, its reason and what it means for a person using
the App. It holds no status: an entry that
no longer applies is removed, and Git keeps its history.

## Entry form

Each entry is one subsection:

- **Id:** `LIM-nnn`, assigned in order and never reused.
- **Exit criteria:** the release target's exit criteria it affects, by number.
- **What is unavailable:** in the person's terms.
- **Why:** the reason, in one or two sentences.
- **What the person does instead:** the supported alternative, if any.
- **Basis:** the deliverable that governs it.

An entry is added in the same pull request that makes the limitation standing.

## Entries

### LIM-001: The capture-seal key cannot be rotated

- **Id:** LIM-001
- **Exit criteria:** 8
- **What is unavailable:** once a person has protected registered workflows
  with their keychain, the key that seals registrations cannot be replaced
  with a new one.
- **Why:** no rotation mechanism is built for 4.0.0.
- **What the person does instead:** nothing replaces it in 4.0.0; the key
  enrolled on an installation stays the key that seals and verifies
  registrations there.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-04 (keychain protection); DEL-01-06 REQ-007.

### LIM-002: The keychain-held approval policy can be stored a bounded number of times

- **Id:** LIM-002
- **Exit criteria:** 8
- **What is unavailable:** on an installation with keychain protection, the
  workflow approval policy can be stored 256 times in all, counting the first,
  written when protection is set up. Saving the policy unchanged also uses
  one. After that the policy can no longer be changed and stays as last
  stored.
- **Why:** each stored policy is kept as its own keychain item in a bounded
  sequence, so that an edit, deletion or replay outside the keychain cannot
  change the policy; writes past the bound are refused.
- **What the person does instead:** nothing replaces it in 4.0.0; once the
  allowance is used, further changes to the policy cannot be saved.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-04 (keychain protection); DEL-02-02 (the workflow
  approval policy).

### LIM-003: macOS on Apple Silicon only

- **Id:** LIM-003
- **Exit criteria:** 10
- **What is unavailable:** the App on Windows, on Intel Macs, or on a macOS
  earlier than 15.
- **Why:** 4.0.0 targets macOS on Apple Silicon first; Windows follows the
  macOS release.
- **What the person does instead:** use a Mac with Apple Silicon running
  macOS 15 or later.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-06; PRD V4-CST-02.

### LIM-004: No standalone OpenAI API-key access

- **Id:** LIM-004
- **Exit criteria:** 6
- **What is unavailable:** entering an OpenAI API key in the App as a way to
  reach a model.
- **Why:** it is omitted from this increment; the access modes are the
  ChatGPT account and a local model server.
- **What the person does instead:** sign in with a ChatGPT account, or
  configure a local model server.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-05; PRD V4-APP-02.

### LIM-005: v3 chats are not imported

- **Id:** LIM-005
- **Exit criteria:** 14
- **What is unavailable:** bringing conversations from v3 into v4. Existing
  data under the App's identity is left as it is: nothing imports, resets or
  reseals it.
- **Why:** no migration or import of v3 chats is selected for the initial
  delivery.
- **What the person does instead:** v3.0.1 stays available as the fallback
  for work and history kept there.
- **Basis:** DEL-11-01; PRD §8 and OQ-12.

### LIM-006: Released and examined as a standalone application

- **Id:** LIM-006
- **Exit criteria:** 1, 2
- **What is unavailable:** assurance about the App's use with a host
  application such as SWBPIPE, and Domains. 4.0.0 is released and examined as
  a standalone application; its use with a host is not examined for this
  release.
- **Why:** a live host journey is the host's own requirement and is outside
  this release; Domains follows in a later increment.
- **What the person does instead:** use the App standalone, with the
  workflows it ships and those the person registers.
- **Basis:** DEL-09-07 and DEL-09-11 (held outside 4.0.0); PRD §8.

### LIM-007: Records packages and log checkpoints are unsigned

- **Id:** LIM-007
- **Exit criteria:** 15
- **What is unavailable:** a signature on an exported records package, and a
  signed checkpoint over a records log. A package verifies as internally
  consistent with its own manifest and chain heads; it does not show which
  installation produced it, and a package whose records and manifests were
  replaced together still verifies. A records log shows a changed, removed or
  reordered line only where later lines still carry their original links: a
  change to the content of a log's last line that keeps its link, lines
  removed from its end, and an edit by someone who recomputes the links after
  it can go unshown.
- **Why:** no key is chosen to sign log checkpoints and export manifests.
- **What the person does instead:** verify a package with the verifier it
  carries, and establish where it came from by other means.
- **Basis:** DEL-04-03 (TBD-003; AC-009 and AC-011).

### LIM-011: A local model server is set up in the App, on the same machine, with a key

- **Id:** LIM-011
- **Exit criteria:** 6
- **What is unavailable:** a conversation on a local provider defined in the
  person's own Codex settings; a conversation with a model server on another
  machine; and a local model server that requires no key. In the home that
  uses the ChatGPT account, the App's Codex runs on the built-in OpenAI
  provider whatever default provider the person's Codex settings name. In the
  local model home, Codex's plugin traffic is always off, whatever the
  person's Codex plugin setting. Changing the local server's address removes
  the saved key. An existing conversation continues only when the model name
  now set matches the model Codex recorded for it, and then uses the server
  at the address now set; otherwise it cannot continue under the current
  settings.
- **Why:** at the selected supplier version, Codex runs conversations only on
  the provider its process started with, so account and local access use
  separate homes. The release requires a local credential, limits the server
  to this machine to keep the key and conversation content from travelling
  off it without the protections that requires, and removes the saved key
  when the address changes so it cannot be sent to another server.
- **What the person does instead:** set the local server's address and model
  name in the App's local model settings, run the model server on the same
  machine with a key, enter the key again after changing the address, and
  start a new conversation to use a different model name.
- **Basis:** DEL-01-05 (REQ-003, REQ-010, AC-003, AC-005, AC-008, AC-011);
  PRD V4-APP-02.
