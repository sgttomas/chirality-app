Hiring Manager  
Equinox Engineering  

Re: AI Automation Developer

I am applying for the AI Automation Developer role at Equinox Engineering. I am a hands-on builder who ships practical internal tools, and I also bring 20+ years of industrial engineering and project delivery experience in oil and gas and other regulated environments. That combination lets me translate real operational pain points into software that is reliable enough to live inside day-to-day workflows.

Most recently, I designed and built Chirality App, a local-first desktop harness for running AI agents against a user-selected project folder where the filesystem is the system of record. The agent framework ensures operational reliability: controlled write scopes, permissioned tool execution, structured artifacts, session persistence, and streaming logs that make runs auditable and debuggable. In practice, that means turning messy, imperfect real-world inputs into deterministic outputs that teams can review and iterate on safely.

This is the same mindset I would bring to Equinox:

- Build production-ready internal tools using modern LLM APIs (prompting plus logic plus validation plus error handling) rather than "demo scripts".
- Design workflows that tolerate ambiguity, partial inputs, and edge cases without silently corrupting outputs.
- Collaborate directly with users to tighten requirements, iterate quickly, and make the tool fit the way work actually happens.
- Leverage my engineering background to understand how technical documents, drawings, approvals, and regulatory constraints affect tool design and adoption.

Technically, I am strongest in API design, structured data extraction (schemas, registers, provenance), and shipping maintainable systems with good logging and validation. I also natively use AI agents for the development workflow, with explicit guardrails so they produce reviewable results.

I would welcome the chance to discuss where Equinox sees the highest-leverage automation opportunities (document/drawing interpretation, extraction and validation utilities, internal assistants, workflow automation) and to walk through how I design these systems so they are useful, safe, and maintainable.

Sincerely,  
Ryan Tufts, P.Eng.
