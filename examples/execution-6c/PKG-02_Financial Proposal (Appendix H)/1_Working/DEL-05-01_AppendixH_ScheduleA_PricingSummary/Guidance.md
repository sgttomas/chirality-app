# Guidance: DEL-05-01 AppendixH ScheduleA PricingSummary

## Purpose

**Why this deliverable exists:**

Schedule A of Appendix H serves as the **pricing summary and formal offer** for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal. It fulfills three critical functions:

1. **Evaluation instrument:** Provides the Owner's Evaluation Committee with a standardized, comparable pricing summary across all proponents (35 points out of 100 total evaluation score)

2. **Contractual commitment:** Once submitted, constitutes an irrevocable offer that, if accepted by the Owner, forms the basis of the contract price under CCDC 14-2013

3. **Addenda compliance record:** Documents that the proponent has received and incorporated all addenda into their pricing, which is a potential disqualification factor if incomplete

**Source:** RFP Section 8.3 (page 26) evaluation weighting; RFP Appendix G Letter of Offer (page 56) irrevocable offer language; RFP Appendix H addenda acknowledgment requirement (page 57)

**Downstream impact:** Schedule A pricing directly affects:
- Proposal evaluation score (35% of total score)
- Contract award decision (if tied technical scores, lowest price wins per RFP Section 8.6, page 28)
- Baseline contract price for project delivery if proposal is successful

**Evaluator Perspective (Lensing: D-006):** Beyond the 35-point price score, consider how pricing quality may affect Owner perception:
- Pricing clarity may influence technical score perception (confidence in proponent capability)
- Well-documented assumptions may improve negotiation leverage if awarded
- Transparency may build trust for project delivery relationship

**Note (Lensing: E-004):** This Purpose section addresses proponent perspective but does not fully articulate "worth" beyond competitive scoring. Value extends to Owner confidence and negotiation positioning.

## Principles

### P-01: Template Fidelity

**Principle:** The RFP provides a mandatory template that must be used exactly as provided.

**Rationale:** Standardized forms enable fair comparison across proponents and reduce evaluation burden. Deviations from the template may be interpreted as non-compliance and risk proposal disqualification.

**Source:** RFP Section 4.3 (page 13); Section 2.5 (page 9) disqualification provision for incomplete proposals

**Application:** Do not modify the Schedule A form structure, line item descriptions, or numbering. Fill in the template as-is.

---

### P-02: Summary vs Detail Separation

**Principle:** Schedule A is a summary document; Schedule B provides the supporting detail.

**Rationale:** The two-schedule structure allows the Evaluation Committee to quickly compare total prices (Schedule A) while having access to detailed breakdowns (Schedule B) for credibility assessment and value analysis.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H structure (pages 57-59); note on page 57 requiring completion of both schedules

**Application:**
- Schedule A: Present clean summary totals (7 lines only)
- Schedule B: Show detailed cost buildup (General Requirements, Buildings, Sitework, breakdown of each option)
- Pricing Narrative (DEL-05-03): Explain assumptions, allowances, exclusions, addenda impacts

---

### P-03: Addenda Integration as Compliance Gate

**Principle:** Addenda acknowledgment is not merely procedural; it is a compliance verification that may result in disqualification if incomplete.

**Rationale:** Addenda modify the RFP requirements and scope. Failure to acknowledge addenda suggests the proponent may have priced obsolete or incorrect scope, which undermines the fairness and validity of the procurement process.

**Source:** RFP Section 2.9 (page 11): "All addenda become part of the Request for Proposal documents, must be addressed and acknowledged by the Proponents and must be confirmed and acknowledged within the Proponents submitted Proposal."

RFP Appendix H (page 57): "Failure to acknowledge receipt and inclusion of all addenda may result in this Price Proposal being disqualified, at the discretion of the Owner."

**Application:**
- List all addenda received (01, 02, 03) in the addenda acknowledgment section
- Verify that pricing reflects addenda impacts (e.g., pickled sand building removed, new requirements added)
- Cross-reference with pricing narrative to demonstrate addenda integration

---

### P-04: Fixed-Price Risk Allocation

**Principle:** This is a lump-sum fixed-price Design-Build contract; the Design-Builder assumes cost risk for scope delivery within the contract price.

**Rationale:** Design-Build procurement transfers design risk and cost certainty to the Design-Builder. The Owner benefits from price certainty; the Design-Builder must incorporate appropriate contingencies and risk allowances.

**Source:** RFP Section 8.5 (page 28): "total proposed fixed fee for Design-Build delivery"

CCDC 14-2013 contract structure (referenced in RFP Section 5.4, page 15)

**Application:**
- Base price must be sufficient to deliver all OSR requirements (as modified by addenda)
- Estimator should include contingencies for unknowns within the lump sum price
- **Exception:** Cash allowances are permitted for service tie-ins per Addendum 03 section 1.7; these may be carved out

---

### P-05: Tax Separation (Clarity and Procurement Law Compliance)

**Principle:** Taxes are shown separately from contract prices to ensure clarity and compliance with procurement and tax regulations.

**Rationale:**
- Municipalities may have different tax treatment than private owners (e.g., GST rebate eligibility)
- Separating taxes allows the Owner to understand the pre-tax contract value
- Some jurisdictions require tax-exclusive pricing for public procurement evaluation

**Source:** RFP Section 4.3 (page 13): "The project costs (Schedule A), with taxes shown separately"

**ASSUMPTION:** Standard Canadian public procurement practice

**Note (Lensing: A-002):** This principle references "procurement and tax regulations" generically. Specific applicable statutes or codes should be identified if available to strengthen the regulatory rationale.

---

### P-06: Non-Template Optional Items (Lensing: B-012)

**Principle:** Scope items that are "optional" but not one of the 6 named template options (e.g., FF&E) should be handled consistently.

**Rationale:** The RFP template provides 6 additional option lines, but Addendum 03 permits FF&E as an additional item. A consistent principle is needed for handling such items.

**Application:**
1. If item can fit within an existing template line (via clarification in pricing narrative), include there
2. If item requires separate pricing, propose in pricing narrative as "available upon request" outside template structure
3. Document the approach in DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative) for transparency

## Considerations

### Estimating Factors for Schedule A Pricing

When developing Schedule A pricing, the estimator/commercial lead should consider:

| Factor | Description | Source/Rationale |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Scope removals (Addendum 03)** | Pickled sand storage building removed; do not price this element | Addendum 03 section 1.2; failure to exclude may result in non-competitive pricing |
| **Scope additions (Addendum 03)** | New requirements added: 16 ft OH doors, bay sumps, fire exhaust systems, generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof, 40 bunker gear lockers | Addendum 03 sections 1.8, 1.10, 1.12, 1.13, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17; failure to include may result in non-compliant proposal |
| **Service tie-in allowance decision** | Option to use cash allowance for water, wastewater, electrical, communication, gas tie-ins | Addendum 03 section 1.7; decision impacts base price competitiveness vs risk allocation |
| **Site area clarification** | Developable site is 12 acres (not 20 acres); 8 acres are dog park/storm pond in flood fringe | Addendum 03 section 1.1; affects site work quantities and costs |
| **Survey provision** | Survey files will be provided after contract award (not before) | Addendum 03 section 1.20; may affect estimating assumptions for site work |
| **Room sizing flexibility** | Many rooms do not have prescribed dimensions; sample ranges provided in Addendum 03 section 1.21 | Allows design optimization but requires estimator assumptions; document in pricing narrative |
| **Schedule flexibility** | Project is NOT schedule-driven; proponents encouraged to optimize schedule for cost reduction | RFP Section 2.4 (page 8); may enable value engineering or off-season construction pricing |
| **Bond cost inclusion** | 50% Performance + 50% Labour/Material Payment bonds must be included in base price | RFP Section 5.3.1.3 (page 15); typically 1-3% of contract value; **ASSUMPTION:** standard bond rates apply |
| **Overhead and profit caps** | Change order markup limited to 20% (under $50k) or 15% ($50k+) | Appendix J SC40 (page 68); does not affect initial pricing but informs risk/contingency strategy |

### Addenda Impact Summary (Lensing: B-008)

For comprehensive addenda account beyond pricing impacts:

| Addendum | Content Reviewed | Pricing Impact Assessment |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Addendum 01** | Bidders meeting date confirmation; program dimension flexibility clarification | No pricing impact — scheduling and flexibility confirmation only |
| **Addendum 02** | RFP pagination inquiry; confirmation no pages missing | No pricing impact — formatting clarification only |
| **Addendum 03** | Scope changes, technical requirements, site clarifications | **CRITICAL PRICING IMPACTS** — see Datasheet and Considerations above |

## Trade-offs

### Competitive Positioning vs Risk Coverage

**Trade-off:** Lower pricing increases competitiveness (price = 35 points) but increases risk if scope is underestimated.

**Considerations:**
- **Aggressive pricing strategy:** Minimize contingencies; rely on change order process for unknowns
  - **Risk:** May expose Design-Builder to losses if scope gaps emerge
  - **Benefit:** Maximizes price score; increases win probability

- **Conservative pricing strategy:** Include robust contingencies for scope uncertainties
  - **Risk:** May result in non-competitive pricing; reduces win probability
  - **Benefit:** Protects Design-Builder from cost overruns

**Guidance:**
- Review OSR and addenda carefully to understand scope boundaries
- Price all explicitly stated requirements in base contract
- Use cash allowances where permitted (service tie-ins) to manage uncertainty transparently
- Document all assumptions in pricing narrative (DEL-05-03) to support change order claims if needed

**Source context:** RFP Section 8.5 (page 28) best-value evaluation; CCDC 14-2013 change order provisions (Appendix J SC40-43, pages 68-69)

**Note (Lensing: A-009):** This trade-off discussion is qualitative but lacks a structured decision framework for balancing price vs technical merit. **TBD:** Commercial lead should establish risk appetite thresholds (e.g., minimum acceptable contingency margin) (Lensing: B-011).

---

### Service Tie-In Allowance vs Firm Price

**Trade-off:** Addendum 03 section 1.7 permits cash allowance for service tie-ins, but does not require it.

**Option A: Use cash allowance approach**
- **Benefit:** Reduces estimating risk for unknown service connection costs; shifts risk to Owner
- **Risk:** May be perceived as less complete or less committed pricing by Evaluation Committee
- **Approach:** Include cash allowance line in Schedule B; document in pricing narrative

**Option B: Provide firm pricing for service tie-ins**
- **Benefit:** Demonstrates completeness and commitment; may score higher on certainty
- **Risk:** Estimator assumes cost risk for unknowns (exact tie-in locations, depths, utility company requirements)
- **Approach:** Include estimated tie-in costs in Public Services Sitework line of Schedule B

**Guidance:** This is a commercial decision for the estimator/proposal manager. If service tie-in details are insufficient to estimate confidently, use the allowance approach and document the rationale. If confident, provide firm pricing to strengthen the proposal.

**Source:** Addendum 03 section 1.7 (page 3)

---

### Base Scope vs Additional Options Strategy

**Trade-off:** Some scope items could be interpreted as base requirements or optional enhancements.

**Clarity from RFP:**
- **Mandatory in base:** All items in OSR Appendix A and Functional Program Appendix B (as modified by addenda)
- **Explicitly optional (Additional Options 1-6):** Wash bay, yard lighting, access control, security/cameras, signage (branding), appliances

**Gray area — FF&E treatment:**
- Addendum 03 section 1.18 states: "FF&E can be included as an additional item in the proposal but should not be included in the base costs so the evaluation team can accurately evaluate the construction of the building."
- **Guidance:** Treat FF&E as separate additional item (beyond the 6 listed options) or clarify in pricing narrative that it is excluded from base and available upon request

**Source:** RFP Section 12 (pages 44-45) Additional Optional Items; Addendum 03 section 1.18 (page 4)

**TBD (Lensing: D-005):** Should the pricing team assess whether all 6 additional options are worth pricing, or is the assumption that all must be priced? RFP may not require all options to have non-zero values. Consult RFP requirements for optional items.

---

### Pricing Transparency vs Competitive Advantage

**Trade-off:** Schedule B requires detailed cost breakdown, which reveals estimating methodology and margins.

**Consideration:**
- **RFP requires transparency:** Schedule B must show General Requirements, Buildings, Sitework breakdown (page 59)
- **Competitive concern:** Detailed breakdown exposes markup structure and cost assumptions
- **Mitigation:** Provide breakdown at the level required by template; avoid excessive detail that reveals proprietary estimating methods

**Guidance:** Complete Schedule B as required (three main lines: General Requirements, Buildings, Sitework) plus breakdown of each additional option. Use pricing narrative to explain high-level assumptions without disclosing proprietary unit costs or subcontractor quotes.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H Schedule B template (page 59)

## Examples

### Example 1: Addenda Acknowledgment Section (compliant)

```
Addenda:

The Proponent acknowledges that they have received the following Addenda and have
accounted for their contents in their Total Stipulated Price above:

Addendum 01 to Addendum 03
```

**Why this works:**
- Lists addenda range (01 to 03)
- Uses exact template language from RFP page 57
- Confirms contents accounted for in pricing

**Note (Lensing: B-007):** Verify that "Addendum 01 to Addendum 03" format exactly matches template blank format. If template has two separate blanks ("Addendum ___ to ___"), confirm the fill-in format is correct.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H Schedule A template (page 57)

---

### Example 2: Base Contract Scope Statement (from pricing narrative)

**ASSUMPTION:** The following would appear in DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative) to support Schedule A line 1-1:

```
Base Contract Scope (Schedule A line 1-1):

Includes:
- Main building (Fire Hall + Public Works combined facility) per OSR Appendix A
- Cold storage building (60' x 100') per OSR
- Site work for 12-acre functional site (Addendum 03 clarification)
- All requirements from Addendum 03: 16 ft OH doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus
  exhaust (2 apparatus/bay), backup generator, water fill stations (2" min, one
  per department), solar-capable roof, 40 bunker gear lockers
- Performance bond (50%) and Labour/Material Payment bond (50%)
- Design, engineering, permitting, project management (General Requirements)

Excludes:
- Pickled sand storage building (removed per Addendum 03 section 1.2)
- FF&E (available as separate additional item upon request)
- Additional Options 1-6 (priced separately in Schedule A lines 1-2 through 1-7)

Cash Allowances:
- Service tie-ins (water, wastewater, electrical, communication, gas): $[TBD]
  (permitted per Addendum 03 section 1.7)
```

**Rationale:** This scope statement provides transparency and demonstrates addenda integration, supporting Schedule A credibility.

### Example 3: Reconciliation Check Table

**ASSUMPTION:** The following check would be performed pre-submission:

| Line Item | Schedule A Value | Schedule B Source | Match? |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Base (1-1) | $[TBD] | Subtotal Base Requirements (Schedule B) | ✓ / ✗ |
| Option 1 (1-2) | $[TBD] | Additional Item 1 subtotal | ✓ / ✗ |
| Option 2 (1-3) | $[TBD] | Additional Item 2 subtotal | ✓ / ✗ |
| Option 3 (1-4) | $[TBD] | Additional Item 3 subtotal | ✓ / ✗ |
| Option 4 (1-5) | $[TBD] | Additional Item 4 subtotal (excluding monitoring fee if separated) | ✓ / ✗ |
| Option 5 (1-6) | $[TBD] | Additional Item 5 subtotal | ✓ / ✗ |
| Option 6 (1-7) | $[TBD] | Additional Item 6 subtotal | ✓ / ✗ |

**Purpose:** Ensures R-03.1 and R-03.2 (reconciliation requirements) are satisfied before submission.

**Source:** Acceptance criteria (_CONTEXT.md); RFP Appendix H note (page 57)

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

### Conflict-01: FF&E Treatment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Conflict ID** | CONFLICT-01 |
| **Conflict** | Addendum 03 permits FF&E as additional item, but Schedule A template only provides 6 additional option lines (1-2 through 1-7); FF&E is not one of the 6 named options |
| **Source A** | Addendum 03 section 1.18 (page 4): "FF&E can be included as an additional item in the proposal but should not be included in the base costs" |
| **Source B** | RFP Appendix H Schedule A (page 57): Only 6 additional options listed (wash bay, yard lighting, access control, security/cameras, signage, appliances) |
| **Impacted sections** | Schedule A pricing structure; pricing narrative scope clarifications |
| **Proposed authority (PROPOSAL)** | Treat FF&E as mentioned in pricing narrative (DEL-05-03) as "available upon request" but not priced in Schedule A unless Owner issues clarification to add a 7th line |
| **Human ruling** | **TBD** — Commercial lead to decide: (1) exclude FF&E and note in narrative, (2) request clarification from RFP Authority, or (3) propose FF&E pricing in narrative outside Schedule A template |

---

### Conflict-02: Security Monitoring Fee Presentation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Conflict ID** | CONFLICT-02 |
| **Conflict** | Schedule B separates "Monthly Monitoring Fee" for security cameras, but Schedule A line 1-5 does not distinguish between installation and ongoing monitoring costs |
| **Source A** | RFP Appendix H Schedule B (page 59): "Monthly Monitoring Fee $____" as separate line under Additional Item 4 |
| **Source B** | RFP Appendix H Schedule A (page 57): Line 1-5 "Pricing Additional Option 4: Design-Builder Base Contract (Schedule B) Security and Camera System" — single lump sum line |
| **Impacted sections** | Schedule A line 1-5 interpretation; Schedule B reconciliation |
| **Proposed authority (PROPOSAL)** | Schedule A line 1-5 should reflect **installation cost only** (one-time capital cost); monthly monitoring fee documented in Schedule B but not added to Schedule A line 1-5 (since it is a recurring operational cost, not capital cost). Clarify in pricing narrative. |
| **Human ruling** | **TBD** — Commercial lead to confirm interpretation or seek RFP Authority clarification |

**Note:** This conflict highlights ambiguity in how to reconcile Schedule A (summary) with Schedule B (detail) when one option includes both capital and operational cost components.

---

## Notes

- **Best practice:** Have a second reviewer (proposal manager or QA lead) verify Schedule A completeness and reconciliation to Schedule B before final PDF assembly
- **Timing consideration:** Schedule A is typically finalized **after** Schedule B is complete, since Schedule A summarizes Schedule B
- **Addenda tracking:** Maintain addenda log (likely in DEL-01-01 Compliance Matrix) to ensure all addenda are acknowledged in Schedule A
- **ASSUMPTION:** If proponent has received additional addenda beyond 01, 02, 03, they must also be acknowledged in the addenda section; this guidance assumes only three addenda as of decomposition date (2026-02-04)

### Verification Philosophy (Lensing: X-001)

**Foundational Directive:** Verification for Schedule A should be **compliance-focused** rather than exhaustive, given:
- Template-driven format with limited complexity
- Critical compliance items (addenda acknowledgment) are binary pass/fail
- Mathematical reconciliation is exact-match verification
- Time constraints require efficient verification approach

**Verification Intensity:**
| Check Type | Intensity | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Addenda acknowledgment | **CRITICAL** — full verification | Disqualification risk |
| Mathematical reconciliation | **HIGH** — exact match required | Acceptance criteria |
| Form completeness | **MEDIUM** — visual inspection | Clear pass/fail |
| Scope exclusions/inclusions | **MEDIUM** — cross-check to Schedule B | Delegated verification |

### Schedule A Line Structure Rationale (Lensing: B-010)

**TBD:** Why does Schedule A use 7 lines specifically? Understanding the structure rationale would inform gray-area decisions:
- **ASSUMPTION:** Line structure aligns with RFP evaluation methodology (base vs optional scope separation)
- **ASSUMPTION:** 6 options represent Owner-prioritized scope that may be selected post-award
- Consult RFP Authority if rationale is needed for decisions about non-template optional items (e.g., FF&E)
