## Scope

### In Scope

This deliverable covers the completion of **Appendix H Schedule A** pricing summary for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal, including:

1. **Base contract pricing** (line item 1-1): Total fixed price for design and construction of the Public Services Building (main building + cold storage building) and associated site work, excluding additional options
2. **Six additional options** (line items 1-2 through 1-7): Separately priced optional scope items
3. **Tax treatment:** Taxes calculated and shown separately from contract amounts
4. **Addenda acknowledgment:** Formal acknowledgment that all addenda have been received and incorporated into pricing

**Source:** RFP Section 4.3 (page 13); RFP Appendix H Schedule A template (page 57); _CONTEXT.md description

### Out of Scope

The following are **not** included in this deliverable:

1. **Schedule B detailed cost breakdown** — covered by DEL-05-02
2. **Pricing narrative and assumptions** — covered by DEL-05-03
3. **Cost estimating and buildup activities** — these are inputs to Schedule A, not outputs
4. **Pickled sand storage building pricing** — removed from project scope per Addendum 03 section 1.2
5. **Service tie-in detailed costs** — may be treated as cash allowance per Addendum 03 section 1.7

| **R-01.2** | All seven pricing line items (1-1 through 1-7) shall be completed with dollar values or marked if not priced | Visual inspection: no blank pricing lines without explanation | RFP Appendix H Schedule A (page 57) |
| **R-01.3** | Dollar symbol ($) shall be used consistently with pricing values | Visual inspection: currency symbols present. **Clarification:** Pass/fail criteria = missing symbol on ANY line is failure (Lensing: A-004) | RFP Appendix H template convention (page 57) |

| **R-01.5** | **TBD:** Is there a minimum compliance threshold for Schedule A? (e.g., is partial completion of lines acceptable or must all 7 lines have dollar values?) | Consult RFP evaluation criteria for pass/fail threshold (Lensing: C-001) | RFP evaluation criteria — verify |
| **R-01.6** | **TBD:** Does RFP require disclosure of cost estimating methodology within Schedule A itself, or only in Schedule B/pricing narrative? | Verify against RFP Appendix H template (Lensing: B-006) | RFP Appendix H |

## Verification

### Pre-Submission Verification Checklist

**Note (Lensing: X-005):** This Specification verification checklist is **authoritative**. Procedure verification (quality gates and Step 9 checklist) should implement all items in this checklist. If discrepancies exist between Specification and Procedure verification items, Specification requirements take precedence.

| Verification Item | Check Method | Requirement Reference |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Form completeness** | All 7 pricing lines filled in; addenda section completed | R-01.2, R-04.1 |
| **Mathematical reconciliation** | Schedule A totals = Schedule B totals (base and each option) | R-03.1, R-03.2 |
| **Scope exclusions applied** | Pickled sand building NOT in base price; service tie-ins treated per allowance approach decision | R-06.1, R-06.2 |
| **Addenda integration** | Pricing reflects all Addendum 03 scope changes (removed scope, added requirements) | R-04.2, R-06.1 |
| **Tax separation** | Taxes shown on separate line(s), not embedded in contract prices | R-02.5 |
| **Bond cost inclusion** | Bond costs included in base pricing (verify in Schedule B General Requirements or separate line) | R-02.3 |
| **Signature and execution** | Authorized signature present; corporate seal if applicable | R-05.1, R-05.2 |
| **PDF assembly** | Schedule A included in proposal PDF; total PDF under 15 MB | R-01.4 |
| **R-07 verification** | Additional options (lines 1-2 through 1-7) priced per R-07.1 through R-07.4 requirements | R-07.1, R-07.2, R-07.3, R-07.4 (Lensing: X-006) |

### Post-Submission Verification (Evaluation Phase)

**ASSUMPTION:** Evaluation Committee will verify (Lensing: X-008 — these are assumptions about Owner behavior, not validated requirements):

1. **Compliance:** Schedule A completed per requirements (pass/fail gate)
2. **Reconciliation:** Schedule A and Schedule B totals match
3. **Pricing competitiveness:** Price score assigned per evaluation matrix (RFP Section 8.3, page 26)
4. **Addenda acknowledgment:** All addenda acknowledged (failure may disqualify)

**Source basis:** RFP Section 8.1-8.2 (pages 25-26)

**Note (Lensing: F-008):** This section presents assumptions about Owner evaluation behavior and is not formulated as proponent-controlled requirements. Consider either elevating to requirement status with verification method or explicitly labeling as "Owner Actions (Not Proponent Requirements)."

## Notes

- **Terminology clarification:** RFP uses "Additional Option" in Schedule A (lines 1-2 through 1-7) and "Additional Item" in Schedule B for the same six optional scope elements. This is an RFP template convention; both terms are equivalent.
- **TBD:** Specific dollar amounts for each pricing line (determined by estimator from Schedule B buildup)
- **TBD:** Tax calculation methodology (GST-only or GST+PST; rates; treatment of design vs construction components)
- **TBD:** Decision on whether to use cash allowance for service tie-ins (permitted per Addendum 03 section 1.7 but not required)
- **ASSUMPTION:** Schedule A pricing lines are lump sum values; unit pricing not required by template
- **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ITEM:** Addenda acknowledgment section is mandatory and may result in disqualification if incomplete (RFP page 57 warning note)
