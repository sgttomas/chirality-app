## Construction

### Price Assembly Logic

**ASSUMPTION:** Standard Design-Build pricing structure follows this hierarchy:

1. **Base contract scope** (line 1-1) comprises:
   - General requirements (design, engineering, bonding, project management, etc.)
   - Main building construction (all disciplines)
   - Cold storage building construction
   - Site work and civil works (excluding service tie-ins if using allowance approach)
   - All mandatory requirements from OSR
   - Bond costs (50% performance + 50% labour/material payment bonds)

   **Source basis:** RFP Appendix H Schedule B breakdown structure (page 59); Addendum 03 scope clarifications

2. **Additional options** (lines 1-2 through 1-7) are priced separately:
   - Each option is independent and can be selected or not selected by Owner
   - Options priced as incremental cost above base

   **Source:** RFP Section 8.5 (page 28); Appendix H Schedule A structure (page 57)

3. **Taxes** calculated on subtotals and shown separately

   **Source:** RFP Section 4.3 (page 13)

### Addenda Integration Requirements

| Addendum | Impact on Schedule A Pricing | Source |
|----------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Addendum 01** | Confirms bidders meeting date (no pricing impact); confirms program dimensions intentionally flexible | Addendum 01 (decomposition summary Section 4) |
| **Addendum 02** | Confirms no missing RFP pages (no pricing impact) | Addendum 02 (decomposition summary Section 4) |
| **Addendum 03** | **CRITICAL IMPACTS:** (1) Pickled sand storage building REMOVED from base scope; (2) 12-acre developable site (not full 20 acres); (3) Service tie-ins may use allowance; (4) Added requirements: 16 ft OH doors, bay sumps, fire exhaust (2 apparatus/bay), generator, fill stations (2"), solar-capable roof, 40 bunker gear lockers, room sizing ranges. **Note:** Cold storage building (60' x 100') dimensions should be verified unchanged by Addendum 03 (Lensing: B-009). | Addendum 03 sections 1.1-1.21 (pages 1-5) |

**Addenda to acknowledge in Schedule A:** Addendum 01, 02, 03

**Source:** RFP Section 2.9 (page 11); Appendix H addenda acknowledgment requirement (page 57)

## Notes

- **Terminology note:** Schedule A uses "Additional Option" (lines 1-2 through 1-7) while Schedule B uses "Additional Item" for the same scope elements. Both terms refer to the six optional items that can be selected by the Owner. **Normalization:** Adopt "Additional Option" for Schedule A context, "Additional Item" for Schedule B context; note equivalence once (Lensing: B-005).
- **TBD:** Actual dollar values for pricing lines (these are to be determined by estimator based on detailed cost buildup in Schedule B)
- **TBD:** Specific tax rates and treatment (GST applicability, provincial tax considerations) — requires commercial lead input
- **TBD:** Treatment of design fees, engineering fees, and other soft costs within General Requirements line of Schedule B
- Schedule A is a **summary document**; detailed cost buildup is in Schedule B (see DEL-05-02)
- Addenda acknowledgment is **mandatory** and failure to complete may result in price proposal disqualification per RFP note on page 57
