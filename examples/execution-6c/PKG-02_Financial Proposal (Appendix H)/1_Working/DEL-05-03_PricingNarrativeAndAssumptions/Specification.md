# Specification: DEL-05-03 Pricing Narrative and Assumptions

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable provides the pricing narrative that:
- Explains the basis and assumptions underlying Appendix H Schedules A and B
- Acknowledges integration of all addenda (01, 02, 03) into pricing
- Clarifies allowances for items with uncertain scope or cost at proposal stage
- Documents exclusions from base pricing
- Explains treatment of Additional Options 1–6
- Presents value alternatives or optimization ideas (if applicable) in a manner that does not undermine base compliance

**Source:** Decomposition §8 DEL-05-03; _CONTEXT.md description and acceptance criteria.

### Out of Scope
This deliverable does **not**:
- Include the numerical pricing itself (that is in DEL-05-01 Schedule A and DEL-05-02 Schedule B)
- Provide detailed cost breakdowns by trade (that belongs in Schedule B)
- Include design narratives or technical methodology (those are in PKG-04, PKG-05, PKG-06)
- Address team qualifications (that is in PKG-03)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on deliverable type (narrative supporting numerical schedules).

### Boundary Conditions
| Boundary | Interface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Upstream from Schedules A & B** | This narrative must be consistent with DEL-05-01 and DEL-05-02 | Dependencies coordinated externally (_DEPENDENCIES.md: NOT_TRACKED) |
| **Informed by addenda** | All pricing impacts from Addenda 01, 02, 03 must be reflected | Decomposition §4 integration summary |
| **Informed by site due diligence** | Pricing assumptions should reference site reports where relevant | Decomposition §10 SOW-025 (geotech, wetlands, enviro, flood, grading) |
| **Aligned with design concept** | Assumptions must be compatible with DEL-02-01 concept and technical narratives | **ASSUMPTION**: cross-package consistency required for credibility |

## Requirements

### R-1: Addenda Integration and Acknowledgement
**Requirement:** The narrative must explicitly acknowledge integration of Addenda 01, 02, and 03, and summarize their impacts on pricing.

**Rationale:** RFP §2.9 and C-07 state that failure to acknowledge addenda may disqualify the price proposal.

**Source:** Decomposition §3 C-07; §4 Addenda Integration Summary.

**Source Validation Note:** **TBD — Verify RFP §2.9 or contract terms**: Does RFP explicitly state that failure to acknowledge addenda disqualifies the proposal? If yes, R-1 is irreducible obligation. If no, reframe R-1 as best practice recommendation. [**LENSING F-001**]

**Verification:** Cross-check narrative against addenda log; confirm acknowledgment statement present.

**Acceptance Criteria:** [**LENSING A-002**]
1. All three addenda (01, 02, 03) explicitly named in narrative
2. Addendum 03 impacts fully documented:
   - Site area 12-acre basis stated
   - Pickled sand building exclusion stated
   - FF&E treatment clarified (per OI-004 decision)
   - Technical requirements listed (overhead doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar readiness)
   - Allowance approach stated
3. All statements traceable to addendum text or Decomposition §4

---

### R-2: Scope Exclusions — Pickled Sand Storage Building
**Requirement:** The narrative must state that the pickled sand storage building is **excluded** from this proposal scope (to be issued as separate RFP per Addendum 03).

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 removed this building from the RFP scope.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03 Key Impacts; CHG-003.

**Verification:** Confirm exclusion statement present in narrative; confirm Schedule A and B do not include costs for this building.

---

### R-3: Allowances — Site Servicing Tie-Ins
**Requirement:** The narrative must clarify the allowance approach for site servicing tie-in costs, noting that tie-ins are **not required** to be fully priced in the proposal.

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 permits an allowance approach for service tie-ins.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; OI-003 (closed).

**Verification:** Confirm allowance item and value (if specified) are stated; confirm Schedule B includes corresponding allowance line item (or note that specific value is TBD).

---

### R-4: FF&E Treatment
**Requirement:** The narrative must clarify how Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment (FF&E) is handled: may be included as an **additional item**, **not** in base cost.

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 clarifies FF&E may be presented separately.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; §5 vocab (FF&E); OI-004 (open issue).

**Verification:** Confirm FF&E handling statement present; if FF&E is priced, confirm it appears as a separate line (not embedded in base).

**Status:** OI-004 remains open — estimator must decide scope and pricing treatment.

**Decision Required:** [**LENSING C-001**] Close OI-004 before narrative production:
- **Option A:** FF&E priced as separate Schedule A line item (specify scope)
- **Option B:** FF&E excluded with rationale documented
- **Option C:** FF&E included in base cost (justify deviation from Addendum 03)

Once decided, update both Specification R-4 and Datasheet.md Conditions to be consistent.

---

### R-5: Additional Options (1–6) Pricing Basis
**Requirement:** The narrative must explain the pricing basis for each of the six Additional Options:
1. Built-in wash bay
2. Yard lighting
3. Building access control
4. Security/cameras (+ monitoring fee separated)
5. Exterior signage (branding)
6. Appliances

**Rationale:** RFP Appendix H Schedule A requires separate pricing for each option; evaluators need to understand scope and assumptions for each.

**Source:** Decomposition §5 vocab (Additional Options); §8 DEL-05-01.

**Verification:** Confirm narrative addresses each option; confirm monitoring fee (Option 4) is separated in Schedule B per requirement.

**Detail:** **TBD** — specific scope descriptions and pricing assumptions for each option require estimator input.

**Additional Options Template:** [**LENSING B-004**] Use the following template structure for each option in the narrative:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Option Name** | [e.g., Option 1: Built-in Wash Bay] |
| **Scope Description** | [What is included in this option? Size, features, equipment] |
| **Pricing Basis** | [Market quote? Estimate? Allowance? State source of pricing] |
| **Contingency/Margin** | [If applicable, state contingency treatment] |
| **Monitoring Fee Separation** | [For Option 4 only: Confirm monitoring fee is separated in Schedule B] |

---

### R-6: Value Alternatives Must Not Undermine Compliance
**Requirement:** If value alternatives or optimization ideas are presented (SOW-028), they must be listed **separately** and must **not** undermine compliance with base mandatory requirements.

**Rationale:** RFP §8.5 allows alternatives but base proposal must stand alone.

**Source:** Decomposition §10 SOW-028; Scope Ledger notes.

**Verification:** Confirm any value alternatives are presented as optional/supplementary; confirm base proposal remains fully compliant without them.

---

### R-7: Pricing Assumptions Transparency
**Requirement:** The narrative must document key estimating assumptions, including:
- Market pricing date and escalation assumptions (if applicable)
- Labor and material availability assumptions
- Site access and logistics assumptions
- Procurement lead time assumptions
- Contingency approach (magnitude and rationale)
- Survey files timing (available after award per Addendum 03)

**Rationale:** Transparent assumptions support credibility and provide basis for post-award cost discussions if conditions change.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on standard estimating practice and Decomposition §4 Addendum 03 (survey files after award).

**Source Validation Note:** [**LENSING D-001**] This requirement is sourced as ASSUMPTION. Validate RFP source for pricing assumptions transparency requirement. If RFP clause does not exist, reframe as "best practice recommendation" rather than "requirement." Mark confidence level for source citation.

**Evidence Inventory Requirement:** [**LENSING B-002**] Document which pricing assumptions are based on:
- **Firm evidence:** Vendor quotes, site reports, published standards
- **Preliminary estimates:** Based on comparable projects or parametric data
- **Professional judgment:** Estimator experience without documented source

For each major cost category (general requirements, building, sitework, options), state evidence availability status.

**Verification:** Confirm assumptions section present in narrative; confirm assumptions are consistent with schedule (DEL-08-01) and site due diligence (DEL-09-02).

**Adjudicative Standard for Assumption Quality:** [**LENSING X-004**] Each assumption must state:
1. **Value or range** — Specific figure or acceptable range
2. **Source** — Quote, report, standard, or professional judgment
3. **Confidence level** — Firm / Preliminary / Estimated
4. **Adjustment trigger** — What post-award information will finalize the value (if uncertain)

Assess each assumption against these four criteria during verification.

**Detail:** **TBD** — specific assumption values and rationales require estimator input.

---

### R-8: Consistency with Schedules A and B
**Requirement:** All allowance values, exclusions, and additional option descriptions in the narrative must be **consistent** with the corresponding line items in Schedule A (DEL-05-01) and Schedule B (DEL-05-02).

**Rationale:** Inconsistencies between narrative and schedules undermine credibility and may trigger clarification requests or scoring penalties.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on standard proposal quality requirements.

**Source Validation Note:** [**LENSING D-001**] This requirement is sourced as ASSUMPTION. Validate RFP source for consistency requirement. If RFP clause does not exist, reframe as "best practice recommendation."

**Verification:** Cross-check narrative statements against Schedule A and B line items; flag any discrepancies for resolution.

**Status:** Cross-check deferred to Pass 2 (cross-reference consistency check) and WORKING_ITEMS sessions.

---

### R-9: Technical Requirements Reflected in Pricing Basis
**Requirement:** The narrative should acknowledge that pricing reflects the technical requirements clarified in Addendum 03:
- Overhead doors (16 ft height)
- Bay sumps
- Fire apparatus exhaust systems
- Generator (sized to support Incident Command Post)
- Fill stations
- Solar-capable roof and orientation

**Rationale:** These are specific scope items clarified by Addendum 03 that affect cost.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03 Key Impacts; §5 vocab (ICP).

**Source Validation Note:** [**LENSING D-001**] This requirement is sourced as ASSUMPTION based on standard proposal quality. Validate that RFP or evaluation criteria explicitly require acknowledgment of technical requirements in pricing narrative.

**Verification:** Confirm narrative references these technical items as included in base scope and pricing.

**Detail:** **TBD** — specific cost impacts or line-item mappings require estimator input.

---

### R-10: Developable Site Area Basis
**Requirement:** The narrative should state that site development pricing is based on the **12-acre developable area** (20 acres total parcel; 8 acres allocated to dog park/storm pond in flood fringe).

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 clarified the functional site area; this affects sitework scope and cost.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; CHG-003.

**Verification:** Confirm narrative references 12-acre developable site as basis for sitework pricing.

## Standards

### Governing Standards
| Standard / Code | Applicability | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RFP 2024_004 Section 4.2–4.3 | Proposal submission format and structure | Decomposition §3 C-01, C-02 |
| RFP 2024_004 Section 8.5 | Pricing proposal requirements | Decomposition references (location TBD) |
| RFP 2024_004 Appendix H | Financial proposal templates (Schedule A, Schedule B) | Decomposition §3 C-05; §8 DEL-05-01, DEL-05-02 |
| Addenda 01, 02, 03 (integrated) | Scope clarifications and pricing impacts | Decomposition §4; _REFERENCES.md |

**Note:** Specific RFP section references require validation against source PDF (location TBD pending access).

**Evaluation Structure Clarification Needed:** [**LENSING E-001**] The normative weight of this narrative depends on RFP evaluation structure:
- **If narrative is scored as sub-category** of 35-point "Price" category (e.g., Narrative 15 pts, Schedules 20 pts), then disclosure fidelity is irreducible — narrative quality directly affects score.
- **If narrative is support document only** (no separate score), then it is advisory/compliance support — requirements R-7 through R-10 may be "should" rather than "must."

**Action Required:** Verify RFP evaluation rubric. Update Specification language (must vs. should) based on findings.

## Verification

### Verification Methods
| Requirement | Verification Method | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| R-1 (Addenda acknowledgement) | Document review | Explicit acknowledgement statement present; impacts summarized |
| R-2 (Pickled sand exclusion) | Document review + cross-check to Schedules A/B | Exclusion stated; no costs in schedules for this building |
| R-3 (Site servicing allowance) | Document review + cross-check to Schedule B | Allowance approach explained; line item present (or TBD noted) |
| R-4 (FF&E treatment) | Document review + cross-check to Schedules A/B | Treatment stated; if priced, appears as separate line |
| R-5 (Additional Options basis) | Document review + cross-check to Schedules A/B | Each option addressed; monitoring fee separated |
| R-6 (Value alternatives compliant) | Document review | Alternatives (if any) presented as optional; base compliant standalone |
| R-7 (Assumptions transparency) | Document review + cross-check to schedule/due diligence + adjudicative standard check [**LENSING X-004**] | Assumptions documented; consistent with DEL-08-01, DEL-09-02; each assumption has value/range, source, confidence, adjustment trigger |
| R-8 (Consistency with schedules) | Cross-document comparison | No discrepancies between narrative and Schedule A/B |
| R-9 (Technical requirements acknowledged) | Document review | Technical items from Addendum 03 referenced in pricing basis |
| R-10 (12-acre developable site) | Document review | Site area basis stated |

### Verification Responsibility
- **Primary:** Estimator / Commercial Lead (deliverable owner)
- **Cross-check:** Proposal Manager (PKG-01 compliance matrix owner)
- **Final QA:** **TBD — Assign Final QA Authority** [**LENSING F-002**]
  - Suggest: Proposal Manager or Commercial Director
  - This person is accountable for sign-off that narrative meets RFP requirements and evaluation criteria before submission
  - An irreducible obligation requires that someone with authority is accountable for verification; TBD means no one currently owns this

### Holistic Coherence Verification [**LENSING D-003**]
In addition to item-by-item requirement verification, perform a holistic coherence test at Step 7 (Final Review):
- Does the narrative tell a coherent story about cost drivers, assumptions, and trade-offs?
- Are contradictions between sections identified and resolved?
- Does narrative support the price in Schedules A/B with a defensible logic chain?
- Would an evaluator find the assumptions collectively credible?

**Coherence Rubric:**
| Criterion | PASS | FAIL |
|---|---|---|
| Internal consistency | No contradictory statements between narrative sections | Contradictory assumptions or scope statements exist |
| Schedule alignment | Assumptions consistent with DEL-08-01 timeline | Durations or procurement assumptions conflict with schedule |
| Design alignment | Pricing basis consistent with DEL-02-01 concept | Building size, systems, or scope conflict with concept |
| Risk register alignment | Aggressive assumptions flagged in DEL-09-01 | Risks identified but not linked to risk register |

## Documentation

### Required Documentation
1. **Pricing Narrative and Assumptions document** (this deliverable) — integrated into proposal PDF financial section
2. **Cross-reference log** (informal) — tracking consistency between narrative and Schedules A/B during production
3. **Addenda integration checklist** — confirming all pricing impacts from addenda are reflected

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on standard proposal production practices.

### Documentation Responsibility
- Estimator / Commercial Lead produces narrative
- Proposal Manager integrates into final PDF and validates compliance
- **TBD**: Final sign-off authority

---

**Note:** Requirements marked **TBD** require estimator input and validation against RFP source documents. Cross-document consistency checks (R-8) will be performed in Pass 2 after all four documents are drafted.
