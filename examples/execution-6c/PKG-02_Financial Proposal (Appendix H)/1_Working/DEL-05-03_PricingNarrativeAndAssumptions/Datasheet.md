## Identification

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Deliverable ID** | DEL-05-03 |
| **Name** | PricingNarrativeAndAssumptions |
| **Type** | Narrative Document |
| **Package** | PKG-02 — Financial Proposal (Appendix H) |
| **Discipline** | Commercial / Estimating |
| **Responsible** | Estimator / Commercial Lead |
| **Status** | INITIALIZED |
| **Version** | Draft (4_DOCUMENTS Pass 1) |

## Attributes

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Document Purpose** | Explain pricing assumptions, allowances, exclusions, and addenda impacts that underpin Appendix H Schedules A & B | Decomposition §8 DEL-05-03; _CONTEXT.md |
| **Primary Audience** | Town of Penhold evaluation committee; commercial/estimating reviewers | **ASSUMPTION**: Standard RFP evaluation structure |
| **Submission Format** | Narrative section within proposal PDF (integrated with financial section) | RFP §4.2–4.3 (location TBD); _CONTEXT.md |
| **Related Schedules** | Appendix H Schedule A (pricing summary), Schedule B (cost breakdown) | Decomposition §8 DEL-05-01, DEL-05-02 |
| **Scope Items Addressed** | SOW-028 (pricing alternatives / value-optimization ideas listed separately) | Decomposition §9, §10 |
| **Evaluation Weight** | Part of 35-point Proposal Price category | Decomposition §15 Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk |
| **Evaluation Weight Detail** | **TBD — Verify RFP evaluation rubric**: Does RFP score "Price" as 35 points total (undifferentiated between narrative and schedules), or is there a sub-rubric (e.g., Schedules 20 pts, Narrative 15 pts)? If narrative quality is independently scored, level of detail and defensibility required may differ. | **LENSING B-001**: Essential fact needed to understand evaluator expectations |

## Conditions

### Mandatory Compliance Conditions
| Condition | Requirement | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Addenda Acknowledgement** | All three addenda (01, 02, 03) must be acknowledged; failure may disqualify price proposal | Decomposition §3 C-07; §4 |
| **Scope Exclusions** | Pickled sand storage building removed from this RFP (separate RFP to follow) | Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; CHG-003 |
| **Allowance Treatment** | Site servicing tie-in costs: allowance approach permitted; tie-ins not required in proposal pricing | Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; OI-003 (closed) |
| **FF&E Treatment** | FF&E may be included as an additional item, **not** in base cost. **Note:** OI-004 remains open — this condition requires decision before narrative can be finalized. Options: (A) FF&E priced as separate Schedule A line item with scope defined, (B) FF&E excluded with rationale documented, (C) FF&E included in base cost with deviation justification per Addendum 03. Once decided, align with Specification R-4. | Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; §5 vocab (FF&E); OI-004 (open); **LENSING C-001** |
| **Additional Options** | Six Additional Options (1–6) must be priced: 1) Built-in wash bay, 2) Yard lighting, 3) Building access control, 4) Security/cameras + monitoring fee, 5) Exterior signage, 6) Appliances | Decomposition §5 vocab; §8 DEL-05-01 |
| **Value Alternatives** | Must not undermine base compliance | Decomposition §10 SOW-028 |

### Design Basis Conditions
| Condition | Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Developable Site Area** | 12-acre functional site (20 acres total; 8 acres dog park/storm pond in flood fringe) | Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; CHG-003 |
| **Technical Requirements** | Overhead doors (16 ft), bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof/orientation | Decomposition §4 Addendum 03 |
| **Survey Files** | Survey files available after award; schedule and cost assumptions must account for this | Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; §10 SOW-024 |

## Construction

### Content Structure (CANONICAL — Authoritative for Narrative Organization)
**Note:** This Content Structure is the definitive narrative organization for DEL-05-03. Procedure.md Step 3 references this structure as authoritative. [**LENSING A-003**]

| Section | Content | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Introduction** | Overview of pricing basis and relationship to Schedules A & B | Context-setting |
| **2. Addenda Integration** | Acknowledgement and impact summary for Addenda 01, 02, 03 | Compliance demonstration |
| **3. Base Scope Assumptions** | What is included in base pricing (design, construction, commissioning) | Scope clarity |
| **4. Exclusions** | What is explicitly excluded (pickled sand building, FF&E from base) | Risk mitigation |
| **5. Allowances** | Allowance items and values (e.g., site servicing tie-ins, survey contingencies) | Transparency |
| **6. Additional Options** | Pricing approach for Options 1–6; monitoring fee treatment | Optional scope handling |
| **7. Value Alternatives** | Value-optimization ideas listed separately (SOW-028) | Competitive differentiation |
| **8. Pricing Assumptions** | Key estimating assumptions (schedule, market conditions, site access, procurement) | Estimating basis |

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on standard pricing narrative organization, designated as CANONICAL per LENSING A-003.

### Key Narrative Elements (TBD — Awaiting Estimator Input)
**Note:** Without these essential facts, binding pricing basis is a scaffold only. These must be populated by Estimator / Commercial Lead before enrichment can conclude. [**LENSING A-001**]

| Element | Status | Responsible Party | Required Input |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Site servicing allowance value** | TBD | Estimator / Commercial Lead | Specific allowance value per Addendum 03 approach |
| **Market pricing date** | TBD | Estimator / Commercial Lead | Quarter/year basis for cost data (e.g., "Q3 2024") |
| **Labor and material availability assumptions** | TBD | Estimator / Commercial Lead | Regional labor market basis, material supply chain status |
| **Site access and logistics assumptions** | TBD | Estimator / Commercial Lead | Access routes, laydown areas, staging constraints |
| **Long-lead procurement items and timelines** | TBD | Estimator / Commercial Lead | Generator, fire apparatus exhaust, overhead doors, access control lead times |
| **Contingency percentage and rationale** | TBD | Estimator / Commercial Lead | Contingency magnitude and risk-based justification |
