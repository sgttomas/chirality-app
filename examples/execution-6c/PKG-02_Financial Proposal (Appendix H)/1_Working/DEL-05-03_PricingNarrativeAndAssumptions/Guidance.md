# Guidance: DEL-05-03 Pricing Narrative and Assumptions

## Purpose

The Pricing Narrative and Assumptions document serves multiple critical functions in a Design-Build RFP response:

### Guidance Scope Demarcation [**LENSING B-005**]
This document contains three types of guidance with distinct applicability:
- **Principles (Section 2)** = Normative direction — MUST apply in all circumstances
- **Considerations (Section 3)** = Contextual factors — MAY apply depending on project conditions
- **Trade-offs (Section 4)** = Competing concerns requiring judgment — BALANCE case-by-case based on strategy

When guidance appears to overlap, apply this hierarchy: Principles take precedence over Considerations; Considerations inform Trade-off resolution.

1. **Transparency and credibility:** By explicitly stating what is included, excluded, and assumed, the proponent demonstrates intellectual honesty and reduces post-award disputes.

2. **Risk allocation clarity:** Allowances and exclusions help define the boundary between proponent risk (what is priced) and owner risk or post-award negotiation (what is deferred or excluded).

3. **Evaluation support:** Evaluators need context to understand whether pricing is complete, competitive, and consistent with the conceptual design and delivery methodology presented elsewhere in the proposal.

4. **Competitive differentiation:** While the numerical price (Schedule A/B) is heavily weighted (35 points per Decomposition §15), the narrative provides an opportunity to demonstrate estimating rigor, market knowledge, and value-conscious thinking—especially through value alternatives (SOW-028).

5. **Post-award foundation:** The assumptions documented here become part of the contract baseline and inform any change management or value engineering discussions during design development and construction.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on Design-Build procurement best practices and RFP evaluation structure (Decomposition §15).

## Principles

### Principle 1: Source Fidelity Over Optimism
**Statement:** Every pricing assumption should be traceable to a source (RFP, addenda, site report, market data, or professional judgment). If an assumption is based on judgment rather than documented fact, label it explicitly as such.

**Rationale:** Overly optimistic assumptions (e.g., perfect site conditions, ideal schedule, rock-bottom subcontractor pricing) may win the bid but create cost overruns and disputes post-award. Credible assumptions build trust and set realistic expectations.

**Application:** When drafting the assumptions section, cite sources for each assumption (e.g., "labor availability assumption based on [market report]" or "site access assumption based on [geotechnical report Section X]"). If no source is available, state "Professional judgment — subject to validation during design."

**Assumption Labeling Standard:** [**LENSING A-005**] Use explicit prefix markers to distinguish facts from judgments:
- **[FACT: source]** — For assumptions based on documented evidence
  - Example: `[FACT: Geotech Report Section 4.2 indicates rock at 3m+ depth]`
  - Example: `[FACT: Addendum 03 confirms 12-acre developable site]`
- **[ASSUMPTION: rationale]** — For assumptions based on professional judgment
  - Example: `[ASSUMPTION: Labor availability per regional construction union data, pending validation]`
  - Example: `[ASSUMPTION: 8-week lead time for overhead doors based on recent project experience]`

This labeling standard ensures defensibility and enables evaluators to distinguish documented facts from professional judgment.

**Conservatism Principle (Consolidated):** [**LENSING B-006**] When in doubt, state conservative assumptions and identify them as risks in the risk register (DEL-09-01). Transparency enables evaluators to assess risk. Aggressive assumptions must be explicitly marked as such and justified by market data or project experience. See also Trade-off 2 for guidance on balancing conservatism with competitiveness.

**Trade-off:** More conservative assumptions may result in higher pricing, reducing competitiveness. However, they also reduce post-award risk and change order potential.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on Design-Build risk management principles.

---

### Principle 2: Addenda Integration is Mandatory, Not Optional
**Statement:** All addenda must be acknowledged and their impacts on pricing must be clearly explained. This is a **compliance requirement** (Decomposition C-07: failure to acknowledge addenda may disqualify the price proposal).

**Rationale:** Addenda often clarify ambiguities, remove or add scope, and adjust requirements. Failing to integrate them results in non-compliant pricing that does not reflect the actual project scope.

**Application:**
- Create an "Addenda Integration" section early in the narrative.
- List each addendum (01, 02, 03) with a brief summary of its impact on pricing.
- For Addendum 03 specifically, highlight:
  - Removal of pickled sand storage building (cost reduction)
  - Allowance approach for site servicing tie-ins (deferred cost clarity)
  - FF&E optional treatment (scope boundary clarification)
  - Technical clarifications (overhead door height, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar readiness) — these affect cost but are now clearly scoped.

**Source:** Decomposition §3 C-07; §4 Addenda Integration Summary.

---

### Principle 3: Allowances are Transparency Tools, Not Escape Hatches
**Statement:** Allowances should be used to acknowledge uncertainty in scope or quantity, with a reasonable placeholder value, **not** as a way to defer all difficult estimating to post-award.

**Rationale:** Excessive use of allowances (or allowances without stated values) can signal incomplete estimating or risk-shifting to the owner. Evaluators may penalize vague allowances or question whether the proponent has adequately scoped the work.

**Application:**
- For site servicing tie-ins (R-3), state the allowance value (e.g., "$50,000 allowance for water, sanitary, and storm tie-ins pending utility coordination") or explain why the value is deferred (e.g., "Allowance value TBD pending Town confirmation of tie-in locations and requirements").
- For any other allowances (e.g., rock excavation if geotechnical data is ambiguous, survey contingencies), provide:
  - **Item description** (what is the uncertainty?)
  - **Placeholder value** (best estimate or range)
  - **Trigger for adjustment** (what post-award information will finalize the cost?)

**Trade-off:** Stating a specific allowance value locks in a number that may be too high (uncompetitive) or too low (post-award cost pressure). However, providing no value or context undermines credibility.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on estimating best practices; Decomposition §4 Addendum 03 (allowance approach permitted).

---

### Principle 4: Exclusions Must Be Explicit and Justifiable
**Statement:** Any scope exclusion must be stated clearly, with a rationale traceable to the RFP or addenda. Unjustified exclusions may be interpreted as incomplete proposals.

**Rationale:** Evaluators assume the proposal price covers all work required to deliver a complete, functional building unless an exclusion is explicitly stated and justified.

**Application:**
- **Pickled sand storage building:** Explicitly state this is excluded per Addendum 03 (to be issued as separate RFP). This is a **justified exclusion** — it's in the addendum.
- **FF&E:** State whether FF&E is included in base price or excluded (and if excluded, whether it is priced as an additional item). Per Addendum 03, it **may** be treated as optional. If excluded from base, justify by referencing Addendum 03 and state where it is addressed (if at all).
- **Survey files:** State that survey files are **not included** in this proposal (they will be provided by the Town after award per Addendum 03). This is a justified exclusion with a clear rationale.

**Caution:** Do **not** exclude items that are clearly required by the RFP without explicit addendum or owner authorization. Examples of unjustifiable exclusions: commissioning, warranty, permits, design discipline coordination.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; **ASSUMPTION** based on proposal compliance principles.

---

### Principle 5: Value Alternatives Must Be Additive, Not Substitutive
**Statement:** Value alternatives or optimization ideas (SOW-028) must be presented as **optional enhancements or cost-saving opportunities**, not as replacements for compliant base scope.

**Rationale:** RFP §8.5 (location TBD) allows alternatives, but the base proposal must stand alone and be fully compliant. Presenting alternatives as "either/or" choices can undermine the base proposal's credibility or create confusion about what is actually being offered.

**Application:**
- Structure the narrative so that the base scope, exclusions, and assumptions are presented **first** and stand on their own.
- Present value alternatives in a **separate section** (e.g., "Value Optimization Opportunities") with clear labels:
  - Alternative ID
  - Description (what is being proposed?)
  - Cost impact (savings or cost-neutral trade-off?)
  - Benefit (why is this valuable?)
  - Owner decision required (what does the Town need to decide to implement this alternative?)

**Examples of value alternatives (ASSUMPTION — require estimator input):**
- Substitution of a material or system for equivalent performance at lower cost
- Phasing strategy that accelerates schedule or reduces interim costs
- Site layout optimization that reduces earthwork or utility runs

**Source:** Decomposition §10 SOW-028; **ASSUMPTION** based on Design-Build value engineering practices.

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Timing of Pricing vs. Level of Design
**Issue:** At proposal stage, design is conceptual. Many quantities, details, and conditions are not yet known. Pricing must balance completeness (to be competitive and credible) with acknowledgment of uncertainty (to avoid post-award disputes).

**Implications:**
- Use allowances for items with high uncertainty (e.g., rock excavation quantities, utility tie-in locations).
- Use ranges or contingency percentages for items with moderate uncertainty (e.g., subcontractor availability, material escalation).
- Use firm values for items with high confidence (e.g., major equipment specified in OSR, labor rates from recent projects).

**Cross-reference:** This consideration ties to **Principle 1** (source fidelity) and **Principle 3** (allowances as transparency tools).

---

### Consideration 2: Market Conditions and Escalation
**Issue:** Pricing is typically based on current or near-term market conditions. If the project schedule extends beyond 6–12 months (see DEL-08-01 schedule), material and labor costs may escalate.

**Implications:**
- State the **pricing date** (e.g., "Pricing based on Q3 2024 market conditions").
- State whether escalation is **included** in the price or **excluded** and assumed to be negotiated post-award.
- If escalation is included, state the assumed escalation rate and time horizon (e.g., "2% annual escalation assumed for materials; 3% for labor over 18-month construction period").

**Caution:** If the RFP requires a fixed-price contract, escalation must be built into the price. If the contract allows for cost adjustments, escalation may be addressed through contract clauses rather than upfront pricing.

**Contract Type Clarification Required:** [**LENSING B-003**] RFP contract type is essential context for framing pricing assumptions:
- **If fixed-price contract:** Escalation must be built into base price; assumptions must account for full project duration risk
- **If GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Price):** Escalation may be shared risk; assumptions may identify escalation as a GMP contingency item
- **If cost-plus:** Escalation handled through adjustment clauses; assumptions document basis only

**Action Required:** Verify RFP contract type before finalizing assumption strategy. Update this Consideration accordingly once contract type is confirmed.

**Source:** **TBD** — RFP contract terms (location TBD); **ASSUMPTION** based on standard Design-Build contracting; **LENSING B-003** (rationale gap identified).

---

### Consideration 3: Site Access and Logistics Constraints
**Issue:** The site is a greenfield parcel with potential constraints from adjacent wetlands, flood fringe areas, and existing grading/subdivision plans. Access routes, laydown areas, and utility staging all affect cost.

**Implications:**
- Reference the **site due diligence summary** (DEL-09-02) for constraints identified in geotechnical, wetland, environmental, and grading reports.
- State assumptions about site access (e.g., "Access via [road name] assumed; no off-site road improvements required").
- State assumptions about laydown and staging (e.g., "Laydown area within 12-acre developable site; no off-site staging required").
- If constraints are identified but not yet fully resolved (e.g., wetland setbacks, seasonal access restrictions), include an allowance or note the assumption for post-award validation.

**Cross-reference:** This consideration ties to **R-10** (12-acre developable site basis) and **DEL-09-02** (site conditions summary).

---

### Consideration 4: Procurement Lead Times
**Issue:** Long-lead items (e.g., generator, fire apparatus exhaust systems, overhead doors, access control systems) may have extended delivery times that affect schedule and cost.

**Implications:**
- Identify long-lead items in the narrative.
- State assumptions about lead times (e.g., "Generator procurement: 16-week lead time assumed").
- Cross-reference to the schedule (DEL-08-01) to confirm lead times are reflected in the Gantt chart.
- If lead times are uncertain or subject to market volatility, note the assumption and identify it as a schedule/cost risk in the risk register (DEL-09-01).

**Source:** **TBD** — requires estimator input on specific long-lead items and vendor quotes/lead time data.

---

### Consideration 5: Consistency with Design Concept
**Issue:** The pricing narrative must be consistent with the design concept (DEL-02-01), design brief (DEL-02-02), and construction methodology (DEL-04-01). Inconsistencies create credibility gaps.

**Implications:**
- If the concept shows a specific building size, structure type, or site layout, the pricing assumptions should reference those choices (e.g., "Structural system: pre-engineered metal building on slab-on-grade foundation, per concept design").
- If the construction methodology identifies phasing or sequencing strategies, the pricing should reflect those (e.g., "Site mobilization and grading prior to building foundation, per construction methodology").
- **Cross-check during Pass 2:** Verify that assumptions in this narrative align with statements in DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, and DEL-04-01.

**Cross-reference:** This is a **boundary condition** from Specification (aligned with design concept) and ties to **R-8** (consistency with schedules).

---

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Detailed Assumptions vs. Proposal Page Budget
**Competing concerns:**
- **More detail** = greater transparency, credibility, and basis for post-award discussions
- **Page constraints** = RFP §4.2–4.3 (location TBD) requires single PDF under 15 MB; excessive detail in assumptions may consume page budget better used for design or team content

**Guidance:**
- Prioritize **high-impact assumptions** (those that most affect cost or risk): site conditions, long-lead procurement, allowances, exclusions.
- Use **tables or bulleted lists** for conciseness.
- Defer **low-impact details** to Schedule B line-item notes (if permitted) or appendices (if allowed).

**Source:** Decomposition §3 C-01 (15 MB limit); **ASSUMPTION** on page budget prioritization.

---

### Trade-off 2: Conservative Assumptions (Lower Risk) vs. Competitive Pricing (Higher Score)
**Competing concerns:**
- **Conservative assumptions** (e.g., higher contingencies, longer schedules, allowances for unknowns) reduce post-award cost risk but increase proposal price → lower evaluation score (price category is 35 points).
- **Aggressive assumptions** (e.g., minimal contingencies, optimistic productivity, no allowances) produce competitive pricing but increase post-award cost risk and change order potential.

**Guidance:**
- Adopt a **risk-balanced approach**: use conservative assumptions for items with high uncertainty or high consequence (e.g., geotechnical conditions, long-lead procurement), but use market-competitive assumptions for well-understood items (e.g., standard construction labor rates, commodity materials).
- **Transparency over optimism:** If an assumption is aggressive, state it explicitly and identify it as a risk in the risk register (DEL-09-01).
- Use **value alternatives** (SOW-028) to demonstrate cost-consciousness without undermining base proposal conservatism.

**Cross-reference:** [**LENSING B-006**] This trade-off relates to Principle 1 (Source Fidelity Over Optimism). The consolidated conservatism principle in Principle 1 provides the authoritative framework; this trade-off addresses the strategic balance when competitive pressure exists.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on Design-Build pricing strategy.

---

### Trade-off 3: Allowances (Flexibility) vs. Fixed Pricing (Certainty)
**Competing concerns:**
- **Allowances** provide flexibility to adjust costs post-award as scope is refined, but excessive allowances can be perceived as incomplete estimating or risk-shifting.
- **Fixed pricing** (no allowances) provides the owner with cost certainty and simplifies evaluation, but increases proponent risk if scope is genuinely uncertain.

**Guidance:**
- Use allowances **only where genuinely justified** by RFP ambiguity or addendum permission (e.g., site servicing tie-ins per Addendum 03).
- For all other items, provide **fixed pricing** based on best available information (concept design, site reports, market data).
- If an allowance is used, **state the trigger for adjustment** (e.g., "Allowance will be finalized upon Town confirmation of utility tie-in locations and sizes").

**Source:** Decomposition §4 Addendum 03 (allowance approach permitted for tie-ins); **ASSUMPTION** on allowance strategy.
