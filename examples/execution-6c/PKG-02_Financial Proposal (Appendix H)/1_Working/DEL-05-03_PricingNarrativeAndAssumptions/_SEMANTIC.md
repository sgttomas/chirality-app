# Deliverable: DEL-05-03 Pricing Narrative and Assumptions

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to transparently communicate the rationale, boundaries, and estimating foundations that underpin a financial proposal's numerical schedules. It must carry knowledge sufficient to justify cost representations, delineate scope inclusions from exclusions and allowances, and render the risk allocation embedded in pricing assumptions visible and defensible to evaluators.
