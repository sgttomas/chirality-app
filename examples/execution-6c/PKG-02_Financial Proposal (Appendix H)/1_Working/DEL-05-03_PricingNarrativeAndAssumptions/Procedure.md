# Procedure: DEL-05-03 Pricing Narrative and Assumptions

## Purpose

This procedure describes the process for **producing** the Pricing Narrative and Assumptions deliverable (DEL-05-03), which supports the Appendix H Schedules A and B for the Penhold Public Services Building RFP response.

The procedure is intended for use by the Estimator / Commercial Lead (deliverable owner) and Proposal Manager (integration and compliance lead).

**Context:** This deliverable is part of PKG-02 (Financial Proposal) and must be coordinated with DEL-05-01 (Schedule A) and DEL-05-02 (Schedule B), as well as cross-referenced to design, schedule, and risk deliverables for consistency.

**Source:** Decomposition §8 DEL-05-03; AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol (dual-use procedure: production of deliverable).

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
**Dependency tracking mode:** NOT_TRACKED — dependencies are coordinated externally by humans (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md` and `execution/_Coordination/_COORDINATION.md`).

The following inputs should be available or in progress before starting this deliverable:

| Input | Status Required | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Decomposition document** | Final (addenda-integrated) | Provides scope, objectives, deliverable definitions, and SOW traceability |
| **Appendix H Schedules A & B** (DEL-05-01, DEL-05-02) | Draft or in progress | Narrative must be consistent with numerical pricing; cross-check required. **Dependency Handling:** [**LENSING A-004**] If Schedules A/B are NOT available at Step 3 start, draft narrative with TBD placeholders for specific values and defer Step 4 cross-reference until schedules are finalized. Step 2 prerequisite check should confirm Schedule A/B status before proceeding. |
| **Concept design** (DEL-02-01) | Draft or in progress | Pricing assumptions must align with design scope and approach |
| **Construction methodology** (DEL-04-01) | Draft or in progress | Pricing assumptions must align with construction approach and sequencing |
| **Detailed schedule** (DEL-08-01) | Draft or in progress | Schedule assumptions (durations, procurement lead times) must align with pricing assumptions |
| **Site due diligence summary** (DEL-09-02) | Draft or in progress | Site condition assumptions must reference geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading reports |
| **Risk register** (DEL-09-01) | Draft or in progress | Risks identified in pricing (e.g., aggressive assumptions, allowances, long-lead items) should be cross-referenced to risk register |

**Source:** Specification boundary conditions; **ASSUMPTION** on typical proposal production workflow.

### Operational Pricing Capacity Prerequisites [**LENSING C-002**]
Before beginning cost assembly execution, verify the Estimator has access to sufficient operational pricing capacity:

| Prerequisite | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost database** (RS Means or equivalent) | TBD | Required for unit cost benchmarking |
| **Recent competitive quotes** (major building systems) | TBD | HVAC, structural, electrical — vendor quotes from similar projects |
| **Subcontractor pricing network** | TBD | Local Alberta market contacts for trade pricing |
| **Labor rate source** | TBD | Union or non-union rates, regional average for Central Alberta |

**Constraint Handling:** If any prerequisite is not available:
1. Note constraint in assumptions section
2. Use database/parametric estimates with explicit confidence level notation (see Specification R-7 adjudicative standard)
3. Flag for validation during design development phase

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Review Context and Establish Scope
**Action:**
1. Read `_CONTEXT.md` to confirm deliverable identity, acceptance criteria, and scope traceability.
2. Read the deliverable entry in the decomposition document (DEL-05-03) to understand:
   - Anticipated artifacts
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Related scope items (SOW-028)
   - Related objectives (OBJ-007)
3. Read `_REFERENCES.md` to identify available reference materials.
4. Confirm access to Addenda 01, 02, 03 and site due diligence reports in _Sources/.

**Verification:** Deliverable scope and acceptance criteria are clear; reference materials are accessible.

**Prerequisite Verification Enhancement:** [**LENSING X-002**] Beyond confirming documents are "accessible," verify actual use:
- Estimator confirms: Addenda 01-03 read and impacts noted in working summary
- Estimator confirms: Geotechnical and site reports reviewed for assumptions relevant to pricing
- **Evidence:** Dated notes or checkmarks in access log demonstrating review, not just availability

**Output:** Internal understanding of deliverable requirements and available inputs.

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead

---

### Step 2: Review Schedules A and B (Cross-Check Preparation)
**Action:**
1. Obtain draft or in-progress versions of:
   - DEL-05-01 (Appendix H Schedule A — Pricing Summary)
   - DEL-05-02 (Appendix H Schedule B — Cost Breakdown)
2. Review Schedule A to identify:
   - Base scope total
   - Additional Options 1–6 pricing
   - Tax treatment
   - Addenda acknowledgement line (compliance check)
3. Review Schedule B to identify:
   - Cost breakdown structure (general requirements, building, sitework, additional options)
   - Allowance line items (if any)
   - Monitoring fee separation (for Option 4, if applicable)
4. Create a **cross-reference log** to track items that must be consistent between the narrative and the schedules:
   - Allowance descriptions and values
   - Exclusion statements
   - Additional Options descriptions
   - Technical scope items (overhead doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar readiness)

**Verification:** Cross-reference log is established; draft Schedules A and B are available for consistency checking.

**Output:** Cross-reference log (informal tracking tool).

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead

**Note:** If Schedules A and B are not yet available, defer this step and proceed with narrative drafting based on known scope; cross-check will occur in Step 5.

---

### Step 3: Draft Narrative Sections
**Action:** Draft the narrative using the **CANONICAL Content Structure from Datasheet.md** (Construction > Content Structure section, Sections 1–8) as the definitive narrative organization. [**LENSING A-003**] This ensures consistent structure between Datasheet architecture and Procedure implementation.

Populate the following sections per the Datasheet Content Structure and Specification requirements:

#### 3.1 Introduction
- State the purpose of this narrative (to explain pricing basis and assumptions for Schedules A and B).
- Reference the evaluation criteria (35 points for Proposal Price per Decomposition §15).
- Establish the document's role in supporting transparency and credibility.

**Source:** Guidance Purpose; **ASSUMPTION** on introduction content.

---

#### 3.2 Addenda Integration (Requirement R-1)
- Explicitly acknowledge Addenda 01, 02, and 03.
- Summarize the pricing impact of each addendum:
  - **Addendum 01:** Program clarifications (no direct pricing impact; design innovation flexibility)
  - **Addendum 02:** Formatting clarification (no pricing impact)
  - **Addendum 03:** Multiple impacts:
    - 12-acre developable site (sitework scope basis)
    - Pickled sand storage building removed (cost reduction / exclusion)
    - Site servicing tie-in allowance approach permitted
    - FF&E optional treatment (not in base cost)
    - Technical requirements clarified (doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar readiness)
- Use Example 1 from Guidance.md as a scaffold.

**Source:** Specification R-1; Guidance Example 1; Decomposition §4.

---

#### 3.3 Base Scope Assumptions
- Describe what is **included** in the base proposal price (design, construction, commissioning, warranty).
- Reference the concept design (DEL-02-01) and construction methodology (DEL-04-01) to establish scope boundaries.
- Highlight technical requirements from Addendum 03 that are included:
  - Overhead doors (16 ft height)
  - Bay sumps
  - Fire apparatus exhaust systems
  - Generator (sized to support Incident Command Post)
  - Fill stations
  - Solar-capable roof and orientation (preparatory work; PV array may be offered as value alternative)

**Source:** Specification R-9; Guidance Principle 1 (source fidelity).

---

#### 3.4 Exclusions (Requirements R-2, R-4)
- State explicit exclusions with rationale:
  - **Pickled sand storage building** (removed per Addendum 03)
  - **FF&E** (priced as additional item per Addendum 03, not in base cost)
  - **Survey files** (provided by Town post-award per Addendum 03)
  - **Utility connection fees** (if applicable — **TBD**: confirm RFP requirement)
- Use Example 3 from Guidance.md as a scaffold.

**Source:** Specification R-2, R-4; Guidance Example 3; Guidance Principle 4 (exclusions must be explicit and justifiable).

---

#### 3.5 Allowances (Requirement R-3)
- Provide a table of allowance items with:
  - Item description
  - Allowance value (if determined; otherwise state "TBD pending estimator input")
  - Rationale (why is this an allowance?)
  - Adjustment trigger (what post-award information will finalize the cost?)
- Key allowance: **Site servicing tie-ins** (permitted per Addendum 03).
- Other potential allowances (if applicable): rock excavation, survey contingency, hazmat abatement (if environmental report identifies potential).
- Use Example 2 from Guidance.md as a scaffold.

**Source:** Specification R-3; Guidance Example 2; Guidance Principle 3 (allowances are transparency tools).

**Detail:** Specific allowance values are **TBD** — require estimator input and cross-check with Schedule B.

---

#### 3.6 Additional Options (1–6) Pricing Basis (Requirement R-5)
- Explain the scope and pricing basis for each of the six Additional Options:
  1. Built-in wash bay
  2. Yard lighting
  3. Building access control
  4. Security/cameras (+ monitoring fee separated)
  5. Exterior signage (branding)
  6. Appliances
- Confirm that monitoring fee for Option 4 is separated in Schedule B (per requirement).
- Cross-reference to Schedule A for pricing values.

**Source:** Specification R-5; Decomposition §5 vocab (Additional Options).

**Detail:** Specific scope descriptions for each option are **TBD** — require estimator and design team input.

---

#### 3.7 Value Alternatives (Requirement R-6, SOW-028)
- If value alternatives or optimization ideas are being offered, present them in a table:
  - Alternative ID
  - Description
  - Cost impact
  - Benefit
  - Owner decision required
- State clearly that alternatives are **optional** and the base proposal is fully compliant without them.
- Use Example 4 from Guidance.md as a scaffold.

**Source:** Specification R-6; Guidance Example 4; Guidance Principle 5 (value alternatives must be additive).

**Detail:** Specific value alternatives are **TBD** — require estimator and design team input; may be omitted if no alternatives are being offered.

---

#### 3.8 Pricing Assumptions (Requirement R-7)
- Document key estimating assumptions in a table or structured list:
  - **Market pricing date** (e.g., "Q3 2024")
  - **Escalation** (included or excluded; if included, state rate and time horizon)
  - **Labor availability** (assumptions about crew availability, productivity)
  - **Material availability** (assumptions about supply chain, lead times)
  - **Site access and logistics** (access routes, laydown areas, staging assumptions)
  - **Procurement lead times** (long-lead items: generator, fire apparatus exhaust, overhead doors, access control, etc.)
  - **Contingency** (magnitude and rationale)
  - **Survey timing** (files provided by Town post-award per Addendum 03; any supplementary survey needs assumed)
- Cross-reference assumptions to:
  - Schedule (DEL-08-01) for procurement lead times and durations
  - Site due diligence summary (DEL-09-02) for site access and geotechnical/environmental assumptions
  - Risk register (DEL-09-01) for risks associated with aggressive or uncertain assumptions

**Source:** Specification R-7; Guidance Considerations 2, 3, 4.

**Detail:** Specific assumption values are **TBD** — require estimator input.

---

**Verification (Step 3):** All required sections are drafted; TBD items are flagged for estimator input.

**Output:** Draft narrative document with all sections populated (some sections may contain TBD placeholders).

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead

---

### Step 4: Cross-Reference to Schedules A and B (Requirement R-8)
**Action:**
1. Using the cross-reference log from Step 2, compare the narrative to Schedules A and B:
   - **Allowances:** Confirm allowance descriptions and values match between narrative and Schedule B.
   - **Exclusions:** Confirm excluded items (pickled sand building, FF&E if excluded) do **not** appear as line items in Schedule A or B.
   - **Additional Options:** Confirm descriptions and scope in narrative match Schedule A option pricing lines.
   - **Monitoring fee:** Confirm monitoring fee for Option 4 is separated in Schedule B as stated in narrative.
   - **Technical requirements:** Confirm technical items listed in narrative (doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar readiness) are reflected in Schedule B breakdown (or at least implicitly included in building cost).
2. Flag any discrepancies for resolution:
   - If narrative states an allowance but Schedule B does not include it → add to Schedule B or revise narrative.
   - If narrative excludes an item but Schedule A/B prices it → resolve exclusion statement or add to base scope.
   - If option descriptions differ → align narrative and Schedule A.
3. **Bidirectional Cross-Check:** [**LENSING X-003**] Perform both directions of consistency verification:
   - **Forward check (narrative → schedules):** Narrative items all appear in Schedule B (current procedure)
   - **Reverse check (schedules → narrative):** Schedule B line items all addressed in narrative or explicitly excluded with rationale
   - Flag any orphaned schedule items that lack narrative justification
4. Update the narrative to resolve discrepancies (or update Schedules A/B if narrative is authoritative).

**Variance Adjudication Authority:** [**LENSING D-002**]
- **Estimator** proposes resolution for narrative-vs-schedules discrepancies
- **Proposal Manager** adjudicates (has final authority over narrative-vs-schedules conflicts)
- If resolution requires design change (e.g., allowance scope affects concept), escalate to PKG-04 lead for input
- Document decision in cross-reference log with rationale

**Verification:** Cross-reference log shows no unresolved discrepancies; narrative and Schedules A/B are consistent.

**Output:** Cross-reference log (updated); narrative revisions (if needed).

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead + Proposal Manager (joint review)

---

### Step 5: Cross-Reference to Related Deliverables (Consistency Check)

**Dependency Handling for Related Deliverables:** [**LENSING X-001**]
- Step 5 can proceed with **draft/preliminary versions** of related deliverables
- If related deliverables are unavailable, document assumption in narrative (e.g., "pricing assumes X per preliminary concept") and flag for validation in enrichment Phase 2
- **Deferral trigger:** If related deliverable not available by end of Step 3, defer Step 5 to enrichment pass
- Do not block narrative production; document gaps as TBD and proceed

**Action:**
1. Cross-check pricing assumptions in the narrative against related deliverables:
   - **Concept design (DEL-02-01):** Confirm pricing is based on the building size, structure type, and site layout shown in the concept.
   - **Design brief (DEL-02-02):** Confirm materials and systems described in the design brief are consistent with pricing basis.
   - **Construction methodology (DEL-04-01):** Confirm construction approach (phasing, sequencing, logistics) described in methodology aligns with pricing assumptions (e.g., site access, staging, schedule).
   - **Schedule (DEL-08-01):** Confirm procurement lead times and construction durations in the narrative align with the schedule Gantt chart.
   - **Site due diligence summary (DEL-09-02):** Confirm site condition assumptions (geotechnical, wetlands, environmental, grading) in the narrative reference the same reports and conclusions.
   - **Risk register (DEL-09-01):** Confirm any aggressive assumptions or allowances flagged in the narrative are also identified as risks in the risk register.
2. Flag any inconsistencies for resolution:
   - If narrative assumes a different building size or structure type than the concept → align with concept or update concept.
   - If narrative assumes a different schedule than DEL-08-01 → align with schedule or update schedule.
   - If narrative references a site condition that contradicts DEL-09-02 → align with due diligence summary.
3. Populate the **Conflict Table** in Guidance.md if inconsistencies cannot be resolved from available information (require human ruling).

**Verification:** Cross-deliverable consistency is confirmed; Conflict Table is populated if unresolved issues exist.

**Output:** Narrative revisions (if needed); Conflict Table entries (if applicable).

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead + Proposal Manager (joint review)

---

### Step 6: Review Against Specification Requirements
**Action:**
1. Review the narrative against each requirement in Specification.md (R-1 through R-10):
   - R-1: Addenda acknowledgement present and impacts summarized?
   - R-2: Pickled sand building exclusion stated?
   - R-3: Site servicing tie-in allowance explained?
   - R-4: FF&E treatment clarified?
   - R-5: Additional Options 1–6 described and consistent with Schedule A?
   - R-6: Value alternatives (if any) presented as optional and compliant?
   - R-7: Pricing assumptions documented and cross-referenced?
   - R-8: Consistency with Schedules A and B confirmed?
   - R-9: Technical requirements from Addendum 03 acknowledged?
   - R-10: 12-acre developable site basis stated?
2. Mark each requirement as **PASS** or **TBD** (if estimator input is needed).
3. Create a checklist or table for requirement verification status.

**Verification:** All requirements are addressed (PASS) or flagged as TBD with a path to completion.

**Output:** Requirement verification checklist.

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead

---

### Step 7: Final Review and Approval
**Action:**
1. Conduct a final review of the narrative for:
   - **Clarity:** Is the narrative clear and concise?
   - **Completeness:** Are all required sections present?
   - **Consistency:** Are all cross-references valid (to Schedules A/B and other deliverables)?
   - **Compliance:** Does the narrative support RFP compliance (addenda acknowledgement, scope clarity, no unjustified exclusions)?
   - **Credibility:** Are assumptions transparent, sourced, and defensible?
2. Obtain sign-off from:
   - Estimator / Commercial Lead (deliverable owner)
   - Proposal Manager (compliance and integration lead)
   - **TBD:** Final approval authority (senior leadership?)
3. Integrate the narrative into the proposal PDF structure (coordinated by Proposal Manager as part of PKG-01 DEL-01-02 Final Submission Package).

**Verification:** Narrative is approved and ready for integration into proposal PDF.

**Output:** Final narrative document; approval record.

**Responsibility:** Estimator / Commercial Lead + Proposal Manager + approval authority (TBD)

---

### Step 8: Update Status
**Action:**
1. Read `_STATUS.md` to confirm current state.
2. If current state is **OPEN**, update to **INITIALIZED** and append history entry:
   - `[2026-02-04] — State set to INITIALIZED (4_DOCUMENTS agent — enrichment pass completed)`
3. If current state is **not** OPEN, do **not** modify `_STATUS.md` (no state regression). Report status update was skipped due to current state.

**Verification:** `_STATUS.md` is updated to INITIALIZED (if applicable).

**Output:** Updated `_STATUS.md`.

**Responsibility:** Agent (automated) or Estimator / Commercial Lead (manual)

## Records

### Documentation Produced
1. **Pricing Narrative and Assumptions document** (this deliverable) — final version integrated into proposal PDF
2. **Cross-reference log** (informal) — tracking consistency between narrative and Schedules A/B (retained for internal QA; not submitted)
3. **Requirement verification checklist** (informal) — tracking completion of Specification requirements (retained for internal QA; not submitted)
4. **Approval record** — sign-off from Estimator, Proposal Manager, and final approval authority (retained per proposal management process)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on standard proposal production documentation practices.

---

### Documentation Responsibility
- **Estimator / Commercial Lead:** Produces narrative, cross-reference log, and requirement verification checklist.
- **Proposal Manager:** Integrates narrative into proposal PDF; maintains compliance and approval records.
- **TBD:** Final approval authority and record retention responsibility.

---

**Note:** This procedure describes the production workflow. The resulting Pricing Narrative and Assumptions document is the deliverable artifact. Steps marked **TBD** require estimator input or coordination with other deliverable owners (Schedules A/B, concept design, schedule, etc.).
