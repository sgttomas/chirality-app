# Specification: DEL-05-02 AppendixH ScheduleB CostBreakdown

## Scope

### In Scope

This deliverable produces the completed Schedule B detailed cost breakdown for Appendix H of the Penhold Public Services Building RFP proposal, including:

- **Base Scope Costs:**
  - General Requirements (project management, supervision, temporary facilities, mobilization)
  - Building construction costs (all trades and systems)
  - Sitework costs (grading, utilities, paving, landscaping)

- **Additional Options (1-6) Costs:**
  - Option 1: Built-in wash bay
  - Option 2: Yard lighting
  - Option 3: Building access control
  - Option 4: Security/cameras (with monitoring fee separated)
  - Option 5: Exterior signage (branding)
  - Option 6: Appliances

**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 description); Section 5 (Vocabulary Map); _CONTEXT.md

### Out of Scope

- **Pickled sand storage building:** Removed from RFP scope per Addendum 03 (Source: Decomposition Section 4)
- **FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment):** May be included as separate additional item, NOT in base cost (Source: Decomposition Section 4, Addendum 03; Section 12, OI-004)
- **Schedule A pricing summary:** Covered by DEL-05-01 (Source: Decomposition Section 8)
- **Pricing narrative and assumptions:** Covered by DEL-05-03 (Source: Decomposition Section 8)

### Interface Requirements

- **Schedule A reconciliation:** Schedule B detailed breakdown must sum to Schedule A totals for base and each Additional Option (Source: Decomposition Section 8, DEL-05-02 acceptance criteria)
- **Pricing narrative alignment:** Cost assumptions and exclusions must be consistent with DEL-05-03 (ASSUMPTION: cross-deliverable consistency requirement)

## Requirements

### R-001: Template Compliance
**Statement:** Schedule B SHALL use the Appendix H Schedule B template format provided in the RFP.
**Rationale:** Mandatory template per RFP Section 4.3 and decomposition Section 3 (C-05).
**Source:** Decomposition Section 3 (C-05: "Use Appendix H (Schedule A + Schedule B)")
**Template Location:** **[Lensing A-001]** Appendix H Schedule B template location: RFP Section 4.3; obtain from _Sources/ directory or Proposal Manager. Template format (Excel vs. PDF) must be confirmed before Procedure Step 1 execution.
**Verification:** Template structure match inspection; verify template obtained from authoritative RFP source

### R-002: Cost Category Completeness
**Statement:** Schedule B SHALL include all required cost categories: General Requirements, Building, and Sitework.
**Rationale:** Required breakdown per decomposition deliverable description.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 description); _CONTEXT.md
**Verification:** Category presence check

### R-003: Additional Options Line Items
**Statement:** Schedule B SHALL include separate line items for each of the six Additional Options.
**Rationale:** RFP requires pricing for Additional Options 1-6; evaluators need separate costs.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 description); Section 5 (Vocabulary Map)
**Verification:** Six additional option line items present

### R-004: Monitoring Fee Separation
**Statement:** For Additional Option 4 (Security/cameras), the monitoring fee SHALL be presented as a separate line item.
**Rationale:** Explicit requirement per decomposition acceptance criteria and scope definition.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 acceptance criteria: "monitoring fee separated where required"); Section 5 (Vocabulary Map: Additional Options definition)
**Verification:** Monitoring fee line item present and separated from Option 4 capital cost

### R-005: Schedule A/B Reconciliation
**Statement:** Schedule B detailed costs SHALL sum to match Schedule A totals for base scope and each Additional Option.
**Rationale:** Financial integrity; evaluators will cross-check; acceptance criteria.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 acceptance criteria: "totals match Schedule A"); DEL-05-01 acceptance criteria
**Verification:** Mathematical reconciliation check

### R-006: Addenda Acknowledgement
**Statement:** Appendix H (which includes Schedule B) SHALL include completed addenda acknowledgement line.
**Rationale:** Failure to acknowledge addenda may disqualify the price proposal.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 3 (C-07)
**Location Clarification:** **[Lensing B-004]** Addenda acknowledgement location is TBD pending RFP Appendix H review:
- **If on Schedule B (this deliverable):** DEL-05-02 is responsible for completion
- **If on Schedule A (DEL-05-01):** DEL-05-01 is responsible; coordinate to confirm completion
- **If on Appendix H cover page:** Coordinate with Proposal Manager for completion
**Action Required:** Review RFP Appendix H instructions to determine authoritative location; update deliverable responsibility accordingly.
**Verification:** Addenda acknowledgement line completed at correct location; cross-deliverable coordination confirmed

### R-007: Scope Exclusion (Pickled Sand Storage)
**Statement:** Schedule B base scope costs SHALL NOT include the pickled sand storage building.
**Rationale:** Building removed from RFP scope per Addendum 03.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 4 (Addendum 03 impacts); Section 12 (OI-002 resolved: "pickled sand storage building excluded from proposal scope")
**Verification:** **[Lensing F-001]** Negative check — no pickled sand storage building line item in base costs. **Critical per Addendum 03 and disqualification risk per Decomposition Section 3 (C-07).** Verification must be documented in QA checklist with explicit confirmation of absence.

### R-008: Site Scope Constraint (12-Acre Developable Area)
**Statement:** Sitework costs SHALL reflect development of the 12-acre functional site only (not the full 20-acre parcel).
**Rationale:** 8 acres allocated to dog park/storm pond in flood fringe; clarified per Addendum 03.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 4 (Addendum 03 impacts: "Developable area clarified: 12-acre functional site")
**Verification:** Sitework scope description and quantity basis consistent with 12-acre developable area

### R-009: Completeness
**Statement:** Schedule B SHALL be complete with no missing required line items or categories.
**Rationale:** Acceptance criteria; incomplete pricing may be deemed non-responsive.
**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 acceptance criteria: "Completeness")
**Verification:** **[Lensing C-002]** All anticipated line items present; no TBD placeholders in final submission.
**Anticipated Line Item Checklist (template-dependent):**
- General Requirements: Items 1.1–1.4 (per Guidance.md Example structure, pending template confirmation)
- Building: Items 2.1–2.8 (per Guidance.md Example structure, pending template confirmation)
- Sitework: Items 3.1–3.5 (per Guidance.md Example structure, pending template confirmation)
- Additional Options: Options 1–6 with Option 4 monitoring fee separated
**Action Required:** Obtain Appendix H template and update this checklist with actual required line items before verification.

### R-010: Cost Breakdown Granularity
**Statement:** Schedule B cost breakdown granularity SHALL be sufficient to demonstrate transparency and support evaluation.
**Rationale:** ASSUMPTION: Evaluators need to understand cost composition for 35-point Proposal Price evaluation.
**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on decomposition Section 15 (35 points allocated to Proposal Price) and standard RFP evaluation practices
**Threshold:** **[Lensing A-002, C-001]** Sufficient line-item detail to assess cost allocation across General Requirements, Building, Sitework (per Decomposition Section 15 evaluation criteria). Minimum acceptable granularity:
- **If template prescribes structure:** Follow template exactly
- **If template permits flexibility:** Use 3-level hierarchy (Category > Subcategory > Line Item) per Guidance.md Example
**Verification:** Review against Appendix H template requirements; confirm granularity enables evaluators to assess cost reasonableness for 35-point Proposal Price scoring
