# Guidance: DEL-05-02 AppendixH ScheduleB CostBreakdown

## Purpose

Schedule B provides the detailed cost breakdown that supports the Schedule A pricing summary for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal. Its purpose is to:

1. **Demonstrate cost transparency:** Enable evaluators to understand the composition and reasonableness of the proposed price
2. **Support evaluation scoring:** Facilitate the 35-point Proposal Price evaluation by showing cost allocation across General Requirements, Building, and Sitework
3. **Establish baseline for contract administration:** Provide granular cost data that will inform change management and budget control during project delivery
4. **Enable comparative evaluation:** Allow the Town to compare competing proposals on an apples-to-apples basis

**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 description and acceptance criteria); Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria: 35 points for Proposal Price); ASSUMPTION: Standard RFP evaluation purpose

## Principles

### Principle 1: Transparency Over Opacity

**Statement:** Detailed cost breakdowns build evaluator confidence more effectively than lump-sum pricing.

**Rationale:**
- Design-Build proposals carry inherent scope uncertainty at the proposal stage
- Transparency signals that the proponent has done rigorous estimating and is not hiding risk in contingencies
- For a municipal client, demonstrating accountability for public funds is critical

**Evaluation Scoring Connection:** **[Lensing A-005]** This principle directly supports evaluation scoring by enabling evaluators to assess cost reasonableness across the 35-point Proposal Price category (Decomposition Section 15). Transparent cost breakdowns demonstrate value-for-money to municipal decision-makers and reduce evaluator uncertainty about price credibility.

**Application:**
- Provide sufficient line-item detail to show that major cost categories (structure, envelope, MEP systems, sitework) have been considered
- Avoid overly aggregated costs that obscure where value is allocated
- **Balance:** Too much detail can overwhelm; too little detail can appear evasive — aim for "right-sized" granularity per Appendix H template structure

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (estimating best practice and municipal procurement norms); Decomposition Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria)

### Principle 2: Consistency Across Schedules A and B

**Statement:** Schedule B is a supporting document that must reconcile mathematically to Schedule A.

**Rationale:**
- Schedule A is the summary pricing that evaluators score
- Schedule B is the backup that proves Schedule A is credible
- Any discrepancy will undermine proposal credibility and may trigger evaluator questions or point deductions

**Application:**
- Use linked spreadsheet formulas to ensure Schedule B totals flow correctly to Schedule A
- Perform independent QA cross-check before submission
- Document reconciliation in internal QA worksheet

**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 acceptance criteria: "totals match Schedule A")

### Principle 3: Addenda Compliance is Non-Negotiable

**Statement:** Scope changes introduced by addenda must be fully integrated into cost breakdown.

**Rationale:**
- Addendum 03 removed the pickled sand storage building and clarified the 12-acre developable site
- Failure to reflect addenda changes may result in:
  - Disqualification (per decomposition Section 3, C-07: addenda acknowledgement requirement)
  - Pricing errors that create contract disputes post-award
  - Loss of evaluator confidence

**Application:**
- Exclude pickled sand storage building from all base scope cost categories
- Ensure sitework costs reflect 12-acre developable area (not full 20-acre parcel)
- Complete addenda acknowledgement line (typically on Schedule A or Appendix H cover)
- Cross-reference DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative) to document addenda impacts and assumptions

**Source:** Decomposition Section 3 (C-07); Section 4 (Addendum 03 impacts); Section 12 (OI-002, OI-003 resolved)

### Principle 4: Separation of Capital vs. Operating Costs

**Statement:** Capital costs (one-time construction) and operating costs (recurring monitoring/service fees) must be distinguished clearly.

**Rationale:**
- Additional Option 4 (Security/cameras) includes both capital cost (equipment installation) and operating cost (monitoring fee)
- Municipal budgets treat capital and operating expenses differently (capital projects vs. annual operating budgets)
- Evaluators need to understand long-term financial commitment, not just upfront cost

**Application:**
- Present monitoring fee as a separate line item under Option 4
- Clarify whether monitoring fee is annual, monthly, or term-based (coordinate with DEL-05-03 pricing narrative)
- **Operating cost assessment (per Datasheet.md B-005):**
  - Option 1 (Wash bay): None anticipated
  - Option 2 (Yard lighting): Energy cost — excluded from proposal pricing (operating budget item)
  - Option 3 (Access control): Potential maintenance/software subscription — TBD if required
  - Option 4 (Security/cameras): **Monitoring fee — MUST be separated**
  - Option 5 (Signage): Maintenance — excluded from proposal pricing (operating budget item)
  - Option 6 (Appliances): None anticipated

**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02 acceptance criteria: "monitoring fee separated where required"); Section 5 (Vocabulary Map: Additional Options); Datasheet.md (B-005)

### Principle 5: Right-Sizing Contingency and Allowances

**Statement:** Contingency and allowances should be explicit and defensible, not hidden within line items.

**Rationale:**
- Proposal-stage cost estimates inherently carry uncertainty (concept design maturity is low)
- Evaluators expect proponents to acknowledge and price risk transparently
- Hidden contingencies inflate individual line items and obscure true cost drivers

**Warranted Value Substantiation:** **[Lensing F-003]** For a municipal client, warranted value substantiation is demonstrated when the contingency approach balances transparency with competitive positioning. Evaluators assess whether risk has been thoughtfully priced without inflating total cost unnecessarily. **Recommendation:** Use explicit contingency line (if template permits) or provide clear allocation logic in DEL-05-03 pricing narrative to demonstrate value substantiation.

**Application:**
- **ASSUMPTION:** If Appendix H template includes contingency/allowance lines, populate them explicitly with rationale
- If template does not include contingency lines, consider whether to include allowances within line items or describe them in DEL-05-03 pricing narrative
- Coordinate with DEL-05-03 to document basis of estimate, exclusions, and assumptions
- Example allowances that may be relevant:
  - Service tie-in allowance (per Addendum 03 and decomposition Section 12, OI-003: allowance approach permitted)
  - Geotechnical mitigation allowance (based on reference reports)
  - Design development contingency

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (estimating best practice); Decomposition Section 12 (OI-003: service tie-ins allowance approach); Decomposition Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria)

## Considerations

### Estimating at Proposal Stage

**Challenge:** Detailed design does not exist yet; quantities and specifications are preliminary.

**Cost Source Decision Required:** **[Lensing F-002]** Demonstrated functional adequacy requires knowing the chosen cost source. Options:
1. **Firm internal database:** Historical cost data from comparable projects
2. **External cost guides (e.g., RSMeans):** Published unit costs adjusted for location and time
3. **Hybrid approach:** Internal data supplemented by external benchmarks
**Action Required:** Confirm cost estimation approach with Commercial Lead before Procedure Step 3 execution. Document chosen approach in DEL-05-03 pricing narrative.

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Use reference project data for similar municipal facilities (fire hall + public works combination)
- Apply area-based unit costs ($/SF) for building systems
- Use linear unit costs ($/LF) for utilities and sitework
- Apply percentage-based markups for General Requirements and indirect costs
- Document all assumptions in DEL-05-03 pricing narrative

**Risk:** If estimate is too low, project becomes unprofitable; if too high, proposal is non-competitive.

### Cost Allocation Across General Requirements, Building, Sitework

**General Requirements (typical allocation: 8-12% of construction cost):**
- Project management, superintendence
- Mobilization/demobilization
- Temporary facilities (office, utilities, fencing, signage)
- Project closeout, commissioning support

**Building (typically 60-70% of total cost for Fire Hall + Public Works facility):**
- Foundation and structure
- Building envelope (walls, roofing, windows/doors)
- Interior finishes (flooring, ceilings, paint, specialties)
- Mechanical systems (HVAC, plumbing)
- Electrical systems (power, lighting)
- Fire protection (sprinklers, alarms, apparatus exhaust for fire hall bays)
- Specialties (lockers, apparatus bay doors, fill stations, etc.)

**Sitework (typically 15-25% of total cost, depending on site conditions):**
- Earthwork and grading (note: 12-acre developable area)
- Site utilities (water, sanitary, storm, gas, electrical)
- Paving (apparatus aprons, parking, yard areas)
- Landscaping, topsoil, seeding
- Site lighting (base scope; Option 2 is incremental yard lighting)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (typical cost allocation for municipal facility projects); informed by decomposition Section 8 (DEL-05-02: "general requirements, building, sitework")

### Coordination with Other DEL-05 Deliverables

| Deliverable | Coordination Need | Guidance |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **DEL-05-01 (Schedule A)** | Schedule B must sum to Schedule A totals | Use linked formulas; perform reconciliation check before submission |
| **DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative)** | Assumptions, exclusions, and allowances must be consistent | Cross-reference assumptions documented in narrative; ensure no contradictions |

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (cross-deliverable consistency requirement within PKG-02)

### Addenda Integration Checklist

Before finalizing Schedule B, verify:

- [ ] Pickled sand storage building is **excluded** from all base cost line items
- [ ] Sitework scope reflects **12-acre developable site** (not full 20 acres)
- [ ] Service tie-in costs are treated per allowance approach (Addendum 03 clarification)
- [ ] FF&E is **excluded from base cost** (may be optional additional item per OI-004)
- [ ] Addenda acknowledgement line is **completed** (on Schedule A or Appendix H cover page)
- [ ] All Addendum 03 technical requirements are costed (e.g., overhead door height, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready provisions)

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Granularity vs. Simplicity

**Tension:** More line-item detail increases transparency but also increases estimating effort and risk of arithmetic errors.

**Options:**
- **High granularity:** Break building costs into CSI divisions (e.g., separate lines for concrete, masonry, metals, wood/plastics, thermal/moisture, openings, finishes, specialties, equipment, furnishings, mechanical, electrical, fire protection)
  - **Pro:** Demonstrates rigorous estimating; supports change management granularity
  - **Con:** More labor-intensive; more opportunities for error; may exceed Appendix H template capacity
- **Moderate granularity:** Group costs into major systems (e.g., substructure, superstructure, envelope, interior, MEP, fire protection)
  - **Pro:** Balances transparency with manageability; aligns with typical RFP pricing templates
  - **Con:** Less detail for evaluators to assess cost reasonableness
- **Low granularity:** Lump-sum building cost with minimal breakdown
  - **Pro:** Simplest approach
  - **Con:** Appears evasive; undermines evaluator confidence

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** Follow Appendix H template structure (moderate granularity expected for municipal RFP).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (estimating practice trade-off)

### Trade-off 2: Contingency Visibility vs. Competitive Pricing

**Tension:** Transparent contingency shows risk awareness but may inflate total price relative to competitors who hide contingency or carry less.

**Options:**
- **Explicit contingency line:** Show design contingency and construction contingency as separate line items
  - **Pro:** Transparency; aligns with municipal procurement expectations
  - **Con:** May appear more expensive than competitors who embed contingency within line items
- **Embedded contingency:** Apply contingency percentages within each cost category without labeling
  - **Pro:** Total price appears lower
  - **Con:** Reduces transparency; harder to adjust scope/price during contract negotiation
- **Hybrid:** Show minimal explicit contingency + embed some risk allowances in line items
  - **Pro:** Balances transparency with competitiveness
  - **Con:** Requires careful calibration; risk of under-pricing

**Decision Required:** **[Lensing A-004]** Functional execution of Procedure Step 3 requires a decided markup/overhead/contingency strategy. The above options must be resolved before cost application. **Action Required:** Confirm with Commercial Lead which approach to use and document chosen approach in DEL-05-03 pricing narrative before executing Procedure Step 3.

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** Coordinate with Commercial Lead and review competitor intelligence (if available) to calibrate approach.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (competitive pricing strategy trade-off); _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (A-004)

### Trade-off 3: Allowances vs. Defined Scope

**Tension:** Allowances acknowledge uncertainty but may signal incomplete due diligence.

**Options:**
- **Allowance for service tie-ins:** Per Addendum 03, allowance approach is permitted
  - **Pro:** Acknowledges uncertainty about existing service locations and connection costs
  - **Con:** May be perceived as incomplete proposal if competitors provide more definitive pricing
- **Defined scope with assumptions:** Price service tie-ins based on assumptions documented in DEL-05-03
  - **Pro:** Appears more thorough
  - **Con:** Higher risk of cost overrun if assumptions prove incorrect

**Recommendation:** Use allowance where explicitly permitted by RFP/addenda; document assumptions clearly for all other items.
