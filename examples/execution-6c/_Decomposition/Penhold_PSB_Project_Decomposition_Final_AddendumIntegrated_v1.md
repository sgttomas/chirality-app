## 4. Addenda Integration Summary (Delta From Base RFP)

**Addendum 01**
- Confirms onsite bidders meeting occurs **July 25** (and none on July 15).  
- Functional program intentionally omits many room dimensions to allow innovation; spaces must at minimum meet building code.

**Addendum 02**
- Confirms “missing pages 62–63” is a numbering/formatting issue; **no missing information**.

**Addendum 03 (Key Impacts to Proposal + Concept)**
- Developable area clarified: **12-acre** functional site (20 acres total; 8 acres dog park/storm pond in flood fringe).  
- **Pickled Sand Storage building removed** from this RFP (to be issued later as separate RFP).  
- Clarifies requirements impacting concept + costing: overhead doors (16 ft), bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar capable roof/orientation, FF&E treatment, site servicing allowance approach, and survey file availability after award.  
- Provides **sample room size ranges** for selected spaces to guide conceptual design where program lacks sizes.
