# Penhold Public Services Building (RFP 2024_004) — Project Decomposition (Phase 4)

## Status
- Gate 2: Approved (SSOW confirmed) — per user instruction
- Current: Phase 4 (Work Packages)

## Addendum Integration Summary (impacts to SSOW/packages)
**Addendum 01 (July 11, 2024)**
- Confirms on-site bidders meeting date (admin only).
- Confirms functional program has intentionally missing room dimensions to allow design flexibility; spaces must meet building code minimums.

**Addendum 02 (July 15, 2024)**
- Confirms “missing pages” were a numbering/formatting issue; no missing information.

**Addendum 03 (July 31, 2024)**
- Removes Pickled Sand Storage Building from this RFP (separate future RFP) — must be excluded from proposal scope and pricing.
- Confirms developable area: 12-acre portion of 20-acre parcel (8 acres are storm pond + dog park on flood fringe not suitable for building).
- Allows cash allowance for service tie-ins (water, wastewater, electricity, communications, gas) — costs do not need to be in proposal.
- Adds/clarifies key technical requirements:
  - All bays require sumps.
  - Minimum overhead door height: 16 ft for main building doors.
  - Direct exhaust ventilation required for fire apparatus bays (two apparatus per bay).
  - Backup generator required to support at least kitchen, meeting room/ICP, and two bathrooms; bay doors require secondary opening mechanisms.
  - Two 2" minimum water fill stations (1x fire apparatus bay, 1x public works bay).
  - Solar-capable roofing required.
  - 40 bunker gear lockers required; locker room ventilation required (not each locker).
  - Wash bay remains an “additional item” separate from base proposal.
