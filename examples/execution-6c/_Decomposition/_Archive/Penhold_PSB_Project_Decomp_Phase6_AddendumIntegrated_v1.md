## Vocabulary Map (best-effort)

| Canonical term | Synonyms / related terms seen in docs | Notes (use discipline) |
|---|---|---|
| Public Services Building (PSB) | Public Services Building; Public Services Facility; Public Works Operations Facility (combined fire hall + public works) | Use **PSB** as shorthand in the proposal; keep full title in Letter of Offer and section headings. |
| Main Building | Public Services Building; main building | Distinguish from ancillary buildings; many addendum technical requirements apply to **main building bays**. |
| Cold Storage Building | cold storage; cold storage building | Treated as in-scope ancillary building per SSOW; confirm exact extent during concept development. |
| Pickled Sand Storage Building | pickled sand storage; pickled sand storage building | **Out of scope** for this RFP per Addendum 03; must be explicitly excluded from base + option pricing. |
| Developable area | developable 12-acre portion; developable portion of parcel | Use this term for siting decisions; remainder includes storm pond + dog park on flood fringe (not for buildings). |
| Flood fringe / flood hazard | 100-year flood fringe; flood hazard area; flood zone | Use this term when describing constraints; reference Town-provided mapping. |
| Owner’s Statement of Requirements (OSR) | OSR; Appendix A | Use OSR as the primary technical requirements source for design briefs. |
| Functional Program | Appendix B program; functional program | Program intentionally omits many dimensions; proponent must size spaces to code minimums + function. |
| Additional / optional items | Additional Option 1–6; Appendix H options; additional items | Pricing must align to Appendix H (wash bay, yard lighting, access control, security/cameras, signage, appliances). |
| Service tie-ins allowance | service connections; utility tie-ins; servicing | Addendum 03 allows a **cash allowance** approach for tie-ins (clarify inclusions/exclusions). |
| Bays | fire apparatus bay; public works bay | Addendum 03 adds bay requirements: sumps, 16’ doors, exhaust ventilation, fill stations, etc. |
| Backup generator | emergency generator; standby generator | Addendum 03 specifies minimum loads (kitchen, meeting/ICP, two bathrooms) + secondary bay door opening. |
| Water fill stations | 2-inch fill stations; fill points | Addendum 03: two (2) minimum 2-inch fill stations (1 fire bay, 1 PW bay). |
| Solar-capable roof | solar-ready roof; PV-ready | Addendum 03: roof must be solar-capable (orientation can support future PV). |

> Note: Some scope items intentionally map to *multiple* deliverables (e.g., SOW-010 Addendum-driven technical requirements cascade into concept drawings + multiple discipline briefs).

### 6.4 Objectives (derived) + mapping (best-effort)
**Result:** PASS (best-effort)

These objectives are derived from the SSOW and RFP evaluation structure. They do **not** add scope; they summarize success criteria.

**Objective list**
- **OBJ-001 Submission compliance:** Provide a complete, signed, and properly formatted submission that is not disqualified.
- **OBJ-002 Qualified team:** Demonstrate a capable design-build team with clear roles and relevant experience.
- **OBJ-003 Coherent concept design:** Provide a dimensioned concept design that meets the OSR + program intent.
- **OBJ-004 Addendum compliance:** Demonstrate that Addendum 01–03 requirements are fully integrated (scope boundary, developable area, technical requirements, allowances).
- **OBJ-005 Discipline design credibility:** Provide clear architectural/civil/structural/mechanical/electrical narratives aligned to RFP 7.1.2.
- **OBJ-006 Project delivery credibility:** Provide a realistic plan for design, permitting, construction, controls, and administration.
- **OBJ-007 Closeout readiness:** Provide commissioning/training/closeout and warranty/deficiency approach aligned to RFP.
- **OBJ-008 Schedule clarity:** Provide a schedule with key milestones and a credible sequencing narrative.
- **OBJ-009 Pricing completeness:** Provide Schedule A + Schedule B pricing that reconciles and includes required options.
- **OBJ-010 Site risk awareness:** Demonstrate awareness of site constraints and integrate them into the concept and approach.

**Objective → primary supporting deliverables (best-effort mapping)**
- OBJ-001: DEL-01-01, DEL-01-02, DEL-01-03, DEL-01-04
- OBJ-002: DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-02-03
- OBJ-003: DEL-03-01, DEL-03-02, DEL-03-03, DEL-03-04

## Coverage & Telemetry (snapshot)

### Coverage metrics
- **SSOW scope items:** 28
- **Packages:** 9
- **Deliverables:** 29
- **Scope items assigned to exactly one package:** 28/28 (100%)
- **Scope items mapped to ≥1 deliverable (best-effort):** 28/28 (100%)
- **Deliverables mapped to ≥1 scope item:** 29/29 (100%)
- **Objectives defined (derived):** 10
- **Objectives supported by ≥1 deliverable (best-effort):** 10/10 (100%)

### Telemetry notes (what is “TBD”)
- Many deliverables list **Responsible = TBD**. This is acceptable for decomposition, but needs assignment during proposal production.
- Optional decisions remain (e.g., whether to include FF&E pricing as an additional item) — captured below as open issues.

## Gate 6 Check (Coverage & Verification)
Please confirm:
1) The **coverage & telemetry** results above are acceptable (no gaps, and mappings reflect intent), and
2) The **open issues list** is acceptable as the tracked set of remaining decisions/assignments.

Once confirmed, Phase 7 can publish a **single consolidated decomposition document** (packages + deliverables + ledger + objectives + vocabulary + change log) as the basis for downstream work.
