## Attributes

### Deliverable Properties
- **Document class:** Technical narrative / Process description
- **Primary audience:** Town of Penhold evaluation team (RFP 2024_004 evaluation)
- **Evaluation weight:** Contributes to Project Delivery Plan scoring (10 points) [Source: Decomposition Section 15]
- **Format requirement:** Integrated into proposal PDF submission (≤15 MB total) [Source: Decomposition §3, C-01]
- **Content scope:** Five integrated narratives covering commissioning approach, training plan, closeout procedures, deficiencies management, warranty support [Source: _CONTEXT.md]
- **Value demonstration:** This deliverable provides competitive advantage by demonstrating: (1) lifecycle understanding of commissioning from design through warranty; (2) facility-specific approach tailored to integrated Fire Hall + Public Works operations; (3) Owner-centric training and closeout that ensures operational confidence; (4) responsive warranty support that reduces Owner risk and builds long-term trust. Beyond meeting compliance, a credible commissioning narrative signals project delivery competence that differentiates the proposal. [Source: Lensing A-006, Lens A:evaluative:applying]
