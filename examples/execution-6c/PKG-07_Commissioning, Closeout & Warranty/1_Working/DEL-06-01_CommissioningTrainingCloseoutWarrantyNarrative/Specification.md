## Requirements

### R-001: RFP Section Compliance (Mandatory)
**Requirement:** The narrative must meet all requirements specified in RFP Sections 7.3.6 (commissioning and closeout), 7.3.7 (warranty), and 7.6 (warranty period and obligations).

### R-011: Commissioning Personnel Qualifications (TBD)
[Source: Lensing B-003, E-001]

**Requirement:** **TBD** - Does the RFP require disclosure of specific commissioning agent qualifications or certifications (e.g., CxA, BCxP, ACG, PE/P.Eng)?

**Source:** Pending verification against RFP Section 7.3.6

**Criticality:** **TBD** - If RFP mandates specific certifications, this becomes MANDATORY (Pass/Fail)

**Verification:** Credential verification against DEL-07-02 resumes

**Note:** R-010 references "qualified commissioning team credentials (DEL-07-02)" without specifying required qualifications. This potential mandatory requirement needs RFP verification.

### Canonical Definitions

[Source: Lensing B-004 - normalization of cross-document term "substantial completion"]

The following terms are defined canonically for use across all four documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure):

**Substantial Completion:** The stage of project completion when:
1. All building systems are functional and operating as designed
2. Occupancy permit has been obtained from the authority having jurisdiction
3. Only minor deficiencies remain that do not materially affect building operations or life safety
4. The building is suitable for Owner occupancy and use for its intended purpose
5. All required commissioning functional performance tests have been completed with acceptable results

**Final Completion:** The stage when:
1. All deficiencies identified at or after substantial completion have been corrected and verified
2. All closeout documentation has been delivered and accepted by Owner
3. All warranty certificates and contact information have been provided
4. Training has been completed and documented
5. Final payment conditions have been met

**Final Acceptance Authority:** [Source: Lensing F-006]
**TBD** - Designate single authority for final deliverable acceptance:
- _CONTEXT.md names "Commissioning Lead / PM" as responsible party
- Verification table names multiple parties for different requirements
- **Proposed:** Commissioning Lead holds primary authority; Proposal Manager holds final sign-off authority for proposal submission

### Supporting Documentation References

The narrative should reference (but not duplicate) the following supporting documentation to be produced during project execution:

- Commissioning Plan (detailed, to be developed during design phase)
- Equipment-specific commissioning protocols (to be developed during procurement/construction)
- Training materials and manuals (to be developed during construction)
- As-built documentation (to be compiled during closeout)
- Operation and Maintenance manuals (to be compiled from vendor submittals)
- Warranty certificates and contact information (to be provided at substantial completion)

[**ASSUMPTION** based on standard Design-Build documentation requirements]

### Cross-Deliverable Documentation

This deliverable must maintain consistency with:
- **DEL-01-01:** Compliance matrix entries for commissioning/closeout/warranty requirements
- **DEL-03-01:** Design methodology narrative (design phase commissioning planning)
- **DEL-04-01:** Construction methodology narrative (construction phase commissioning integration)
- **DEL-07-02:** Key team member resumes (commissioning lead qualifications)
- **DEL-08-01:** Project schedule (commissioning milestones and durations)
- **DEL-09-01:** Risk register (commissioning-related risks and mitigations)

## Notes

- **Pass 1 Generation:** This specification was generated in Pass 1 of the 4_DOCUMENTS enrichment cycle
- **Pass 2 Consistency Check:** Cross-document consistency verified:
  - All entities in Datasheet have corresponding requirements in Specification (commissioning phases, training scope, closeout elements, deficiencies management, warranty period)
  - All requirements have rationale in Guidance (Principles P-01 through P-05)
  - All requirements have verification methods in Procedure (Steps 1-13 verification checkpoints)
  - Terminology is consistent across all four documents
- **TBD Items:** Many requirements are inferred from standard practice because RFP PDF text is not directly accessible. Verification against actual RFP text is essential before proposal submission.
- **Standards assumptions:** All standards listed are based on typical facility type and discipline requirements. Actual applicable standards must be verified from RFP and Owner requirements.
- **Criticality ratings:** Assigned based on typical Design-Build RFP structures; actual criticality should be verified against RFP evaluation criteria and mandatory requirements.
- **Cross-deliverable coordination:** NOT_TRACKED dependency mode means coordination is managed externally; however, logical consistency across deliverables is essential for proposal credibility.
- **Pass 3 Semantic Lensing:** Warranted items from `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` incorporated:
  - A-001, C-001, F-001: Conformance baseline status added to R-001
