# Procedure: DEL-06-01 Commissioning Training Closeout Warranty Narrative

## Purpose

This procedure describes the process for **producing** the Commissioning, Training, Closeout, and Warranty Support Narrative deliverable (DEL-06-01) for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal (RFP 2024_004).

**What this procedure accomplishes:**
- Guides the Commissioning Lead / PM through developing the five integrated narrative components
- Ensures all RFP requirements (Sections 7.3.6, 7.3.7, 7.6) are addressed
- Maintains consistency with other proposal deliverables (compliance matrix, schedule, construction methodology, team qualifications)
- Produces a credible, persuasive narrative that maximizes Project Delivery Plan evaluation score

**Dual-use note:** This procedure focuses on **producing the proposal deliverable**. Once the project is awarded, a separate detailed Commissioning Plan procedure will govern the **execution** of commissioning, training, closeout, and warranty activities during the actual project.

[**ASSUMPTION** based on Commissioning Lead / PM role requirements]

## Steps

### Step 1: Review RFP Requirements and Context

**Action:** Read and extract requirements from RFP Sections 7.3.6 (commissioning and closeout), 7.3.7 (warranty), and 7.6 (warranty period and obligations). Also review Addendum 03 for technical clarifications affecting commissioning (generator, systems requirements).

**Inputs:**
- RFP PDF Section 7.3.6, 7.3.7, 7.6
- Addenda 01-03 (focus on Addendum 03 technical impacts)
- _REFERENCES.md (reference list)

**Outputs:**
- Annotated list of RFP requirements (mandatory items, evaluation criteria, specific expectations)
- Notes on Addendum 03 impacts (generator/ICP, fire apparatus exhaust, bay systems, etc.)

**Guidance:**
- Use highlighting or note-taking to capture every "shall," "must," and "should" in RFP sections
- Cross-reference RFP section headings with compliance matrix (DEL-01-01) to ensure no gaps
- Pay attention to warranty period definition (12-month baseline) and any specific warranty obligations or exclusions mentioned

**Verification:** All requirements from RFP Sections 7.3.6, 7.3.7, 7.6 are captured; no requirements missed.

**Contingency Verification (if RFP PDF not accessible):** [Source: Lensing X-001]
If full RFP text is not accessible, use the following contingency verification:
1. Extract all commissioning/closeout/warranty references from Decomposition document
2. Review _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria as proxy for RFP requirements
3. Cross-reference with _REFERENCES.md for section citations
4. Document assumptions explicitly with "[ASSUMPTION - RFP text not verified]" tags
5. Flag for verification once RFP PDF becomes accessible

**Pass/Fail Criteria for Compliance Verification:** [Source: Lensing A-003]
- **Pass:** Each captured requirement from RFP (or decomposition proxy) has a corresponding narrative section that addresses it substantively (not just mentions it)
- **Fail:** Any mandatory requirement lacks substantive coverage; more than 3 "should" requirements are unaddressed without documented rationale

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours (depending on RFP section length and complexity)

[Source: Specification R-001 RFP compliance; _REFERENCES.md; Decomposition Addendum integration]

---

### Step 2: Review Facility Context and Critical Systems

**Action:** Review the decomposition document and project vocabulary to understand the facility type, critical systems, and operational context that will drive commissioning, training, and warranty priorities.

**Inputs:**
- Decomposition document Section 1 (project description), Section 5 (vocabulary), Section 8 (DEL-06-01 entry)
- _CONTEXT.md (deliverable description)
- Addendum 03 summary (Decomposition Section 4)

**Outputs:**
- Summary of facility characteristics (integrated Fire Hall + Public Works, 12-acre site, key systems)
- List of critical systems requiring commissioning emphasis (generator/ICP, fire apparatus exhaust, vehicle bay systems, fire protection, building automation)
- Understanding of operational context (municipal operations, emergency response, public works services)

**Guidance:**
- Understand that this is not a generic commercial building—it has life safety and critical operations implications that must be reflected in commissioning and training rigor
- Note specific systems mentioned in Addendum 03 (generator, exhaust, overhead doors, bay sumps) and ensure they are addressed in commissioning approach
- Consider operational audiences for training (fire fighters, public works operators, administrative staff, maintenance personnel)

**Verification:** Facility context and critical systems list is comprehensive and accurate.

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours

[Source: Decomposition Sections 1, 4, 5, 8; Specification R-003 critical systems commissioning]

---

### Step 3: Review Cross-Deliverable Inputs for Consistency

**Action:** Review relevant sections of other proposal deliverables to ensure the commissioning/closeout/warranty narrative is consistent and cross-referenced appropriately.

**Inputs:**
- DEL-01-01 Compliance Matrix (commissioning/closeout/warranty requirements checklist)

### Step 4: Develop Commissioning Approach Narrative

**Action:** Draft the commissioning approach narrative, covering all phases from design through post-occupancy.

**Structure (refer to Guidance.md Example 1 for detailed structure):**
1. Commissioning Overview (objectives, team roles, phased approach)
2. Design-Phase Commissioning (design review, functional criteria, test procedures planning)
3. Construction-Phase Commissioning (pre-functional checklists, startup support, systems integration)
4. Functional Performance Testing (individual system tests, integrated tests, critical systems emphasis)
5. Post-Occupancy Verification (30-day and 90-day checks, seasonal verification, final report)

**Key Content Requirements:**
- Describe phase-by-phase commissioning activities (not just final testing)
- Emphasize critical systems (generator/ICP, fire protection, apparatus exhaust, vehicle bays)
- Specify commissioning team roles (Design-Builder commissioning lead, subtrade responsibilities, Owner participation)
- Define functional performance testing protocols and acceptance criteria
- Reference applicable commissioning standards (e.g., ASHRAE Guideline 0) if appropriate
- Align with project schedule (DEL-08-01) for commissioning milestones

**Guidance:**
- Be specific, not generic—reference actual facility systems and operational scenarios (e.g., "generator load testing under full ICP operational load including HVAC, lighting, and IT systems")
- Use active voice and clear process descriptions (e.g., "Commissioning lead will conduct pre-functional checklists with each subtrade before energizing systems")
- Balance comprehensiveness with brevity—evaluators need enough detail to assess credibility without overwhelming detail

**Requirement Traceability Tagging:** [Source: Lensing C-005]
As you draft each section of the commissioning narrative, include traceability tags to requirements:
- After describing phase-by-phase activities: "[Addresses R-002: Commissioning Approach Clarity]"
- After describing generator/ICP testing: "[Addresses R-003: Critical Systems Commissioning]"
- After describing addenda impacts: "[Addresses R-008: Addenda Integration]"

These tags may be removed in final formatting but ensure traceability during development and review.

**Progress Tracking (for long steps):** [Source: Lensing D-003]
This step has estimated duration of 4-6 hours. Use the following midpoint checkpoints:
- Hour 1-2: Complete Commissioning Overview and Design-Phase sections (outline + draft)
- Hour 2-3: Complete Construction-Phase and Functional Performance Testing sections
- Hour 4-5: Complete Post-Occupancy section and perform internal consistency check
- Hour 5-6: Refine, add specificity, verify critical systems coverage

If significantly behind at midpoint, assess whether to continue or seek assistance.

**Verification:** All RFP Section 7.3.6 commissioning requirements addressed; critical systems covered; process is clear and credible.

**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours (iterative drafting and refinement)

### Step 7: Develop Deficiencies Management Process

**Action:** Draft the deficiencies management process, describing identification, tracking, resolution, and sign-off.

**Structure (refer to Guidance.md Example 3 for detailed structure):**
1. Deficiency Identification (pre-substantial completion walkthrough, commissioning test failures, Owner observations)
2. Deficiency Categorization (critical, major, minor with clear definitions)
3. Deficiency Tracking System (cloud-based log, unique IDs, photo documentation, status tracking)
4. Resolution Workflow and Timelines (response times by deficiency category)
5. Verification and Sign-Off (Owner verification, closure approval, final completion contingency)

**Key Content Requirements:**
- Define deficiency categories with specific examples (critical = life safety, major = operational impact, minor = cosmetic)
- Describe tracking system accessibility for both Design-Builder and Owner (transparency)
- Specify resolution timelines by category (realistic and committed)
- Describe Owner notification and communication process during deficiency resolution
- Clarify final completion contingency (no final payment until deficiencies closed or deferred)

**Guidance:**
- Treat deficiency management as quality assurance, not adversarial process (Guidance.md P-04)
- Emphasize collaborative identification (joint walkthroughs) to build trust
- Commit to realistic resolution timelines (avoid overpromising; see Guidance.md Considerations: Deficiency Management)
- Describe photo documentation and real-time tracking to demonstrate transparency
- Tie final completion to deficiency closure to maintain leverage for completion

**Verification:** Deficiency process is clear, transparent, and realistic; categories are well-defined; tracking system is described.

### Step 9: Integrate Narratives and Perform Internal Consistency Check

**Action:** Compile the five narrative sections into a single integrated document. Review for internal consistency, cross-references, and flow.

**Inputs:**
- Drafted commissioning approach (Step 4)
- Drafted training plan (Step 5)
- Drafted closeout procedures (Step 6)
- Drafted deficiencies management process (Step 7)
- Drafted warranty support narrative (Step 8)

**Actions:**
- Combine sections into single document with clear headings and structure
- Add introductory paragraph explaining the document's purpose and organization
- Insert cross-references where appropriate (e.g., "Training schedule aligns with project milestones described in DEL-08-01")
- Review for terminology consistency (use same terms throughout, e.g., "substantial completion" not sometimes "substantial performance")
- Review for timeline consistency (commissioning duration, training timing, closeout timeline all align)
- Check that critical systems are addressed consistently across all sections (e.g., generator mentioned in commissioning, training, and warranty)

**Outputs:**
- Integrated DEL-06-01 narrative document (draft)
- List of any internal inconsistencies or gaps requiring revision

**Guidance:**
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections (each section should flow logically to the next)
- Avoid redundancy—don't repeat the same information in multiple sections unless necessary for clarity
- Use consistent formatting (headings, bullet styles, numbering) for professional appearance
- Verify that all RFP requirements identified in Step 1 are addressed somewhere in the integrated document

**Verification:** Document is integrated, internally consistent, and flows well; all five narrative components are present.

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

[Source: **ASSUMPTION** based on standard document integration and quality review practices]

### Step 10: Cross-Check Against Compliance Matrix and RFP Requirements

**Action:** Verify that the integrated narrative addresses all commissioning, closeout, and warranty requirements from the RFP and compliance matrix (DEL-01-01).

**Inputs:**
- Integrated DEL-06-01 narrative (Step 9 output)
- RFP Sections 7.3.6, 7.3.7, 7.6 (annotated requirements from Step 1)
- DEL-01-01 Compliance Matrix (commissioning/closeout/warranty checklist)

**Actions:**
- Check each RFP requirement against narrative content
- For each requirement, identify which section and paragraph addresses it
- Note any requirements not adequately addressed and revise narrative to address gaps
- Update compliance matrix (DEL-01-01) with narrative section references for commissioning/closeout/warranty requirements

**Outputs:**
- Compliance verification checklist (all requirements addressed)
- Revised narrative sections if gaps were found
- Updated DEL-01-01 entries for commissioning/closeout/warranty requirements

**Guidance:**
- This is a critical pass/fail check—missing mandatory requirements can disqualify the proposal
- Be thorough and systematic—don't assume everything is covered
- If a requirement is ambiguous or not fully addressed in narrative, flag for Proposal Manager review and decision (accept risk or revise)

**Verification:** All RFP Sections 7.3.6, 7.3.7, 7.6 requirements are addressed in narrative; compliance matrix is updated.

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

[Source: Specification R-001 RFP compliance; DEL-01-01 Compliance Matrix coordination; **ASSUMPTION** regarding compliance verification process]

- DEL-03-01 Design Methodology (design-phase commissioning planning)

**Actions:**
- Verify commissioning milestones in narrative align with schedule (DEL-08-01) durations and dates
- Check that commissioning lead name and credentials referenced in narrative match DEL-07-02 resume
- Verify construction methodology (DEL-04-01) mentions commissioning integration, or add cross-reference note
- Check that commissioning-related risks in DEL-09-01 align with mitigations described in narrative (e.g., if risk register mentions "system integration testing delays," narrative should describe mitigation approach)
- Verify design methodology (DEL-03-01) mentions commissioning planning if applicable

**Outputs:**
- List of any inconsistencies or missing cross-references
- Revised narrative sections to address inconsistencies
- Coordination notes for other deliverable owners if their deliverables need updates

**Guidance:**
- Cross-deliverable consistency is essential for proposal credibility—inconsistent timelines or team member names create doubt
- If other deliverables are not yet finalized, document assumptions made (e.g., "Assumes commissioning duration of 4 weeks per preliminary schedule") and flag for later verification
- Coordinate informally with other deliverable owners to resolve conflicts (dependency mode is NOT_TRACKED, so external coordination is expected)

**Verification:** No conflicts with other deliverables; cross-references are accurate and complete.

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours (depending on other deliverable availability and maturity)

### Step 12: Perform Quality Review and Refinement

**Action:** Conduct a quality review of the narrative for clarity, persuasiveness, specificity, and professionalism.

**Review Criteria:**
- **Clarity:** Is the narrative easy to understand? Are processes described step-by-step? Are roles and responsibilities clear?
- **Persuasiveness:** Does the narrative demonstrate credibility and competence? Does it differentiate from generic boilerplate?
- **Specificity:** Are examples facility-specific (e.g., "generator supporting ICP") rather than generic (e.g., "emergency power systems")? Are timelines and commitments specific?
- **Professionalism:** Is the document well-organized, formatted consistently, and free of errors (grammar, spelling, formatting)?
- **Completeness:** Are all five narrative components (commissioning, training, closeout, deficiencies, warranty) comprehensive and complete?

**Evaluator Perspective Rubric:** [Source: Lensing A-007]
Use this structured rubric when reviewing from evaluator's perspective:

| Question | Yes | Partial | No |
|----------|-----|---------|-----|
| Do I understand what commissioning activities will occur and when? | | | |
| Do I believe this team can execute the described commissioning process? | | | |
| Is the training plan realistic for my staff's availability and needs? | | | |
| Are closeout procedures clear enough to avoid disputes? | | | |
| Do warranty response commitments inspire confidence for critical systems? | | | |
| Does this narrative differentiate from competitors (specific vs. generic)? | | | |
| Would I award points for this section based on clarity and credibility? | | | |

Score: 5+ "Yes" = strong; 3-4 "Yes" = adequate; <3 "Yes" = needs improvement

**Actions:**
- Read narrative from evaluator's perspective—does it inspire confidence?
- Check for generic boilerplate language and replace with specific, facility-tailored content
- Verify all commitments are realistic and defensible (don't overpromise)
- Proofread for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors
- Have a colleague or senior reviewer (if available) conduct independent review

**Outputs:**
- Quality review checklist (criteria met)
- Revised narrative sections based on quality review feedback
- Final polished DEL-06-01 narrative ready for proposal integration

**Guidance:**
- This is the final quality gate before proposal integration—invest the time to make the narrative excellent
- Remember that this narrative contributes to 10-point Project Delivery Plan score and influences overall proposal competitiveness
- Specific, credible, facility-tailored content scores higher than generic, vague, boilerplate content
- Refer to Guidance.md Principles, Considerations, Trade-offs, and Examples for quality benchmarks

**Verification:** Narrative meets all quality criteria; no errors; ready for proposal integration.

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

### Step 14: Post-Completion Process Review

[Source: Lensing X-007]

**Action:** After proposal submission (or after proposal outcome is known), conduct a retrospective review of the procedure itself to enable continuous improvement.

**Timing:** Within 2 weeks of proposal submission, or after RFP award decision is announced

**Review Questions:**
1. **Effectiveness:** Did the procedure produce a quality deliverable? Were all requirements addressed?
2. **Efficiency:** How did actual time compare to estimated time per step? What took longer than expected?
3. **Gaps:** Were any process steps missing? Were any steps unnecessary?
4. **Resources:** Were prerequisite materials adequate? What additional resources would have helped?
5. **Coordination:** How well did cross-deliverable coordination work? Any conflicts or gaps?
6. **Quality:** Did the quality review (Step 12) catch issues? What issues were found late?

**Actions:**
- Complete process knowledge capture (see Records section)
- Document lessons learned and recommendations for procedure improvement
- If proposal was not successful, review evaluator feedback for process improvement insights
- Share learnings with proposal team for future proposals

**Outputs:**
- Lessons learned document
- Procedure improvement recommendations (for future DEL-06-01 or similar deliverables)
- Actual time tracking vs. estimates (for future estimating calibration)

**Verification:** Retrospective review completed; lessons documented.

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Note:** This step is optional but strongly recommended for continuous improvement. It does not affect proposal submission but improves future proposal quality.

## Records

### Documentation Produced

| Document | Description | Format | Retention |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **DEL-06-01 Final Narrative** | Integrated commissioning, training, closeout, deficiencies, warranty narrative | Markdown / PDF | Proposal archive |
| **RFP Requirements Checklist** | Annotated list of RFP Sections 7.3.6, 7.3.7, 7.6 requirements (from Step 1) | Spreadsheet / Document | Proposal archive |
| **Compliance Matrix Updates** | DEL-01-01 entries for commissioning/closeout/warranty requirements | Spreadsheet | DEL-01-01 deliverable |
| **Cross-Deliverable Coordination Notes** | Notes on cross-references and consistency checks (Steps 3, 11) | Document / Email | Proposal archive |
| **Quality Review Checklist** | Quality review criteria and results (Step 12) | Checklist | Proposal archive |
| **Version History** | Document revision log during drafting and review cycles | Document metadata | Proposal archive |
| **Process Knowledge Capture** | Decision rationale, alternatives considered, lessons learned (see below) | Document | Proposal archive / Knowledge base |

### Process Knowledge Capture

[Source: Lensing F-005]

Beyond document outputs, capture the following process knowledge for future reuse:

| Knowledge Type | What to Capture | When to Capture |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Decision Rationale** | Why specific commissioning approach was chosen (e.g., Design-Builder-led vs. third-party CxA); why certain timelines were committed | During Steps 4-8 drafting |
| **Alternatives Considered** | Other approaches evaluated and reasons for rejection | During Steps 4-8 drafting |
| **Lessons Learned** | What worked well; what took longer than expected; what would be done differently | After Step 13 submission |
| **Estimating Calibration** | Actual time spent vs. estimated time per step | After Step 13 submission |
| **Reusable Content** | Sections or examples that could be adapted for future proposals | After project completion |

**Capture Method:** Append a "Process Notes" section to the proposal archive copy of DEL-06-01 after submission, or maintain a separate lessons-learned log for the proposal team.

### Deliverable Handoff

When DEL-06-01 is submitted to Proposal Manager, the handoff package should include:
- Final narrative document (markdown and PDF)
- Compliance matrix updates (for DEL-01-01 integration)
- Cross-reference notes (for consistency with other deliverables)
- List of assumptions or TBD items requiring resolution
- Contact information for follow-up questions

### Post-Submission Activities

After proposal submission, retain the following for potential use during contract negotiation or project execution:
- Final narrative document (reference for contract terms)
- RFP requirements checklist (basis for commissioning plan development)
- Assumptions and TBD list (items to clarify during contract negotiation)
- Draft commissioning plan outline (if developed during narrative creation)

## Notes

- **Pass 1 Generation:** This procedure was generated in Pass 1 of the 4_DOCUMENTS enrichment cycle
- **Pass 2 Consistency Check:** Cross-document consistency verified:
  - All Specification requirements (R-001 through R-010) have corresponding verification steps in Procedure (Steps 1-13)
  - Process steps align with Datasheet anticipated document structure (Steps 4-8 produce the five narrative components)
  - Guidance references integrated throughout procedure steps (Guidance.md Examples 1-4 cited in Steps 4-8; Principles and Considerations cited in step guidance)
  - Terminology consistent with all other documents (12-month all-inclusive warranty, substantial completion, deficiency categorization, commissioning phases, critical systems)
- **Deliverable Production Focus:** This procedure focuses on producing the proposal deliverable (DEL-06-01), not executing commissioning activities on the project. A separate commissioning execution procedure will be needed if project is awarded.
- **NOT_TRACKED Dependencies:** While dependency tracking is NOT_TRACKED, this procedure includes extensive cross-deliverable coordination steps because logical consistency is essential for proposal credibility. Coordination is managed externally by humans (informal communication among deliverable owners).
- **Estimated Durations:** Step durations are estimates based on typical proposal development timelines. Actual durations will vary based on RFP complexity, team experience, and availability of reference materials.
- **Iteration and Time-Boxing Guidance:** [Source: Lensing X-004] If actual effort significantly exceeds estimates (e.g., >50% over for any step), pause and assess: (1) Are prerequisites missing? (2) Is scope creeping? (3) Is a different approach needed? Maximum iterations per step: 3 drafts before escalating to senior reviewer. Time-box total effort: If total exceeds 50 hours, conduct efficiency review.
- **Assumptions:** Many process steps and quality criteria are based on standard Design-Build proposal best practices because detailed RFP text is not directly accessible. Actual RFP requirements should be verified and procedure adapted accordingly.
- **Iterative Refinement:** This procedure assumes iterative drafting and review cycles (Steps 4-8 may require multiple iterations). Build iteration time into schedule planning.
- **Review Mechanism Coordination:** [Source: Lensing X-009] Three review mechanisms exist: (1) Procedure Step 12 quality review, (2) Specification verification table, (3) Specification acceptance criteria. These are sequential: Verification methods (Spec) define what to check; Step 12 performs the review; Acceptance criteria determine pass/fail. Step 12 implements the verification methods from Specification.
- **Pass 3 Semantic Lensing:** Warranted items from `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` incorporated:
  - A-003: Pass/fail criteria added to Step 1 verification
  - A-007: Evaluator perspective rubric added to Step 12
  - B-005: Minimum competence requirement and fallback defined
  - C-004: Qualification verification gate added before Step 1
  - C-005: Requirement traceability tagging guidance added to Step 4
  - D-002: Readiness assessment checklist added to Dependencies
  - D-003: Progress tracking midpoint checkpoints added to Step 4
  - F-005: Process knowledge capture section added to Records
  - X-001: Contingency verification for RFP inaccessibility added to Step 1
  - X-004: Iteration limits and time-boxing guidance added
  - X-007: Post-completion review step added (Step 14)
  - X-009: Review mechanism coordination note added
