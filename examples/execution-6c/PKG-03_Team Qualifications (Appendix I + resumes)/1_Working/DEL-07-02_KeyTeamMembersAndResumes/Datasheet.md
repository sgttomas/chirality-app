**Source:** RFP Section 7.1.7 — location: page 18 of 72

### 2.4 Scoring Weight
Part of "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" criterion worth 15 points (maximum).

**TBD — Per-Deliverable Weighting:** The 15-point allocation is shared across PKG-03 deliverables (DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-07-03). The breakdown of points between firm experience, key member resumes, and subtrade list is not specified in the RFP. *(Lensing Item A-011: SourcePath Datasheet.md Section 2.4)*

**Source:** RFP Section 8.3 Scoring Matrix — location: page 26 of 72

- Design-Builder Project Manager
- Lead Architect
- Structural Engineer
- Mechanical Engineer
- Electrical Engineer
- Civil Engineer
- Construction Manager
- Site Superintendent
- Commissioning Coordinator

**Role Selection Authority:** **TBD** — What authoritative source defines the required key roles list? RFP Section 7.1.7 does not prescribe an exhaustive list. Role selection authority defaults to Proposal Manager interpretation pending RFP clarification or issuer guidance. *(Lensing Item A-001: SourcePath Datasheet.md Section 2.5)*

**Potential Additional Roles (TBD):** Given the project scope (site with wetlands, flood fringe constraints, landscaping needs), additional key roles may be warranted:
- Landscape Architect
- Environmental Consultant
- Interior Designer
- Geotechnical Engineer

*(Lensing Item C-003: SourcePath Datasheet.md Section 2.5)*

**Planned Team Size:** **TBD** — Total number of key members to be proposed not yet determined. Requires finalization based on actual project team composition. *(Lensing Item B-003: SourcePath Datasheet.md Section 2.5)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — inferred from typical Design-Build project delivery structure and RFP Section 7 requirements (design methodology, construction methodology, commissioning)

### 2.6 Required Resume Content
**TBD** — RFP Section 7.1.7 requires resumes "highlighting relevant experience" but does not specify mandatory resume sections.

Typical resume content includes:
- Name and professional designation(s)
- Role on this project
- Years of experience (see definition note below)
- Relevant project experience (similar facilities)
- Education and certifications
- Availability statement

**Content Prescription Note:** The above content list is suggestive, not prescriptive. Exhaustive documentation requirements remain undefined pending Proposal Manager determination. *(Lensing Item F-003: SourcePath Datasheet.md Section 2.6)*

**Years of Experience Definition:** **TBD** — Measurement definition needed (total career years? relevant discipline years? years in specific role?). Must be consistent with Specification and Procedure definitions. *(Lensing Item B-004: Multi-document normalization required)*

**Essential Evidence Status:** All fundamental personnel data elements (name, designation, role, availability) remain placeholder pending HR/Team Admin input. No confirmed data source yet available. *(Lensing Item B-001: SourcePath Datasheet.md Section 2.6)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — inferred from standard practice; RFP Section 7.1.7 requires "relevant experience" highlighting
