# Guidance: DEL-07-02 Key Team Members and Resumes

**Document ID:** DEL-07-02
**Deliverable:** Key Team Members and Resumes
**Package:** PKG-03 Team Qualifications (Appendix I + resumes)
**Version:** Draft v1.1 (Pass 3 - Semantic Lensing Enriched)
**Date:** 2026-02-04

---

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Why This Deliverable Exists
This deliverable demonstrates to the Town of Penhold that the Design-Builder has assembled a qualified, experienced team capable of successfully delivering the Public Services Building project using a Design-Build methodology.

**Source:** Decomposition Section 8 (DEL-07-02 purpose); RFP Section 8.3 (evaluation criterion "Project Team and Firms")

### 1.2 Downstream Use
The Evaluation Committee will assess this deliverable to:
1. Evaluate the qualifications and experience of key team members
2. Assess the team's fit for the specific project scope (combined Fire Hall + Public Works facility)
3. Gauge the credibility of the Design-Builder's ability to deliver on commitments made in other proposal sections
4. Assign up to 15 points (of 100 total) for "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)"

**Evaluator Perspective Gap:** No guidance exists on how the team's worth should be assessed from the evaluator's perspective — what makes one team "worth" 15 points vs. 10 points? Self-assessment guidance needed. *(Lensing Item C-008: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 1.2)*

**Source:** RFP Section 8.3 Scoring Matrix (page 26); ASSUMPTION — inferred from evaluation purpose

### 1.3 Strategic Importance
This deliverable carries significant scoring weight (15 points) and directly supports OBJ-006: "Demonstrate a strong team & firms."

A strong presentation of key personnel can:
- Build confidence in the Design-Builder's capability
- Differentiate the proposal from competitors
- Demonstrate understanding of project complexity and requirements
- Show commitment through availability statements

**Worth-Centered Competence Alignment:** The guidance notes strategic importance but does not provide rationale for how competence alignment with project worth (value to the Owner) should be communicated. Consider framing team qualifications in terms of value delivered, not just credentials held. *(Lensing Item D-007: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 1.3)*

**Self-Appraisal Guidance:** **TBD** — No guidance on how to self-appraise the team's proficiency before submission. The Guidance addresses what to present but not how to assess whether the presentation is strong enough to be competitive. *(Lensing Item F-007: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 1.3)*

**Differentiation Criteria:** The statement that the deliverable can "differentiate the proposal" is motivational but not actionable. **TBD** — Define concrete differentiation criteria (what distinguishes a 15-point team from a 10-point team). *(Lensing Item F-008: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 1.3)*

**Source:** Decomposition Section 6 (OBJ-006); ASSUMPTION — derived from competitive proposal context

---

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Relevance Over Volume
**Principle:** Focus on experience directly relevant to the project scope.

The RFP explicitly requires resumes to "highlight relevant experience." Evaluators are assessing fit, not simply quantity of experience.

**Relevant experience types for this project:**
- Municipal facilities (Fire Halls, Public Works operations facilities, emergency services buildings)
- Design-Build project delivery
- Combined-use facilities (multi-department or multi-function buildings)
- Alberta projects (familiarity with provincial codes, climate, procurement practices)

**Source:** RFP Section 7.1.7 ("highlighting relevant experience"); ASSUMPTION — derived from project context (municipal owner, combined Fire Hall + Public Works scope per RFP Section 7.1)

### 2.2 Credibility Through Specificity
**Principle:** Provide concrete project examples and measurable outcomes.

Generic claims ("extensive experience") are less persuasive than specific examples:
- Name of comparable project
- Role and responsibilities
- Project size/budget
- Delivery outcomes (on time, on budget, client satisfaction)

**Delivery Outcomes Evidence:** The guidance recommends including delivery outcomes but does not specify whether these outcomes must be evidenced (e.g., owner reference, contract close-out documentation) or can be claimed without verification. Consider noting "Owner reference available" for substantiated claims. *(Lensing Item F-005: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.2)*

**Insight Beyond Credentials:** The guidance focuses on factual credentials but lacks direction on demonstrating insight/judgment in project narratives. Consider adding how the team member's judgment or problem-solving approach contributed to project outcomes, particularly in complex Design-Build trade-offs. *(Lensing Item B-005: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.2)*

**Operational Competence Presentation:** Structure presentation of delivery outcomes as competence evidence: schedule adherence (%), budget performance (under/over %), quality metrics (deficiency rates), client satisfaction indicators. *(Lensing Item D-005: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.2)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from proposal evaluation best practices

### 2.3 Team Cohesion
**Principle:** Present the team as an integrated unit, not a collection of individuals.

Evaluators assess whether the team can work together effectively. Consider:
- Have key members worked together before?
- Do their roles have clear interfaces and no gaps?
- Is there a clear leadership structure (Project Manager, discipline leads)?

**Procedural Leadership Gap:** The guidance discusses integrated team presentation but does not address who provides procedural leadership for assembling team qualifications content. Identify the production process leader (typically Proposal Manager). *(Lensing Item A-006: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.3)*

**Holistic Project Coverage:** Present how the team as a whole covers all project dimensions (design, construction, commissioning, administration). Consider a team coverage matrix showing which members lead each project phase. *(Lensing Item B-012: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.3)*

**Integrated Team Experience Narrative:** Present integrated team experience across all project phases, not just each member in isolation. Show collective coverage of design + construction + commissioning + warranty phases. *(Lensing Item D-006: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.3)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from Design-Build delivery model requiring integrated design + construction coordination (RFP Section 7 scope descriptions)

### 2.4 Availability = Commitment
**Principle:** Explicit availability statements demonstrate commitment and build trust.

The RFP does not mandate availability statements, but the acceptance criteria for this deliverable includes "availability." Confirming that key members are committed to the project schedule:
- Reduces perceived risk of team changes mid-project
- Demonstrates realistic resource planning
- Aligns with the detailed project schedule (DEL-08-01)

**Substitution Protocol:** The commitment framing lacks a structured position on continuity guarantees or substitution protocols. **TBD** — If a key member must be replaced, what is the principled framework for substitution commitments? Consider including: (a) commitment to equivalent or superior replacement, (b) Owner notification and approval process, (c) minimum overlap/transition period. *(Lensing Item B-013: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 2.4)*

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria; Decomposition (DEL-07-02 description includes "availability"); ASSUMPTION — inferred from evaluation risk assessment considerations

### 2.5 Professional Credibility
**Principle:** Highlight professional designations and certifications relevant to the project.

Professional registration (P.Eng, P.Arch) is a regulatory requirement in Alberta for engineering and architectural work. Including designations:
- Demonstrates compliance with professional practice standards
- Builds confidence in technical capability
- Shows alignment with project requirements (design services, code compliance, permitting)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from Alberta professional practice requirements (APEGA, AAA); RFP Section 7.1 design scope requiring professional seals for permit submission

---

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Identifying "Key Members"
**Consideration:** Which team members should be classified as "key"?

The RFP does not define "key members" exhaustively. Consider:
- **Roles with direct Owner interface:** Project Manager, Lead Architect, Construction Manager
- **Roles with regulatory responsibility:** Professional Engineers (structural, mechanical, electrical, civil) who will seal drawings for permit
- **Roles with critical delivery functions:** Site Superintendent, Commissioning Coordinator
- **Roles with specialized scope:** Health & Safety Coordinator (if significant), sustainability/energy specialist (if highlighted in Design Brief)

**Merit-Based Role Ranking:** The guidance lists considerations for identifying key members but does not explain the merit-based reasoning for why certain roles are ranked as "key" over others. Consider developing a ranked merit framework based on: (a) Owner interface frequency, (b) regulatory authority level, (c) delivery criticality, (d) specialized expertise scarcity. *(Lensing Item A-009: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 3.1)*

**Competent Mastery Thresholds:** **TBD** — What level of experience constitutes "competent mastery" for each key role? Should minimum years of experience or project counts be specified? Consider industry benchmarks (e.g., 10+ years for Project Manager, 5+ years for discipline engineers, 3+ comparable projects). *(Lensing Item B-009: SourcePath Guidance.md Sections 2.1, 2.2)*

**Trade-off:** Including more members demonstrates depth, but increases page count and dilutes focus. Prioritize roles that:
1. Align with RFP Section 7 scope requirements
2. Have high visibility to the Owner during project delivery
3. Contribute to evaluation criteria (design quality, construction methodology, commissioning)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from typical Design-Build team structure and RFP Section 7 scope analysis

### 3.2 Resume Length vs. Depth
**Consideration:** How to balance the 2-page limit with the need to provide sufficient detail?

**Trade-offs:**
- **Option A (Detailed single project focus):** Deep dive into 1-2 highly relevant projects with full details
  - **Pro:** Shows depth of relevant experience; easier for evaluators to assess fit
  - **Con:** May not convey breadth of experience
- **Option B (Broad project list):** List many projects with brief descriptions
  - **Pro:** Shows breadth and versatility
  - **Con:** Harder for evaluators to assess depth of involvement and relevance
- **Option C (Hybrid):** Highlight 2-3 key relevant projects in detail, summarize others in bullet form
  - **Pro:** Balances depth and breadth
  - **Con:** Requires careful layout to fit within 2 pages

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** Use Option C (hybrid approach), prioritizing comparable projects (municipal fire halls, public works facilities, Design-Build delivery).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from proposal presentation best practices and 2-page constraint (RFP Section 7.1.7)

### 3.3 Team Stability and Continuity
**Consideration:** How to address team member availability and potential changes?

**Factors to consider:**
- Team members may have other commitments or projects
- Project duration spans multiple years (design + construction + commissioning + warranty)
- Evaluators assess risk of key personnel changes mid-project

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Provide explicit availability statements (e.g., "Available for full project duration from contract award through substantial performance and warranty period")
- If a key member has partial availability, explain the transition plan or backup
- Align availability with the detailed project schedule (DEL-08-01) milestones

**Execution Capacity for Partial Availability:** The guidance mentions "explain the transition plan or backup" for partial availability but provides no structure for what that explanation should contain. Consider requiring: (a) named backup personnel with qualifications, (b) transition timeline, (c) knowledge transfer plan, (d) Owner notification commitment. *(Lensing Item C-006: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 3.3)*

**Availability Scope Clarification:** **Note:** Section 3.3 references "from award through substantial performance" while Section 5.3 example states "from contract award through substantial performance and warranty period." These are different scopes. **Standardize** availability scope to include warranty period for consistency. *(Lensing Item X-005: Conflict — SourcePath Guidance.md Section 3.3; Section 5.3)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from project risk assessment considerations and acceptance criteria ("availability")

### 3.4 Aligning with Other Deliverables
**Consideration:** How to ensure consistency with DEL-07-01 (Firm Experience) and DEL-07-03 (Appendix I Subtrade List)?

**Consistency checks:**
- Projects cited in firm experience (DEL-07-01) should appear in individual resumes (DEL-07-02) where relevant
- All key members in DEL-07-02 must appear in Appendix I (DEL-07-03)
- Roles and responsibilities must align across all three deliverables
- Comparable project references should be consistent (same project names, dates, scope descriptions)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from integrated proposal verification requirements; Decomposition Section 7 (PKG-03 deliverable relationships)

### 3.5 Addressing Project Scope Specifics
**Consideration:** How to demonstrate understanding of the unique aspects of this project?

**Unique project characteristics (from RFP and Addenda):**
- Combined Fire Hall + Public Works facility (dual-function building)
- Municipal owner (Town of Penhold)
- Design-Build delivery
- Site constraints (12-acre developable area, flood fringe exclusion, wetlands)
- Technical requirements (fire apparatus exhaust, backup generator, bunker gear ventilation, solar-ready roof)

**Strategy:** Highlight experience with:
- Multi-department or combined-use facilities
- Fire halls (apparatus bays, bunker gear rooms, EMS storage, SCBA rooms)
- Public works operations facilities (workshop bays, vehicle storage, wash bays, salt/sand storage)
- Municipal clients and procurement processes
- Site due diligence (geotechnical, environmental, grading)

**Source:** Decomposition Sections 1, 4 (scope focus and addenda integration); RFP Appendix A (OSR), Appendix B (Functional Program); Addendum 03 clarifications

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 Local vs. Non-Local Team Members
**Trade-off:** Prioritize Alberta-based team members vs. include specialists from outside Alberta?

**Local team advantages:**
- Familiarity with Alberta Building Code, APEGA/AAA requirements, municipal processes
- Reduced travel/accommodation costs
- Easier site access and availability
- May be viewed favorably by municipal owner (local economic impact)

**Non-local team advantages:**
- Access to specialized expertise (e.g., fire hall design specialist)
- Potentially stronger comparable project portfolio

**Consideration:** If including non-local members, address how their experience translates to Alberta context and how site presence will be managed.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from municipal procurement considerations and project logistics

### 4.2 Experience Depth vs. Recency
**Trade-off:** Highlight older projects with direct comparability vs. recent projects with less direct relevance?

**Factors:**
- Recent projects (last 5 years) may be more relevant to current codes, technologies, and practices
- Older projects may have stronger comparability (e.g., a 10-year-old fire hall project that's a perfect match)

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** Prioritize comparability over recency, but note any significant technology or code changes that affect applicability.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from evaluation focus on "relevant experience" (RFP Section 7.1.7)

### 4.3 Individual Credentials vs. Team Depth
**Trade-off:** Focus on a few star performers vs. show depth across the full team?

**Star performer approach:**
- Highlight 1-2 highly credentialed leads (e.g., Lead Architect with multiple award-winning fire halls)
- Risk: May suggest over-reliance on individuals; gaps in supporting team

**Depth approach:**
- Show strong credentials across all key roles
- Risk: May dilute focus; harder to differentiate if all resumes are similarly strong

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** Balance both — ensure leads have exceptional credentials, but also show competent supporting team to demonstrate delivery capacity.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from Design-Build team assessment considerations

**Example project reference:**
"ABC Fire Hall, City of XYZ (2020-2022) — Project Manager for Design-Build delivery of 15,000 sq ft fire hall with 4 apparatus bays, bunker gear facilities, and training rooms. Delivered on schedule and 3% under budget. Owner reference available."

**Historical Proof Substantiation:** The example includes "Owner reference available" to suggest references can support historical proof. **Guidance:** Include reference availability notation for substantiated claims. Consider when/whether to include actual references vs. "available upon request" notation. *(Lensing Item X-009: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 5.1)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — example illustrative only; not from accessible references

### 5.2 Example Key Role: Lead Architect
**Role definition:** Architectural design leadership, OSR interpretation, functional program compliance, permitting coordination.

**Key experience to highlight:**
- Fire hall and/or public works facility design experience
- Alberta projects (familiarity with ABC, AAA, municipal permitting)
- Professional registration (P.Arch or equivalent)
- Design-Build project experience (integrated design approach)

**Example project reference:**
"DEF Public Works Operations Centre, Town of GHI (2019-2021) — Lead Architect for 20,000 sq ft workshop and vehicle storage facility. Designed for durability and low maintenance; incorporated wash bay, fuel storage, and salt shed. Achieved LEED Silver."

**Substantiated Track Record:** The examples (ABC Fire Hall, DEF Public Works Operations Centre) are illustrative placeholders. **TBD** — Define minimum number of substantiating projects per resume (e.g., 2-3 detailed comparable projects minimum, plus summary list of additional relevant experience). *(Lensing Item E-005: SourcePath Guidance.md Sections 5.1, 5.2)*

**Judgment Demonstration:** Beyond factual credentials, consider including narrative on how the team member's judgment or problem-solving approach contributed to project outcomes — particularly relevant for Design-Build trade-off decisions. *(Lensing Item B-011: SourcePath Guidance.md Sections 2.1-2.5)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — example illustrative only; not from accessible references

### 5.3 Example Availability Statement
"[Name] is fully available for the duration of the Penhold Public Services Building project, from contract award through substantial performance and warranty period. Committed to regular site presence during construction (minimum bi-weekly) and full availability for Owner meetings and design reviews."

**Availability Scope Note:** This example uses "from contract award through substantial performance and warranty period" which is the recommended standardized scope (per conflict resolution for X-005). Ensure all availability statements use this consistent scope.
