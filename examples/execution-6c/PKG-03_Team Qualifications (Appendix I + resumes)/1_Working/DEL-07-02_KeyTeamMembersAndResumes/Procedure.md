---

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Identify Key Roles
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager + Technical Leads

**Action:**
1. Review RFP Section 7 (scope of work) to identify required functional areas:
   - Design methodology (7.1) → architectural, engineering disciplines
   - Construction methodology (7.2) → construction management, site supervision
   - Commissioning (7.3.6) → commissioning coordination
   - Project administration → project management
2. Review Specification.md Section 2.2 (Key Roles Requirements) for typical Design-Build roles
3. Determine which roles are "key" based on:
   - Direct Owner interface during project delivery
   - Regulatory responsibility (professional seals for permits)
   - Critical delivery functions (schedule, budget, quality)
   - Specialized scope relevance (fire hall systems, public works operations)
4. Document finalized list of key roles (e.g., Project Manager, Lead Architect, Structural Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Civil Engineer, Construction Manager, Site Superintendent, Commissioning Coordinator)

**Output:** List of key roles with brief role descriptions

**Verification:** Roles cover all major scope areas in RFP Section 7; no obvious gaps

**Source:** Specification.md Section 2.2; Guidance.md Section 3.1

---

### Step 2: Assign Personnel to Key Roles
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager + HR/Team Admin + Technical Leads

**Action:**
1. Identify personnel from Design-Builder firm and/or key consultant firms to fill each key role
2. Verify personnel availability for project duration (coordinate with HR/Team Admin)
3. Confirm professional credentials and registrations (P.Eng, P.Arch, etc.) are current and in good standing
   - **Verification Method:** Check APEGA member directory for engineers; check AAA registry for architects. Document verification date and source. *(Lensing Item D-003: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Step 2)*
4. Verify indispensable performance qualifications — ensure personnel with regulatory signing authority (e.g., engineer of record) have valid, current registration in good standing. *(Lensing Item C-005: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Step 2)*
5. Confirm mobilization readiness — verify that identified personnel are actually mobilizable (not overcommitted, contractually available, willing to commit). *(Lensing Item X-003: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Step 2)*
6. Document personnel assignments: Role → Name → Company → Professional Designation

**Output:** Key personnel roster (table format)

**Verification:**
- All key roles are filled
- Professional credentials align with roles (e.g., Structural Engineer has P.Eng designation)
- Availability confirmed for project schedule alignment
- Credential verification documented (date, source, verifier)
- Mobilization readiness confirmed

**Source:** Specification.md Section 2.4, 2.5; Guidance.md Section 2.4

---

### Step 3: Gather Resume Content
**Responsible:** HR/Team Admin (coordinator) + Individual Personnel (content providers)

**Action:**
1. Request current resume or CV from each key member
2. Request list of comparable projects (municipal facilities, fire halls, public works, Design-Build projects) with details:
   - Project name and location
   - Client/owner
   - Role and responsibilities
   - Project scope (size, budget, complexity)
   - Delivery outcomes (schedule, budget, quality, client satisfaction)
   - Dates (year or date range)
3. Request education and certifications information
4. Request confirmation of availability for Penhold project duration

**Output:** Raw resume content for each key member

**Verification:** Content received from all key members; comparable projects identified

**Source:** Specification.md Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.5

---

### Step 4: Tailor Resumes to Project Scope
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager (editor) + Individual Personnel (reviewers)

**Action:**
1. Review Guidance.md Section 3.2 (Resume Length vs. Depth trade-offs)
2. For each key member, tailor resume to 2-page maximum:
   - **Page 1:** Professional summary, role on Penhold project, key credentials, education
   - **Page 1-2:** Relevant project experience (prioritize comparable projects per Guidance.md Section 2.1)
     - Use hybrid approach: 2-3 key projects in detail, others summarized
     - Emphasize municipal facilities, fire halls, public works, Design-Build delivery
   - **Page 2:** Additional experience (if space permits), certifications, availability statement
3. Ensure consistent format across all resumes (font, layout, section headings)
4. Highlight "relevant experience" explicitly (per RFP Section 7.1.7 requirement)
5. Include availability statement for each key member (per acceptance criteria)

**Output:** Draft resumes (2 pages each, PDF or editable format)

**Verification:**
- Maximum 2 pages per resume (page count check)
- Relevant experience highlighted
- Consistent format across all resumes
- Availability statement included

**Source:** Specification.md Sections 2.1, 2.6; Guidance.md Sections 2.1, 3.2, 3.3

---

### Step 5: Assemble Key Personnel List
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. Create a summary table of key personnel:
   - Columns: Name | Role on Project | Discipline | Professional Designation | Years of Experience | Key Comparable Projects (brief)
   - **Column Alignment Note:** Ensure columns match Datasheet Section 4.2 Information Architecture. Both should include Professional Designation column. *(Lensing Item F-010: Normalization — SourcePath Procedure.md Step 5; Datasheet.md Section 4.2)*
   - **Years of Experience Definition:** Use consistent measurement definition (total career years? relevant discipline years? years in specific role?) per Datasheet Section 2.6. *(Lensing Item B-004: Normalization)*
2. Ensure table is concise and readable (may be 1-2 pages depending on team size)
3. Order personnel logically (e.g., by role hierarchy: Project Manager first, then design leads, then construction leads)

**Output:** Key personnel list (table format)

**Verification:** All key members from Step 2 roster are included; information is accurate and consistent with individual resumes

**Source:** Specification.md Section 5.1; ASSUMPTION — derived from standard proposal presentation practice

---

### Step 6: Cross-Check with Related Deliverables
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. **Cross-check with DEL-07-01 (Firm Experience):**
   - Verify that projects cited in firm experience profile appear in individual resumes where relevant
   - Ensure consistency of project names, dates, scope descriptions
2. **Cross-check with DEL-07-03 (Appendix I Subtrade List):**
   - Verify that all key members in DEL-07-02 appear in Appendix I
   - Ensure role titles and company affiliations are consistent
3. **Cross-check with DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule):**
   - Verify that availability statements align with project schedule phases and resource loading
   - Flag any availability conflicts for resolution

**Output:** Cross-check log documenting consistency verification (or list of discrepancies to resolve)

**Verification:** No unresolved inconsistencies between DEL-07-02 and related deliverables

**Source:** Specification.md Section 4.3 (Dependencies Verification); Guidance.md Section 3.4

---

### Step 7: Quality Assurance Review
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager + QA Reviewer (if designated)

**Action:**
1. **Content completeness check:**
   - All key roles covered (per Specification.md Section 2.1 requirements)
   - All required resume content present (per Specification.md Section 2.1)
   - Availability statements included for all key members
2. **Format verification:**
   - Maximum 2 pages per resume
   - Consistent format across all resumes
   - Professional presentation (readability, layout, no errors)
3. **Experience relevance assessment:**
   - Resumes highlight relevant experience (municipal facilities, fire halls, public works, Design-Build)
   - Comparable projects are credible and substantive
4. **Credentials verification:**
   - Professional designations are accurate and current
   - Credentials align with roles and project requirements
   - **Credential Accuracy Verification:** Verify truthfulness/accuracy of claimed credentials and project references. Consider spot-checking project references against firm records. *(Lensing Item C-010: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Step 7)*
5. **Acceptance criteria check:**
   - "Covers all key roles" — verified
   - "Credentials align with project type and scope" — verified
6. **Compliance assessment (TBD):**
   - **Note:** No formal compliance assessment criterion currently references the RFP scoring rubric descriptors (what constitutes 0-15 points). If RFP Section 8.3 scoring rubric descriptors are obtainable, map verification checkpoints to rubric criteria. *(Lensing Item A-004: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Step 7; Section 4.1)*
7. **Competitiveness assessment (TBD):**
   - Beyond compliance verification, consider: "Is this team qualified enough to win?" Verification checkpoints verify process completion but do not render a competitive qualification verdict. *(Lensing Item X-007: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 4.1)*

**Output:** QA checklist completed; deficiencies noted for correction

**Verification:** All QA checks pass; deliverable meets acceptance criteria per _CONTEXT.md

**Source:** Specification.md Section 4 (Verification); _CONTEXT.md (Acceptance Criteria)

---

### Step 8: Finalize and Package for Proposal
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. Incorporate any corrections from QA review (Step 7)
2. Convert all resumes to final PDF format (if not already in PDF)
3. Assemble DEL-07-02 package:
   - Key personnel list (summary table)
   - Individual resumes (in order, 2 pages each)
4. Label/title the section per RFP structure (e.g., "Section 7.1.7 — Design-Build Key Members")
5. Prepare for integration into master proposal PDF (coordinate with PKG-01 submission assembly)
6. Archive source files and working drafts for record

**Output:** Final DEL-07-02 package (PDF format, ready for proposal integration)

**Verification:** Package is complete, correctly formatted, and ready for inclusion in proposal

**Post-Submission Conformance Audit (TBD):** No post-submission conformance audit or lessons-learned step currently exists. Procedure ends at package assembly. Consider adding a retrospective step after proposal submission to capture lessons learned for future proposals. *(Lensing Item A-005: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Step 8)*

**Source:** Specification.md Section 5.2 (Deliverable Format); Decomposition Section 3 (Constraint C-01: single PDF submission)

---

### Step 8a (Optional): Document Proficiency Gaps
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. Identify any roles where the team has limited comparable experience
2. Document gap mitigation strategies:
   - Training plans
   - Partnership/subcontracting arrangements
   - Additional hires (if planned before project award)
3. If gaps are significant, consider whether to address in proposal narrative

**Output:** Proficiency gap assessment (internal record; may inform proposal narrative)

**Note:** This step is optional but addresses the gap identified in Lensing Item F-006 (SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Steps 1-8): Procedure assumed all roles will be fully qualified; no gap-handling step existed.

**Source:** Lensing enrichment (F-006)

---

### Step 8b (Optional): Iteration/Recalibration Loop
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. If competitive intelligence or proposal strategy evolves, reconsider:
   - Team composition adjustments
   - Resume content emphasis changes
   - Additional comparable project highlights
2. If significant changes warranted, return to Step 4 (Tailor Resumes) or Step 2 (Assign Personnel)

**Output:** Revised drafts (if iteration warranted)

**Note:** This step addresses the gap identified in Lensing Item D-008 (SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Steps 1-8): The original procedure was linear with no mechanism for recalibrating team composition based on competitive intelligence or proposal strategy evolution.

**Source:** Lensing enrichment (D-008)

---

## 6. Notes and Considerations

### 6.1 Dependency Coordination
**Reminder:** Dependencies are tracked externally (mode = NOT_TRACKED). Coordinate with owners of related deliverables:
- **DEL-07-01 owner:** Proposal Manager (firm experience consistency)
- **DEL-07-03 owner:** Proposal Manager + HR/Team Admin (Appendix I consistency)
- **DEL-08-01 owner:** Scheduler / PM (availability alignment)

**Source:** _DEPENDENCIES.md; Decomposition Section 7 (PKG-03 deliverable ownership)

### 6.2 Schedule Considerations
**TBD** — Production schedule for DEL-07-02 depends on:
- Availability of personnel to provide resume content (Step 3)
- Finalization of project team structure (Steps 1-2)
- Coordination with other PKG-03 deliverables (DEL-07-01, DEL-07-03)
- Overall proposal assembly schedule (PKG-01)

Allow sufficient time for:
- Personnel input and review cycles (minimum 1 week for gathering content)
- Tailoring and formatting (2-3 days)
- QA review and corrections (1-2 days)
- Cross-deliverable consistency checks (ongoing during proposal assembly)

**Timeline for Functional Execution:** **TBD** — What is the expected timeline for functional execution of Steps 1-8? The production schedule noted above is suggestive but non-binding. Proposal Manager schedule authority required to finalize. *(Lensing Item A-007: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 6.2)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from typical proposal production timeline considerations

### 6.3 Risk Mitigation
**Risk:** Key personnel unavailable or unresponsive during resume content gathering (Step 3)
**Mitigation:** Start personnel outreach early; escalate through management if needed; have backup personnel identified for critical roles

**Risk:** Inconsistencies discovered late between DEL-07-02 and related deliverables (Step 6)
**Mitigation:** Conduct cross-checks iteratively as drafts develop; maintain regular communication between deliverable owners

**Risk:** Resume content exceeds 2-page limit (Step 4)
**Mitigation:** Use resume tailoring guidance (Guidance.md Section 3.2); prioritize relevance over volume; edit ruthlessly

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from typical proposal production risks

---

## 7. Appendix: Procedure Flowchart

**TBD** — Optional flowchart or process diagram can be added to visualize the 8-step procedure (now 8 main steps + 2 optional steps 8a and 8b).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from procedure documentation best practices

---

## 8. Post-Award Activation Note

**Out of Scope but Noted:** No "activation" step in the procedure addresses the transition from proposal production to project execution — i.e., how the proposed team is activated if the proposal is awarded. This is out of scope for proposal production but should be noted as a gap for post-award planning. *(Lensing Item E-004: SourcePath Procedure.md Section 3 Steps 1-8)*
