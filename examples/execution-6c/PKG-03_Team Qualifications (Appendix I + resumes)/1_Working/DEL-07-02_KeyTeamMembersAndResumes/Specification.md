**Note on REQ-07-02-03:** The term "relevant" is not defined with measurable criteria. **TBD** — Define relevance thresholds (e.g., project type match, minimum scope similarity, recency requirements) to make this requirement testable. *(Lensing Item A-010: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.1 REQ-07-02-03)*

### 2.2 Key Roles Requirements

**TBD** — RFP does not specify exhaustive list of required key roles.

**Role Selection Authority:** **TBD** — No normative authority statement identifies which entity has final say on what constitutes a "key member." Decision authority for role selection defaults to Proposal Manager pending RFP clarification. *(Lensing Item A-002: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.2)*

Roles must cover the project delivery scope defined in RFP Section 7:
- Design methodology (7.1) — implies Lead Architect, discipline engineers
- Construction methodology (7.2) — implies Construction Manager, Site Superintendent
- Commissioning (7.3.6) — implies Commissioning Coordinator (not "or equivalent" — see normalization note below)
- Project administration — implies Project Manager

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — inferred from RFP Section 7 scope of work descriptions

**Typical Design-Build key roles (ASSUMPTION):**
- Design-Builder Project Manager
- Lead Architect (or Architectural Lead)
- Structural Engineer (P.Eng)
- Mechanical Engineer (P.Eng)
- Electrical Engineer (P.Eng)
- Civil Engineer (P.Eng) — site servicing, grading
- Construction Manager
- Site Superintendent
- Commissioning Coordinator *(Normalized: "Commissioning Coordinator" without "or equivalent" qualifier per Lensing Item C-004)*
- Health & Safety Coordinator (if required by jurisdiction)

**Minimum Experience Thresholds:** **TBD** — No minimum experience thresholds (years, project count, project value) defined for any key role. Quantitative sufficiency criteria needed. *(Lensing Items C-002, F-002: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.2)*

### 2.3 Experience Relevance Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Verification Method | Source |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| REQ-07-02-10 | Demonstrate experience on similar projects | Resume content analysis | RFP Section 7.1.7 ("relevant experience") |
| REQ-07-02-11 | Prioritize experience with municipal facilities | Content analysis | ASSUMPTION — derived from project owner type (Town of Penhold) |
| REQ-07-02-12 | Prioritize experience with fire halls and/or public works operations facilities | Content analysis | ASSUMPTION — derived from project scope (combined Fire Hall + Public Works) per RFP Section 7.1 |
| REQ-07-02-13 | Include Design-Build project delivery experience | Content analysis | ASSUMPTION — derived from project delivery method (Design-Build RFP) |

**Note on REQ-07-02-10:** **TBD** — What constitutes "adequate proof" of relevant experience? Is project listing sufficient, or are references/testimonials/contract values needed? Evidentiary threshold undefined. *(Lensing Item B-002: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.3 REQ-07-02-10)*

### 2.4 Credentials and Qualifications Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Verification Method | Source |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| REQ-07-02-20 | Include professional designations where applicable (P.Eng, P.Arch, CET, PMP, etc.) | Resume inspection | ASSUMPTION — derived from professional practice standards in Alberta |
| REQ-07-02-21 | Demonstrate credentials align with project type and scope | Credentials assessment against RFP requirements | _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria |
| REQ-07-02-22 | Include education and certifications relevant to role | Resume content inspection | ASSUMPTION — standard resume practice |

**Note on REQ-07-02-20:** The qualifier "where applicable" is vague. **TBD** — Specify which roles mandate professional designations (e.g., engineers of record must hold P.Eng; architect of record must hold P.Arch per APEGA Act / Architects Act). *(Lensing Item B-008: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.4 REQ-07-02-20)*

**Note on REQ-07-02-21:** The "alignment" requirement is qualitative and not testable without defined criteria. **TBD** — Define measurable alignment criteria. *(Lensing Item E-001: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.4 REQ-07-02-21)*

**Mandatory vs. Optional Credentials:** **TBD** — Are there mandatory credentials (not just "where applicable") that the RFP or Alberta regulations require for specific roles? Distinguish between:
- Mandatory: P.Eng for engineer of record, P.Arch for architect of record (regulatory requirement)
- Recommended: PMP, LEED AP, GOLD Seal (industry best practice)
- Optional: Other certifications as value-add

*(Lensing Item C-001: SourcePath Specification.md Sections 2.4, 3.2)*

**Binding Qualification Evidence:** **TBD** — Does the RFP require binding evidence of qualifications (copies of professional registration certificates, reference letters, or signed declarations)? Or are resume claims alone sufficient? *(Lensing Item F-001: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.1)*

**Credential Uniformity:** The following professional designations are recognized (canonical list for consistent formatting):
- Engineering: P.Eng (APEGA)
- Architecture: P.Arch (AAA)
- Technology: CET, C.E.T.
- Project Management: PMP
- Sustainability: LEED AP (with specialty)
- Construction: GOLD Seal

*(Lensing Item E-003: SourcePath Specification.md Sections 2.4, 3.2)*

### 2.5 Availability Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Verification Method | Source |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|

| REQ-07-02-31 | Align availability with project schedule (DEL-08-01) | Cross-check against detailed project schedule | ASSUMPTION — derived from integrated project delivery requirements |

**Note on REQ-07-02-30:** The term "project duration" is imprecise. **TBD** — Define temporal scope: design phase only? through substantial performance? through warranty period? Align with contract terms and project schedule. *(Lensing Item D-004: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.5 REQ-07-02-30)*

**Note on REQ-07-02-06 (availability statements):** This requirement is sourced from ASSUMPTION (acceptance criteria interpretation), not explicit RFP mandate. Deployment readiness requirement is assumption-based. *(Lensing Item X-004: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2.1 REQ-07-02-06)*

### 2.6 Format and Presentation Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Verification Method | Source |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| REQ-07-02-40 | Present information clearly and professionally | Visual inspection | ASSUMPTION — derived from proposal evaluation context |
| REQ-07-02-41 | Use consistent format across all resumes | Format consistency check | ASSUMPTION — standard proposal practice |
| REQ-07-02-42 | Ensure readability and accessibility of text (font size, layout) | Visual inspection | ASSUMPTION — derived from submission requirements (PDF assembly) |

**Note on REQ-07-02-41:** Consistency is required but no standard template or format specification is provided. **TBD** — Define or develop a standard resume template with specified sections, fonts, and layout to enable measurable consistency verification. *(Lensing Item F-004: SourcePath Specification.md REQ-07-02-41; Procedure.md Step 4)*

## 3. Standards

### 3.1 Applicable Codes and Standards
**TBD** — No specific codes or standards govern resume format for this RFP.

### 3.2 Professional Practice Standards
**ASSUMPTION** — Professional registration requirements apply where personnel hold professional designations (P.Eng, P.Arch):
- APEGA (Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta) — for engineers
- AAA (Alberta Association of Architects) — for architects

**Registration Verification:** These standards are stated as ASSUMPTION. No regulatory verification step confirms registrations are current. Verification method (e.g., APEGA/AAA registry lookup) should be documented in Procedure. *(Lensing Item A-003: SourcePath Specification.md Section 3.2)*

**Firm-Level Regulatory Permits:** **TBD** — Whether personnel must hold specific Alberta regulatory permits (e.g., OQM permit for engineering firms, Certificate of Practice for architectural firms) is not addressed in DEL-07-02. Cross-reference to DEL-07-01 (firm experience) may be needed. *(Lensing Item D-002: SourcePath Specification.md Section 3)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from provincial professional practice requirements in Alberta; not explicitly stated in RFP

### 3.3 Industry Best Practices
**ASSUMPTION** — Standard proposal best practices apply:
- Resumes tailored to project scope
- Emphasis on comparable project experience
- Clear role definitions
- Professional presentation

**Industry Benchmarks:** **TBD** — No benchmark or reference point for credential adequacy is defined (e.g., industry benchmarks for team composition on comparable Design-Build projects). External benchmarks from industry associations or comparable project data may inform sufficiency assessment. *(Lensing Item E-002: SourcePath Specification.md Section 3.3)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from competitive proposal context

### 4.2 Acceptance Criteria Verification
The deliverable meets acceptance criteria when:
1. **All key roles are covered** — verified by role coverage check against RFP Section 7 scope requirements
2. **Credentials align with project type and scope** — verified by experience relevance assessment and credentials inspection

**Performance Adjudication Gap:** **TBD** — No performance metrics or scoring thresholds defined for what constitutes "strong" vs. "adequate" vs. "weak" team qualifications from the evaluator perspective. Internal benchmark for self-assessing deliverable quality before submission is needed. *(Lensing Item A-008: SourcePath Specification.md Section 4.2)*

**Competence Ruling Threshold:** **TBD** — Is there a pass/fail ruling for competence? A minimum qualification standard below which a team member should not be proposed? Or is any qualified professional acceptable? *(Lensing Item X-006: SourcePath Specification.md Section 4.2)*

**Qualification Governance:** **TBD** — No governance structure defined for qualification verification. Who has authority to approve/reject a team member's inclusion based on qualifications? *(Lensing Item X-001: SourcePath Specification.md Section 4)*

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria

### 4.3 Dependencies Verification
**Mode:** NOT_TRACKED — dependencies coordinated externally by humans.

**Dependencies to verify (external coordination):**
- DEL-07-01 (firm experience) and DEL-07-02 (key members) tell consistent story
- DEL-07-03 (Appendix I subtrade list) includes all key members listed in DEL-07-02
- DEL-08-01 (project schedule) reflects resource availability stated in DEL-07-02

**Project Reference Naming Convention:** **TBD** — Project references cited in resumes (DEL-07-02) must use consistent naming with DEL-07-01 firm experience. No naming convention or project reference ID system is currently defined. *(Lensing Item B-007: SourcePath Guidance.md Section 3.4; Specification.md Section 4.3)*

**Team-Level Qualification Assessment:** **TBD** — Current requirements focus on individual members but not team composition assessment. Consider adding a requirement for team-level qualification verification (coverage of all project phases, no critical gaps). *(Lensing Item C-009: SourcePath Specification.md Section 2)*

**Source:** _DEPENDENCIES.md; ASSUMPTION — inferred from integrated proposal logic
