> **Enrichment Note (F-002):** Evaluation Criteria Self-Score verification method was vague ("assess draft against evaluation criteria") without scoring rubric. RFP Section 7.1.6 evaluation approach is TBD. Internal scoring framework added (>=12/15 pass threshold). Update when RFP rubric is accessible.

## Assessment Governance Structure

> **Enrichment Note (D-006):** Specification identifies "Evaluation Criteria Self-Score" verification as Proposal Manager + Leadership responsibility but does not define assessment governance (criteria, disagreement resolution, escalation). This section establishes governance framework. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix D, Lens D:[evaluative, reviewing]]

| Governance Element | Authority | Escalation Path |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Self-Score Criteria** | Internal scoring rubric (>=12/15 pass threshold); update to RFP rubric when accessible | N/A |
| **Scoring Disagreement (PM vs. Leadership)** | Leadership decision prevails; rationale documented | Executive Approver if impasse |
| **Content Accuracy Disputes** | Technical Reviewer decision prevails; source documentation required | Proposal Manager if impasse |
| **Competitive Positioning Disputes** | Executive Approver decision is final | N/A |

## Readiness Synchronization

> **Enrichment Note (C-005, B-007):** Specification flags TBDs explicitly; Guidance provides comprehensive principles/examples assuming inputs available; Procedure assumes all prerequisites ready. This readiness synchronization table establishes unified approach. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix C, Lens C:[evaluative, consistency]; §Matrix B, Lens B:[wisdom, completeness]]

| Readiness Element | Status | Synchronized Approach |
|-------------------|--------|----------------------|
| **RFP Section 7.1.6** | TBD - not accessible | **DEFER**: Requirements R-01.1 through R-01.6 are provisional pending RFP validation |
| **RFP Appendix A (OSR)** | TBD - not accessible | **DEFER**: OSR tailoring guidance applies assumed priorities; validate when accessible |
| **Firm project database** | TBD - not provided | **BLOCK**: Procedure Steps 3-4 cannot execute; obtain data before proceeding |
| **Firm performance data** | TBD - not provided | **BLOCK**: Delivery success narrative cannot be evidence-based; obtain data before proceeding |
| **DEL-07-02/03 coordination** | NOT_TRACKED | **PROCEED**: Establish coordination per Procedure Step 2; synchronize at draft review |
