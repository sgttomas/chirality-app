| **Evaluation Weight** | 15 points (Project Team & Firms category) | Decomposition §15 |

| **Primary Objective** | OBJ-006: Demonstrate strong team & firms | Decomposition §6 |
| **Scope Item** | SOW-016: Provide Design-Build firm experience narrative | Decomposition §9 |

### Content Requirements
| Requirement | Details | Source |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Relevant DB Experience** | Comparable Design-Build municipal facilities | _CONTEXT.md; Decomposition DEL-07-01 |
| **Comparable Facilities** | Fire halls, public works facilities, or integrated emergency/municipal service buildings | **ASSUMPTION** - inferred from project type |
| **Delivery Success Metrics** | Project completion record, budget/schedule performance, owner satisfaction | **ASSUMPTION** - standard DB qualifications |
| **References** | Client references (format and limits per RFP Section 7.1.6/7.1.7 - **location TBD**) | Decomposition DEL-07-01 "(as allowed)" |
| **OSR Alignment** | Tailored to Owner Statement of Requirements (Appendix A - **location TBD**) | _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria |

### Authoritative Standards Justification
| Standard Category | Governing Authority | Verification Status | Source |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Comparable Facilities Definition** | **TBD** - RFP Section 7.1.6 should define acceptable facility types and comparability criteria | Pending RFP access | _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-001 |
| **Delivery Success Metrics Standard** | **TBD** - RFP Section 7.1.6 or Alberta procurement standards should define acceptable evidence thresholds | Pending RFP access | _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-001 |
| **Alberta Public Procurement Standards** | **TBD** - Verify applicability (version, local Penhold bylaws) | **ASSUMPTION** - assumed applicable pending confirmation | _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-002 |

> **Enrichment Note (A-001):** The Datasheet lists ASSUMPTIONs for "comparable facilities" and "delivery success metrics" but does not specify the standards these are grounded in. Once RFP Section 7.1.6 is accessible, update this section with authoritative standard text. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix A, Lens A:[normative, guiding]]

> **Enrichment Note (C-001):** Neither Datasheet nor Specification defines an obligatory reference threshold (how many required? what disqualifies a reference?). Access RFP to establish minimum reference requirement. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix C, Lens C:[normative, necessity]]

## Construction

### Document Structure (Anticipated)
| Section | Purpose | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Firm Overview** | Company profile, years in business, DB delivery model | **ASSUMPTION** - standard qualifications structure |
| **Relevant Experience** | Project list with details: name, owner, scope, value, completion date | **ASSUMPTION** - RFP Section 7.1.6 requirements (**location TBD**) |
| **Comparable Projects** | Subset of projects most similar to Penhold PSB (fire halls, public works, municipal facilities) | _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria |
| **Delivery Success Record** | Performance metrics: on-time delivery, budget adherence, safety record | **ASSUMPTION** - standard DB qualifications |
| **Client References** | Contact information and project context (format per RFP) | Decomposition DEL-07-01 |

### Information Sources Required
| Source | Availability | Priority | Notes |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **RFP Section 7.1.6** | **TBD** - PDF not accessible | **CRITICAL BLOCKER** | Firm experience requirements and format; execution cannot proceed without this |
| **RFP Section 7.1.7** | **TBD** - PDF not accessible | **CRITICAL BLOCKER** | Team member requirements (relevant for coordination with DEL-07-02) |
| **RFP Appendix A (OSR)** | **TBD** - PDF not accessible | **CRITICAL BLOCKER** | Owner Statement of Requirements for tailoring; value orientation depends on this |
| **RFP Appendix I template** | **TBD** - PDF not accessible | **DEFERRABLE** | Subtrade list format (relevant for coordination with DEL-07-03) |
| **Addendum 03** | **TBD** - PDF not accessible | **HIGH** | Scope clarifications affecting team requirements |
| **Firm project database** | **TBD** - not provided in execution folder | **CRITICAL BLOCKER** | Past project data with contract values, completion dates, key personnel, budget/schedule performance |
| **Firm performance data** | **TBD** - not provided in execution folder | **CRITICAL BLOCKER** | Safety records, quality metrics for delivery success narrative |
| **Client reference contacts** | **TBD** - not provided in execution folder | **HIGH** | Current contact information; confirm availability before listing |

> **Enrichment Note (A-005):** Practical execution is blocked without the sources marked as CRITICAL BLOCKER. These must be obtained before Step 1 of the Procedure can be executed substantively. DEFERRABLE sources may be obtained in parallel with initial drafting. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix A, Lens A:[operative, applying]]

## Readiness and Data Gaps

### Execution Readiness Status
| Data Element | Required By | Availability | Impact on Execution |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Project list data** (contract value, completion date, delivery method, key personnel, budget/schedule performance, safety record) | Specification R-01.2, R-01.3 | **TBD** - firm records not provided | Specification assumes this data exists; Datasheet confirms gap. Requirements deferred until data available. |

> **Enrichment Note (B-001):** Creates inconsistency: requirements assume data exists, but data is confirmed missing. Clarify whether requirements should be deferred until data is available, or whether placeholder estimates should be used. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix B, Lens B:[data, necessity]]

### Value Orientation (Pending OSR Access)
| Value Dimension | Relevance to Profile | Status |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Cost Certainty** | Profile should prove firm can deliver within budget predictably | **TBD** - OSR priority unclear |
| **Schedule Certainty** | Profile should prove firm can meet critical deadlines | **TBD** - OSR priority unclear |
| **Quality Excellence** | Profile should prove firm delivers durable, low-maintenance facilities | **TBD** - OSR priority unclear |
| **Capability Breadth** | Profile should prove firm has range of relevant experience | **TBD** - OSR priority unclear |

> **Enrichment Note (A-006):** Guidance explains business intent but does not anchor purposes to evaluated "value" (what does Penhold owner perceive from firm experience profile?). Once OSR is accessible, clarify value orientation and update profile emphasis accordingly. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix A, Lens A:[evaluative, guiding]]
