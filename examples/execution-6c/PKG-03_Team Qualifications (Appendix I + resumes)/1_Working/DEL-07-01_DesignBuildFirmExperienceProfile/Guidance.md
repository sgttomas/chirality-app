# Guidance: DEL-07-01 Design-Build Firm Experience Profile

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists

The Design-Build Firm Experience Profile serves multiple critical functions in the competitive RFP response:

1. **Establishes Credibility:** Demonstrates that the firm has successfully delivered similar projects (municipal fire halls, public works facilities, emergency services buildings) using the Design-Build delivery method, reducing perceived risk for the Town of Penhold.

2. **Supports Evaluation Scoring:** Directly addresses the "Project Team & Firms" evaluation category (15 points out of 100 total), which assesses the firm's relevant experience and delivery track record.

3. **Builds Owner Confidence:** Provides evidence that the firm understands the unique challenges of integrated Fire Hall + Public Works facilities, municipal client expectations, and Alberta regulatory/construction context.

4. **Differentiates from Competitors:** Allows the firm to showcase competitive advantages through selection and presentation of comparable projects, delivery success metrics, and client satisfaction evidence.

5. **Aligns with Owner Priorities:** Tailoring the experience narrative to the Owner Statement of Requirements (OSR - Appendix A) demonstrates that the firm has read, understood, and can deliver on the owner's specific needs and values.

### Required Knowledge Outcome

> **Enrichment Note (B-003):** Guidance Purpose answers "why" but not "what knowledge does evaluator need?" This section articulates the explicit cognitive outcome. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix B, Lens B:[information, necessity]]

**After reading DEL-07-01, the evaluator SHALL understand:**
- The firm has relevant, verifiable experience delivering Design-Build municipal facilities comparable to Penhold PSB
- The firm has a demonstrable track record of delivery success (on-time, on-budget, quality outcomes)
- The firm's proposed team has the capability and experience to manage integrated fire/public works Design-Build delivery
- The firm understands and can address the Owner's specific priorities as stated in the OSR

### Credibility Evidence Definition

> **Enrichment Note (D-001):** Guidance Purpose §1 "Establishes Credibility" but does not define "successfully delivered" in credibility evidence terms. This definition establishes explicit credibility criteria. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix D, Lens D:[normative, guiding]]

**"Successful delivery" requires evidence of:**
- **On-time completion:** Certificate of Substantial Completion issued on or before contracted milestone (or documented owner-approved extension)
- **On-budget completion:** Final cost within 5% of original contract value (or documented owner-approved change orders)
- **Quality outcomes:** Zero or minimal deficiencies at substantial completion; Certificate of Occupancy issued without re-inspection
- **Client satisfaction:** Reference available who can confirm positive project experience

## Principles

### Underlying Engineering and Business Rationale

#### Principle 1: Relevance Over Volume
**Rationale:** Evaluators have limited time and many proposals to review. Highlighting 3-5 highly comparable projects is more effective than listing 20 marginally relevant projects. Comparability factors include:
- Facility type (fire halls, public works, emergency services, or integrated municipal facilities)
- Project scale (similar building size and budget)
- Delivery method (Design-Build)
- Client type (municipal government)
- Complexity (integrated program, site constraints, operational requirements)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - proposal evaluation best practices; Decomposition §15 evaluation weight (15 points - significant but not dominant, suggesting quality over quantity)

#### Principle 2: Evidence-Based Claims
**Rationale:** Qualifications documents must be defensible. Every claim about delivery success, project outcomes, or firm capabilities should be supported by:
- Verifiable project data (dates, budgets, contract values)
- Client references who can confirm performance
- Objective metrics (schedule variance, budget variance, safety record, quality ratings)

Unsubstantiated claims risk disqualification or low scoring if evaluators cannot verify the information.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - professional proposal standards; Decomposition §3 compliance guardrails (proper execution required)

#### Principle 3: OSR Alignment (Owner-Centric Narrative)
**Rationale:** The Owner Statement of Requirements (OSR - Appendix A) defines what the Town of Penhold values most in this project. A generic firm experience narrative will score lower than one that explicitly connects past project experience to OSR priorities. Common OSR themes for municipal facilities include:
- Durability and low maintenance
- Operational efficiency
- Community safety
- Budget predictability
- Schedule certainty
- Local/regional delivery experience

**Tailoring strategy:** Review OSR priorities (**location TBD** - RFP Appendix A not accessible) and for each comparable project, explain how the firm's experience addresses those priorities.

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria "tailored to OSR"; **ASSUMPTION** - RFP evaluation intent

#### Principle 4: Integrated Team Coherence
**Rationale:** The firm experience profile (DEL-07-01), key team member resumes (DEL-07-02), and subtrade list (DEL-07-03) must tell a coherent story. Evaluators will check:
- Do the firm's past projects align with the expertise of the proposed key personnel?
- Do the subconsultants/subtrades have the capabilities needed for the firm's claimed experience areas?
- Is there evidence that this team (or similar teams) has worked together successfully?

**Cross-deliverable strategy:** When drafting firm experience, anticipate questions like "Who on the proposed team worked on these projects?" and "Which subconsultants supported this work?"

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - evaluation coherence; Decomposition §7 PKG-03 structure (all three team deliverables in same package)

#### Principle 5: Design-Build Delivery Model Emphasis
**Rationale:** Design-Build is a distinct delivery method that requires different capabilities than Design-Bid-Build. The firm must demonstrate:
- Integration of design and construction (not just coordination)
- Single-point accountability
- Value engineering and cost management during design
- Risk ownership and mitigation
- Collaborative owner engagement throughout design and construction

**Narrative strategy:** For each comparable project, emphasize Design-Build-specific successes (e.g., "Delivered 15% under budget through integrated design-construction value engineering" rather than generic "Completed project on budget").

**Source:** Decomposition §1 project delivery method; §5 vocabulary "Design-Builder"; **ASSUMPTION** - Design-Build industry standards

### Design-Build Fundamental Competence Primer

> **Enrichment Note (B-005):** Guidance Principle 5 requires narrative to emphasize Design-Build-specific successes but does not explain what constitutes Design-Build fundamental competence. For authors unfamiliar with Design-Build nuances, this primer provides foundational understanding. [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix B, Lens B:[knowledge, necessity]]

**What differentiates Design-Build from Design-Bid-Build:**

| Competence Area | Design-Build Requirement | Why It Matters for Penhold PSB |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Integrated design-construction** | Design and construction teams work concurrently; design decisions informed by constructability, cost, and schedule | Enables value engineering; reduces RFIs and change orders |
| **Single-point accountability** | One entity (Design-Builder) is responsible for entire project delivery; no finger-pointing between designer and contractor | Owner has single point of contact; disputes resolved internally |
| **Value engineering** | Cost optimization occurs during design phase when changes are inexpensive | Helps achieve budget predictability within Penhold's likely constrained municipal budget |
| **Risk ownership** | Design-Builder owns coordination risk, permitting risk, and integration risk | Reduces owner exposure to claims and disputes |
| **Collaborative engagement** | Design-Builder involves owner in design decisions but manages technical complexity | Owner maintains control over priorities without managing day-to-day coordination |

**Design-Build Competence Baseline (E-001):**

> **Enrichment Note (E-001):** Guidance Principle 5 lists five Design-Build capabilities to emphasize but does not specify foundational competence threshold (all five required? or excellence in three sufficient?). [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix E, Lens E:[normative, necessity]]

**Mandatory baseline (require all):**
- Single-point accountability demonstrated
- At least one successful municipal Design-Build project completed

**Preferred excellence (demonstrate at least 3 of 5):**
- Integration of design and construction
- Value engineering and cost management during design
- Risk ownership and mitigation
- Collaborative owner engagement
- Delivery success (on-time, on-budget, quality)

## Considerations

### Factors to Weigh During Production

#### Consideration 1: Comparable Project Selection
**Trade-off:** Firm's strongest projects vs. most comparable projects.

**Factors to evaluate:**
- **Similarity to Penhold PSB:** Integrated fire hall + public works facility is a specific building type. Pure fire halls or pure public works facilities are less comparable than integrated emergency/municipal service buildings.
- **Geographic relevance:** Alberta projects demonstrate local regulatory knowledge (Alberta Building Code, Alberta Fire Code, municipal approval processes). Projects in other provinces are less valuable unless they demonstrate unique technical capabilities.
- **Recency:** Recent projects (last 5-7 years) demonstrate current capabilities and are more relevant to current codes and construction market conditions.
- **Client satisfaction:** Projects with strong client references are more valuable than projects without verifiable satisfaction.
- **Team continuity:** Projects where proposed key personnel were involved are more valuable (supports team coherence).

**Guidance:** Prioritize 3-5 projects that balance these factors. If the firm has a highly similar project (e.g., integrated fire/public works facility in Alberta, Design-Build, completed in last 5 years) but with lower contract value than Penhold PSB, still include it—similarity often outweighs scale differences.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - proposal strategy best practices

#### Consideration 2: Delivery Success Metrics Presentation
**Trade-off:** Transparency vs. competitive positioning.

**Factors to evaluate:**
- **Accuracy:** Metrics must be defensible. If a project was completed 2% over budget, do not claim "on budget"—explain the variance context (e.g., owner-directed changes).
- **Context:** Raw metrics can be misleading. "Completed 6 months late" looks bad unless context is provided (e.g., "6-month schedule extension due to owner-initiated program expansion; extended schedule approved by owner with no cost impact").
- **Benchmarking:** If possible, compare firm performance to industry norms (e.g., "Safety record: 0.8 TRIR vs. industry average 3.2 TRIR for similar projects").

**Guidance:** Be honest but strategic. Frame metrics with appropriate context and emphasize what the firm controls (design-construction coordination, risk mitigation, proactive communication) rather than external factors (market escalation, permit delays beyond firm control).

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - proposal ethics and competitiveness

#### Consideration 3: Reference Management
**Trade-off:** Strongest relationships vs. RFP reference limits.

**RFP may limit:** Number of references, format (contact info only vs. full letters), timing (may contact references without notice vs. only with permission).

**Factors to evaluate:**
- **Reference quality:** References who can speak to Design-Build delivery success, owner satisfaction, and firm responsiveness are more valuable than generic references.
- **Reference availability:** Confirm references are willing and available before including them (risk: evaluator calls reference who is unavailable or unaware).
- **Reference diversity:** Multiple references from same owner may be less valuable than references from different municipal clients (demonstrates breadth).
- **Project relevance:** Reference projects should be from the comparable project list (don't reference a project not included in the experience narrative).

**Guidance:** Contact potential references early in proposal development; confirm their willingness and availability; brief them on the Penhold PSB project so they can speak to relevant experience.

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-07-01 "references (as allowed)"; **ASSUMPTION** - reference management best practices; RFP §7.1.6 **location TBD**

#### Consideration 4: OSR Tailoring Depth
**Trade-off:** Generic experience narrative vs. highly tailored narrative.

**Risks of generic approach:**
- Lower evaluation score (evaluator cannot easily see alignment to OSR priorities)
- Perception that firm did not read or understand OSR
- Missed opportunity to differentiate from competitors

**Risks of over-tailoring:**
- May require extensive rewriting of firm's standard qualifications material
- Risk of appearing to "over-promise" if tailoring is too specific
- Time/resource constraints in proposal development schedule

**Guidance:** Use a "layered tailoring" approach:
1. **Layer 1 (Firm overview):** Brief OSR reference in firm overview section (e.g., "Our Design-Build approach aligns with the Town of Penhold's OSR priorities: durability, operational efficiency, and community safety").
2. **Layer 2 (Project descriptions):** For each comparable project, add 1-2 sentences connecting project outcomes to OSR priorities (e.g., "Delivered maintenance-friendly design with 25-year roofing system and durable exterior finishes, reducing lifecycle costs—aligning with OSR emphasis on ease of maintenance").
3. **Layer 3 (Delivery success narrative):** Summarize how firm's overall track record supports OSR priorities (e.g., "Our municipal Design-Build portfolio demonstrates consistent delivery of durable, low-maintenance facilities on predictable schedules, supporting owner budget certainty and operational readiness").

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria "tailored to OSR + evaluation criteria"; **ASSUMPTION** - proposal strategy

#### Consideration 5: Integration with PKG-03 Sibling Deliverables
**Interdependency:** DEL-07-01 (firm), DEL-07-02 (people), DEL-07-03 (subtrades) must form a coherent whole.

**Coordination checkpoints:**
- **Firm ↔ People:** If firm highlights experience with fire apparatus exhaust systems, ensure mechanical engineer resume shows relevant expertise.
- **Firm ↔ Subtrades:** If firm highlights electrical/generator experience, ensure Appendix I lists a qualified electrical subtrade/consultant.
- **Timeline:** Develop all three deliverables in parallel or with tight coordination windows to avoid misalignment.

**Guidance:** Establish a "team qualifications matrix" early in proposal development:
| Capability Area | Firm Experience (DEL-07-01) | Key Person (DEL-07-02) | Subtrade/Consultant (DEL-07-03) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Fire Hall Design | Project X (year, owner) | Lead Architect (name) | Fire Protection Eng (company) |
| Public Works Bay Design | Project Y (year, owner) | Structural Eng (name) | Structural Consultant (company) |
| Municipal DB Delivery | Project Z (year, owner) | Project Manager (name) | General Contractor (if applicable) |

Use this matrix to ensure coverage and consistency across all three deliverables.

## Trade-offs

### Competing Concerns Visible from Context

#### Trade-off 1: Page Count vs. Completeness
**Competing concerns:**
- **More detail** = stronger evidence, better evaluation scoring, demonstrates thoroughness
- **Less detail** = respects evaluator time, fits within PDF size limit (15MB total proposal), maintains readability

**Balancing strategy:**
- Use structured tables for project lists (compact format)
- Reserve narrative for most important points (OSR alignment, delivery success differentiators)
- Use appendices for supporting detail if RFP format allows (check RFP §6-9 structure requirements)
- Typical target: **TBD** pages for firm experience section (depends on RFP format and competitor norms)

**Evaluation risk:** Too brief = appears to lack experience; too detailed = evaluator skips content or perceives "padding"

**Source:** Decomposition §3 C-01 (15MB limit), C-02 (order requirements); **ASSUMPTION** - readability vs. completeness

#### Trade-off 2: Local vs. Broader Experience
**Competing concerns:**
- **Local (Alberta) experience** = demonstrates regulatory knowledge, local market conditions, regional construction challenges
- **Broader (national/international) experience** = demonstrates technical sophistication, access to best practices, firm scale/stability

**Balancing strategy:**
- Lead with Alberta municipal projects (most relevant)
- Include 1-2 exceptional non-Alberta projects if they demonstrate unique technical capabilities critical to Penhold PSB (e.g., integrated fire/public works facility in similar climate zone, even if outside Alberta)
- Explain relevance explicitly (don't assume evaluator will infer why a BC or Ontario project matters)

**Evaluation risk:** All non-local projects = perceived as lacking Alberta experience; all local projects = may appear limited in technical depth if competitors show broader portfolios

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - geographic relevance for municipal procurement; Decomposition §1 (Town of Penhold, Alberta)

#### Trade-off 3: Firm Capabilities vs. Proposed Team Capabilities
**Competing concerns:**
- **Firm portfolio** = may include projects delivered by different teams, offices, or past employees
- **Proposed team portfolio** = limited to projects involving currently proposed key personnel

**Balancing strategy:**
- Primary focus: Projects where proposed key personnel were involved (strongest credibility)
- Secondary: Firm projects with similar team structure/capabilities (demonstrates repeatable processes)
- Disclosure: If RFP requires disclosure of key personnel involvement in listed projects, be explicit (check RFP §7.1.6 format requirements - **location TBD**)

**Evaluation risk:** Listing firm projects without team continuity = evaluator questions "Is this the same team that delivered those projects?" = lower confidence = lower score

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - team continuity principle; Decomposition DEL-07-02 interface (key team members)

#### Trade-off 4: Design-Build vs. Design-Bid-Build Experience
**Competing concerns:**
- **Design-Build experience** = directly relevant delivery method, demonstrates integrated design-construction capability
- **Design-Bid-Build experience** = may demonstrate technical excellence in design or construction, but not integration

**Balancing strategy:**
- Prioritize Design-Build projects (delivery method match)
- If firm has limited municipal Design-Build experience, include Design-Bid-Build projects **only if**:
  - Building type is highly comparable (e.g., fire hall designed by firm, even if delivered under different contract method)
  - Firm can articulate how Design-Bid-Build experience translates to Design-Build capability (e.g., "Designed 3 fire halls under Design-Bid-Build; now leverage that technical expertise in Design-Build delivery model")
- Do not overstate Design-Bid-Build relevance—evaluators understand the difference

**Evaluation risk:** Heavy reliance on Design-Bid-Build projects = perceived as lacking Design-Build delivery experience = lower score

**Source:** Decomposition §1 "Design-Build Services"; **ASSUMPTION** - delivery method relevance

## Examples

### Example 1: Comparable Project Description (Strong)

**Project Name:** Red Deer County Emergency Services Centre
**Owner:** Red Deer County, Alberta
**Completion Date:** June 2022
**Contract Value:** $8.5M
**Delivery Method:** Design-Build

**Scope:** 12,000 sq ft integrated fire hall and public works facility including 4-bay apparatus floor with vehicle exhaust systems, firefighter accommodation (8 bunks), training room doubling as Incident Command Post, administrative offices, public works storage and maintenance bays, and site development with vehicle circulation and equipment storage yard.

**Relevance to Penhold PSB:** This project demonstrates our firm's experience delivering the same integrated program type (fire + public works) for a similar Alberta municipal client. Key alignments:
- **Operational integration:** Designed shared facility systems (HVAC, electrical, site access) to support dual fire/public works operations while maintaining functional separation per Alberta Fire Code.
- **Durability and maintenance:** Specified durable finishes (masonry exterior, epoxy floors, stainless steel fixtures) and accessible mechanical systems to minimize lifecycle costs—aligning with OSR priority for ease of maintenance (**ASSUMPTION** - OSR priority).
- **Schedule certainty:** Delivered 3 weeks ahead of schedule through integrated design-construction coordination, enabling owner to commence operations before winter season.

**Client Reference:** [Name, Title, Red Deer County, Phone, Email] - available to discuss project delivery and satisfaction.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - example project structure; demonstrates OSR tailoring (Layer 2 approach)

---

### Example 2: Delivery Success Metric Presentation (Context-Aware)

**Budget Performance:**
- **Outcome:** Completed 2.5% under original contract value ($8.5M contract; final cost $8.29M)
- **Context:** Achieved savings through value engineering during design phase (alternative roofing system with equivalent performance and lower cost) and proactive procurement of long-lead equipment (generator, fire apparatus exhaust system) to avoid market escalation.
- **Owner benefit:** Savings allowed owner to allocate additional budget to site landscaping enhancements.

**Schedule Performance:**
- **Outcome:** Substantial completion 3 weeks ahead of contracted milestone
- **Context:** Integrated design-construction team identified critical path items early (permitting, structural steel procurement) and front-loaded design completion for these elements, enabling early procurement and construction start.
- **Owner benefit:** Early occupancy allowed fire department to commence operations before winter, meeting operational readiness goal.

**Quality and Safety:**
- **Outcome:** Zero deficiencies at substantial completion; Certificate of Occupancy issued on first inspection; zero lost-time incidents (0.0 TRIR)
- **Context:** Implemented design-phase constructability reviews and on-site quality checkpoints at each construction milestone.
- **Owner benefit:** Immediate operational readiness with no post-occupancy rework.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - example metrics with context; demonstrates "framing with context" principle

---

### Example 3: OSR Tailoring (Layer 3 - Delivery Success Narrative)

**Firm Track Record Aligned to OSR Priorities** (**ASSUMPTION** - OSR priorities from typical municipal values)

The Town of Penhold's Owner Statement of Requirements emphasizes **durability, ease of maintenance, operational efficiency, and budget predictability**. Our Design-Build portfolio demonstrates consistent delivery of these priorities across 8 municipal facilities in Alberta over the past 10 years:

- **Durability:** 100% of our municipal projects specified minimum 25-year roofing systems, masonry or metal panel exterior cladding (no EIFS or stucco), and commercial-grade interior finishes in high-traffic areas. Post-occupancy evaluations at 5+ years show minimal exterior maintenance requirements and high owner satisfaction with material performance.

- **Ease of Maintenance:** We design for maintainability by specifying accessible mechanical systems (rooftop equipment vs. buried equipment), color-coded utility systems, and owner-maintainable finishes. We also provide comprehensive O&M manuals and hands-on training for owner facilities staff—supporting long-term operational self-sufficiency.

- **Operational Efficiency:** Our integrated fire/public works experience includes designing efficient circulation (apparatus response vs. public works vehicle movement), shared facility systems where appropriate (reducing redundant equipment), and functional layouts that minimize staff movement and maximize operational readiness.

- **Budget Predictability:** Our municipal Design-Build projects have averaged 1.2% under budget (range: 2.5% under to 0.5% over), with variances typically due to owner-directed changes. We achieve predictability through comprehensive design-phase cost estimating, value engineering, and proactive risk management (detailed in DEL-09-01 Risk Register).

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - OSR tailoring example (Layer 3 approach); demonstrates how to summarize firm track record against OSR themes

---

### Merit Proof Rationale

> **Enrichment Note (E-003):** Guidance Purpose §Differentiates from Competitors explains "allows firm to showcase advantages" but does not explain merit proof mechanism: is merit objective (firm objectively has best track record) or perceived (framing affects perception)? [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix E, Lens E:[evaluative, necessity]]

**Merit is both objective AND framing-dependent:**

**Objective merit factors:**
- Verifiable project data (dates, budgets, outcomes) that evaluators can validate
- Client references who can independently confirm claims
- Certifications, licenses, and industry recognition

**Framing-dependent merit factors:**
- How comparable projects are selected and presented (relevance emphasis)
- How variances are contextualized (transparency with explanation vs. hiding weaknesses)
- How OSR alignment is articulated (explicit connection vs. leaving evaluator to infer)
- How Design-Build competence is demonstrated (narrative strength)

**Most effective merit proof approaches:**
1. **Lead with strongest comparable project:** First impression establishes credibility baseline
2. **Quantify success:** "2.5% under budget" is more compelling than "on budget"
3. **Connect to OSR explicitly:** "This project demonstrates our commitment to durability, a key OSR priority" vs. "This project used durable materials"
4. **Provide context for any weaknesses:** "6-month extension due to owner-directed scope increase" vs. omitting the project

## Value Orientation Clarification (Pending OSR)

> **Enrichment Note (A-006):** Guidance explains business intent but not evaluated value orientation (what does the owner value most?). [Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md §Matrix A, Lens A:[evaluative, guiding]]

**Pending OSR access, value orientation is ASSUMED as follows:**
| Value Dimension | Assumed Priority | Profile Emphasis Strategy |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Cost certainty** | HIGH (typical municipal priority) | Emphasize budget performance metrics; highlight value engineering |
| **Schedule certainty** | HIGH (operational readiness deadline) | Emphasize on-time delivery record; highlight risk mitigation |
| **Quality/durability** | MEDIUM-HIGH (long-term facility) | Emphasize low-maintenance design; highlight post-occupancy performance |
| **Capability breadth** | MEDIUM (specialized facility type) | Emphasize integrated fire/public works experience specifically |

**When OSR is accessible:** Update this table with explicit OSR priorities and adjust profile emphasis accordingly.
