# Guidance: DEL-07-03 Appendix I - Subtrade and Consultant List

## Purpose

**Why this deliverable exists:**

The Appendix I subtrade and consultant list serves multiple critical functions in the Design-Build proposal:

1. **Mandatory compliance:** Satisfies the RFP requirement for a formal team roster (Constraint C-06 per Decomposition §3), without which the proposal may be disqualified.

2. **Team credibility demonstration:** Provides the evaluators with immediate visibility into the breadth and depth of the proposed Design-Build team, contributing to the 15-point "Project Team & Firms" evaluation criterion (Decomposition §15).

3. **Risk transparency:** Demonstrates to the Owner that the proponent has identified and engaged (or planned to engage) all necessary specialists and trades to deliver a complex integrated facility (Fire Hall + Public Works), reducing perceived risk of team gaps or late additions.

4. **Accountability framework:** Establishes a formal record of who is responsible for each scope element, creating accountability and enabling the Owner to assess whether the team structure aligns with the project's technical and operational requirements.

5. **Linkage to other team qualifications:** Acts as the "table of contents" for the broader team qualifications package (PKG-03), with firms and personnel in Appendix I being detailed further in DEL-07-01 (firm experience) and DEL-07-02 (key resumes).

**Navigation Guidance [E-002]:** To enable evaluators to navigate from Appendix I to the detailed narratives in DEL-07-01 and DEL-07-02, the proposal narrative in those deliverables should include cross-references to Appendix I entries. For example, DEL-07-01 firm experience sections should note "See Appendix I, Row [X] for scope assignment" and DEL-07-02 resumes should reference the corresponding Appendix I entry for role context. This linkage mechanism operationalizes the "table of contents" function and improves evaluator navigation. [Per E-002: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Guidance Purpose]

**Source for purpose:** Decomposition §7 (PKG-03 goal: "Present DB firm experience and key people credibly and completely"), §15 (evaluation criteria), and `_CONTEXT.md` (acceptance criteria: "Complete list; no obvious gaps for major scopes").

## Principles

### Principle 1: Completeness Signals Readiness

**Rationale:** In competitive Design-Build procurement, a complete and comprehensive team list signals that the proponent has done the due diligence to understand the full scope and has organized a capable delivery team. Gaps or vague entries raise red flags about preparedness and risk management.

**Application:** The list should cover all major disciplines and trades required for the integrated Fire Hall + Public Works facility, including both common building scopes (architecture, structure, MEP, civil) and specialty scopes specific to the project (fire protection engineering, vehicle exhaust systems, fuel fill stations, emergency generator, overhead door systems, bay sump systems).

**Standard basis:** **ASSUMPTION** - Design-Build procurement best practices (DBIA guidelines emphasize early team assembly and transparency).

---

### Principle 2: Specificity Demonstrates Control

**Rationale:** Generic entries ("TBD," "To be selected") or missing key personnel names suggest that the team is not yet assembled, which increases perceived risk for the Owner. Named individuals and firms demonstrate commitment and enable the evaluators to assess credentials.

**Application:** Each entry should include:
- **Scope of work description** (clear, specific)
- **Company legal name** (not just "General Contractor" or "Mechanical Consultant")
- **Business address** (demonstrates local/regional presence or intentional out-of-region selection)
- **Key personnel names** (individuals responsible for scope delivery)

**Standard basis:** SOW-007 per Decomposition §9 ("scope → company / address / key personnel").

**Contingency Awareness [F-001]:** While specificity through naming individuals demonstrates control and commitment, this principle must be balanced against delivery risk if a named individual becomes unavailable post-award. See **Consideration 2: Named Individuals vs. Firm Capacity** below for guidance on managing this trade-off through contingency planning and qualifier language. [Per F-001: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Guidance Principle 2 / Consideration 2]

---

### Principle 3: Alignment with Technical Scope

**Rationale:** The team composition must reflect the actual project scope as clarified by addenda. A mismatch (e.g., including specialists for removed scope items, or missing specialists for added scope items) signals poor attention to detail or outdated proposal preparation.

**Application:** The team list must:
- **Exclude** specialists for the pickled sand storage building (removed per Addendum 03, Decomposition §4)
- **Include** specialists or trades capable of delivering Addendum 03 technical requirements: 16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust systems, emergency generator (ICP support), fuel fill stations, solar-capable roof design

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 Key Impacts).

---

### Principle 4: Design-Build Integration

**Rationale:** A Design-Build project requires both design consultants (architects, engineers) and construction subtrades (contractors, installers) to be part of the proposal team. The list must demonstrate this integration, showing that design and construction perspectives are both represented.

**Application:** The list should include:
- **Design consultants:** Architecture, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, landscape, fire protection, geotechnical, environmental, specialty consultants (acoustics, commissioning, etc.)
- **Construction subtrades:** General contractor (if not the prime), concrete/foundations, structural steel/framing, masonry, roofing/waterproofing, glazing/curtainwall, interior finishes (drywall, flooring, ceilings, painting), mechanical trades (HVAC, plumbing, fire suppression), electrical trades, site/civil trades (earthwork, paving, utilities, landscaping), specialty installers (overhead doors, vehicle exhaust, generator, fuel systems)

**Source:** Decomposition §1 (Project: "Public Services Building Design-Build Services").

---

### Principle 5: Consistency Across Team Deliverables

**Rationale:** The team qualifications package (PKG-03) includes three deliverables: firm experience (DEL-07-01), key resumes (DEL-07-02), and this subtrade/consultant list (DEL-07-03). Inconsistencies (e.g., a firm listed in Appendix I but not detailed in the firm experience narrative, or a key person named here but missing a resume) undermine credibility.

**Application:** Cross-check all names, roles, and scopes across DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, and DEL-07-03 before final submission. Ensure that:
- Every firm in Appendix I is profiled (at least briefly) in the firm experience narrative or is self-evident (e.g., well-known local firms)
- Every key person named in Appendix I has a resume in DEL-07-02 (or is flagged as a supporting role not requiring a full resume, with rationale)

**Source:** Decomposition §7 (PKG-03 description and scope).

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Local vs. Regional vs. National Firms

**Trade-off:** Municipal clients often value local or regional firms for accessibility, knowledge of local codes/conditions, and community investment. However, specialized scopes (e.g., fire protection engineering for a Fire Hall) may require regional or national expertise.

**Guidance:**
- Prioritize local/regional firms for general scopes where feasible (demonstrates community engagement).
- For specialized scopes, select firms with demonstrated Fire Hall or Public Works experience, even if out-of-region, and justify the selection based on expertise.
- Include business addresses to show geographic distribution.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - municipal procurement evaluation practices often reward local engagement.

---

### Consideration 2: Named Individuals vs. Firm Capacity

**Trade-off:** Listing specific key individuals demonstrates commitment, but also creates accountability if those individuals are not available during project execution. Listing only firms provides flexibility but reduces credibility.

**Guidance:**
- List key individuals for critical roles (lead architect, lead structural engineer, project manager, construction manager, fire protection engineer).
- For supporting roles or large subtrade scopes, listing the firm with a primary contact may be sufficient.
- If a named individual's availability is contingent, note this in the proposal narrative (DEL-07-01 or DEL-07-02) to manage expectations.

**Source:** SOW-007 per Decomposition §9 (requires "key personnel" but does not specify level of detail).

---

### Consideration 3: Subtrade "To Be Determined" (TBD) Entries

**Trade-off:** Some subtrade scopes may not yet be committed at proposal stage (especially if pricing is competitive and subtrade bids are still being gathered). Leaving scopes as "TBD" signals realism but may raise concerns about team readiness.

**Guidance:**
- Minimize TBD entries, especially for major scopes (architecture, structural, MEP, civil, general contractor).
- **Unified TBD Handling Rule [F-003]:** TBD entries are permitted for uncommitted scopes at proposal stage; each TBD must include a qualifier explaining selection/commitment status and timeline (e.g., "TBD - prequalified subtrades under evaluation; selection by [date]" or "TBD - subject to post-award competitive bidding as allowed by RFP contract terms"). See Procedure.md Step 3 for implementation.
- For specialty scopes (e.g., overhead door supplier), TBD may be more acceptable if justified in the pricing narrative (DEL-05-03) as subject to competitive bidding post-award.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - balance between team readiness and procurement realism. TBD handling rule consolidated per [F-003: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md].

---

### Consideration 4: Relationship to Pricing

**Trade-off:** The subtrade list in Appendix I should align with the cost breakdown in Appendix H (Schedule B). Discrepancies (e.g., a scope listed in pricing but missing from Appendix I, or vice versa) create confusion and may trigger evaluator questions.

**Guidance:**
- Cross-check Appendix I against Appendix H Schedule B (DEL-05-02) to ensure scopes are consistently represented.
- If a scope is included in pricing as a lump sum or allowance (e.g., "specialty systems allowance"), ensure Appendix I lists the consultant/subtrade or notes "included in allowance; subtrade TBD post-award."

**Source:** Decomposition §7 (PKG-02 and PKG-03 interaction via evaluation criteria in §15).

---

### Consideration 5: Addenda-Driven Scope Changes

**Trade-off:** Addenda may add, remove, or clarify scopes after initial team assembly begins. Failure to update Appendix I to reflect addenda changes signals poor change control and may result in pricing mismatches.

**Guidance:**
- After each addendum, review Appendix I for impacts:
  - **Addendum 03 example:** Pickled sand building removed → remove any associated consultants/trades (if listed).
  - **Addendum 03 example:** Technical clarifications (16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof) → ensure relevant specialists/trades are listed (e.g., fire apparatus exhaust system supplier, solar design consultant or note in architectural scope, generator supplier/installer).
- Include an addenda acknowledgment process in the compliance checklist (DEL-01-01) to catch these changes.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum Integration Summary).

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Depth vs. Brevity

**Competing concerns:**
- **Depth:** Listing many firms and detailed scopes demonstrates thoroughness and reduces perceived gaps.
- **Brevity:** A long, dense Appendix I may overwhelm evaluators and contribute to file size constraints (15 MB max per Constraint C-01).

**Guidance:**
- Prioritize **completeness** over brevity for major scopes (no gaps).
- Group minor scopes where logical (e.g., "Interior Finishes Subtrade: [Company] - drywall, painting, flooring, ceilings").
- If the list is extensive, consider a summary table in the main proposal body with the full detailed list in Appendix I.

**Recommended priority:** Completeness (no gaps) > brevity, within file size constraints.

**Source:** Constraint C-01 (15 MB max) and `_CONTEXT.md` acceptance criteria ("Complete list; no obvious gaps").

**RFP Constraint Citation [D-001]:** RFP Constraint C-01 (per Decomposition §3) imposes a 15 MB maximum proposal size; Appendix I must fit within this envelope without compromising completeness. When file size pressure arises, consider summary tables in the main proposal body with detailed lists in the appendix, rather than reducing team coverage. [Per D-001: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Guidance Trade-off 1]

---

### Trade-off 2: Commitment vs. Flexibility

**Competing concerns:**
- **Commitment:** Listing committed firms and individuals increases credibility and demonstrates readiness.
- **Flexibility:** Design-Build projects may require team adjustments post-award (value engineering, scope changes, availability issues). Over-committing in the proposal reduces flexibility.

**Guidance:**
- Commit to key roles and major scopes (architecture, engineering, general contracting).
- For supporting roles and minor subtrades, provide qualifiers (e.g., "pending final scope confirmation" or "subject to post-award competitive bidding as allowed by contract").
- Align commitment level with RFP requirements (if the RFP requires binding commitments, state this; if it allows post-award adjustments, note this in the proposal narrative).

**Recommended priority:** Commitment for key roles and major scopes; flexibility for minor scopes with transparent qualifiers.

**Source:** **TBD** - RFP contract terms regarding post-award team changes (not accessible in current deliverable folder).

---

### Trade-off 3: Local Engagement vs. Best-in-Class Expertise

**Competing concerns:**
- **Local engagement:** Municipal clients often value local firms (community investment, familiarity with local codes/conditions, ease of access).
- **Best-in-class expertise:** Specialized scopes (e.g., fire protection engineering for a Fire Hall) may require regional or national experts.

**Guidance:**
- Demonstrate **intentionality** in team selection: if a local firm is chosen, note local presence/experience; if a regional/national firm is chosen, note specialized expertise and project relevance.
- Balance the team: anchor with strong local firms for general scopes (architecture, civil, general contracting if local capacity exists) and bring in specialized expertise where justified.
- Address this balance in the firm experience narrative (DEL-07-01) to pre-empt evaluator concerns.

**Recommended priority:** Local engagement for general scopes where capable firms exist; best-in-class expertise for specialized scopes, with rationale.
