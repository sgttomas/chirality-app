## Requirements

### REQ-01: Mandatory Inclusion in Proposal
- **Requirement:** Appendix I must be included in the submitted proposal PDF.
- **Basis:** RFP §4.3; Constraint C-06 per Decomposition §3
- **Source:** Decomposition §3 (Hard Constraints & Non-Negotiables)
- **Verification:** Visual inspection of final proposal PDF (cross-check in compliance matrix DEL-01-01)
- **Mandatory Interpretation [E-001]:** "Mandatory" for Appendix I means form/presence is required for pass/fail gate; completeness (no obvious gaps) is scored under the 15-point Team Qualifications criterion rather than being a gating requirement. **ASSUMPTION:** This interpretation aligns with Decomposition §3 Constraint C-06 confirming "mandatory item" for presence, while Decomposition §15 confirms scoring for completeness/quality. **TBD:** Confirm with RFP terms whether completeness is also a gating criterion. [Per E-001: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md]
- **Intermediate Verification Checkpoints [A-002]:** In addition to final PDF visual inspection, the following intermediate checkpoints shall be verified during Appendix I assembly:
  - Step 1: Template completeness (all required fields identified)
  - Step 3: Coverage checklist review (all major scopes have corresponding entries)
  - Step 7: Format compliance before quality review (all fields populated, formatting correct)
  [Per A-002: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Specification REQ-01 / Procedure Steps 1-7]

### REQ-02: Complete Major Scope Coverage
- **Requirement:** The list must include all major scopes with no obvious gaps.
- **Basis:** Acceptance criteria in `_CONTEXT.md`
- **Source:** `_CONTEXT.md` (acceptance criteria)
- **Verification:** Review against facility program requirements (Appendix B reference in Decomposition) and technical requirements (Addendum 03 clarifications in Decomposition §4)
- **Major Scope Definition [A-001]:** A "major scope" is defined as any discipline or trade appearing in (a) the integrated Fire Hall + Public Works program (Appendix B), and/or (b) the Addendum 03 technical requirements list. Priority for scope identification follows RFP mandatory requirements first, then Addendum clarifications, then program-inferred disciplines. [Per A-001: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Specification REQ-02]
- **Verification Evidence [C-001]:** Verification shall reference the "Scope Category Checklist" artifact produced in Procedure.md Step 2 as required evidence of discipline-by-discipline review. [Per C-001: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Specification Verification section]
- **Coverage checklist (minimum):**
  - Architectural design
  - Structural engineering
  - Mechanical engineering (HVAC, plumbing, fire suppression)
  - Electrical engineering (power, lighting, fire alarm, communications)
  - Civil engineering (site grading, drainage, utilities)
  - Landscape architecture
  - Fire protection engineering
  - Geotechnical engineering
  - General contracting / construction management
  - Major building subtrades (concrete, steel, masonry, roofing, glazing, interior finishes)
  - Site subtrades (earthwork, paving, utilities, landscaping)
  - Specialty systems - expanded [C-002]:
    - 12a: Overhead Doors (16 ft per Addendum 03)
    - 12b: Fire Apparatus Exhaust Systems
    - 12c: Emergency Generator (ICP support)
    - 12d: Fuel Fill Stations
    - 12e: Bay Sumps
    - 12f: Security/Access Control (if Additional Option 3 included)
  - **Source for coverage checklist:** **ASSUMPTION** based on integrated Fire Hall + Public Works program per Decomposition §1 and Addendum 03 technical requirements per Decomposition §4. Specialty systems expanded per [C-002: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md] to ensure no assignment gaps for Addendum 03 technical requirements.

### REQ-03: Addenda Scope Alignment
- **Requirement:** Team composition must reflect Addendum 03 scope clarifications (e.g., pickled sand building excluded, technical systems included).
- **Basis:** Addendum 03 impacts per Decomposition §4
- **Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 Key Impacts)
- **Verification:** Cross-check team list against updated scope: no pickled sand building specialists; includes specialists for 16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof design

### REQ-03A: Pickled Sand Building Scope Removal [C-003]
- **Requirement:** If the Appendix I list was initially drafted prior to Addendum 03, any consultants or trades originally listed for pickled sand building scope shall be removed from Appendix I post-Addendum 03. If the list was assembled after Addendum 03 (current case), this requirement is N/A but serves as audit confirmation.
- **Basis:** Addendum 03 scope removal (Decomposition §4)
- **Source:** Decomposition §4; Datasheet Conditions and Scope Exclusions
- **Verification:** Confirm no pickled sand building specialists appear in final Appendix I; document assembly timeline relative to Addendum 03 issuance.
- **Note:** This requirement addresses timing ambiguity between Datasheet scope exclusion statement and Specification verification assumption. [Per C-003: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md]

### REQ-04: Company Identification
- **Requirement:** Each listed firm must include legal company name and business address.
- **Basis:** **ASSUMPTION** - standard Appendix I format requirements (location TBD in accessible RFP Appendix I template)
- **Source:** **TBD:** RFP Appendix I template (not accessible in current folder)
- **Verification:** Review table for completeness of company name and address fields

### REQ-05: Key Personnel Identification
- **Requirement:** Each listed firm must identify key personnel responsible for scope delivery.
- **Basis:** SOW-007 requirement per Decomposition §9
- **Source:** Decomposition §9 (SOW-007: "Complete Appendix I list of subtrades / Design-Build team (scope → company / address / key personnel)")
- **Verification:** Review table for completeness of key personnel field

### REQ-06: Design-Build Team Model
- **Requirement:** The list must represent a complete Design-Build team (both design and construction participants).
- **Basis:** Project delivery model per Decomposition §1
- **Source:** Decomposition §1 (Project: "Public Services Building Design-Build Services")
- **Verification:** Confirm presence of both design consultants and construction subtrades

### REQ-07: Contribution to Team Qualifications Score
- **Requirement:** The list must support the broader team qualifications evaluation (15 points).
- **Basis:** Evaluation criteria per Decomposition §15
- **Source:** Decomposition §15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk)
- **Verification:** Quality assessment: Does the list demonstrate a credible, experienced, and comprehensive team?
- **Scoring Criteria [D-002]:** The qualitative assessment for REQ-07 shall apply the following specific criteria during Procedure Step 8 Quality Review:
  1. **Relevance to Facility Type:** Team demonstrates experience with Fire Hall and/or Public Works facilities
  2. **Key Roles Named:** Lead roles (architect, structural engineer, project manager, fire protection engineer) have named individuals rather than "TBD"
  3. **No Critical Discipline Gaps:** All REQ-02 coverage checklist categories have at least one assigned firm
  4. **Addenda Requirements Covered:** All Addendum 03 technical systems (overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations) have assigned specialists
  [Per D-002: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Specification REQ-07 / Procedure Step 8]

### REQ-08: Consistency with Other Team Deliverables
