## Semantic Lensing Notes

**Canonical Discipline List Consolidation [B-002]:** The Major Discipline Categories listed in this Datasheet and the coverage checklist in Specification REQ-02 represent consistent but independently stated assumptions. For cross-deliverable consistency within PKG-03 (DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-07-03), the canonical discipline reference is Specification.md REQ-02 Coverage Checklist. This Datasheet defers to Specification.md for the authoritative discipline list. [Per B-002: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md]
