## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

**Mode:** NOT_TRACKED - Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (per `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).

**Upstream dependencies (recommended coordination):**
- **DEL-05-02 (Appendix H Schedule B Cost Breakdown):** The subtrade list should align with the cost breakdown to ensure consistency between team roster and pricing scopes. **Status:** TBD (coordinated externally by Proposal Manager / Estimator).
- **DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package):** The design concept informs which specialty consultants and trades are required (e.g., solar-capable roof design, overhead door systems, fire apparatus exhaust). **Status:** TBD (coordinated externally by Lead Architect / Designer).
- **RFP Addenda (especially Addendum 03):** Scope clarifications must be integrated before finalizing the team list. **Status:** Addenda 01-03 integrated per Decomposition §4.

**Downstream dependencies (what needs this deliverable):**
- **DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix):** Appendix I completion will be checked as a mandatory compliance item.
- **DEL-01-02 (Final Submission Package):** Appendix I will be embedded in the final proposal PDF.
- **DEL-07-01 (Firm Experience Narrative):** Firms listed in Appendix I should be profiled in the experience narrative.
- **DEL-07-02 (Key Team Members and Resumes):** Personnel named in Appendix I should have resumes in DEL-07-02.

## Steps

### Step 1: Obtain and Review RFP Appendix I Template

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. Extract the Appendix I template from the RFP document (AB-2024-07156-Penhold Public Services Building RFP_2024_004.pdf, location: _Sources/).
2. Review the template to identify required fields (e.g., Scope of Work, Company Name, Address, Key Personnel, and any additional fields such as Role/Responsibility or Relevant Experience).
3. Confirm format (table structure, column headers, any instructions or notes).

**Tool/Format:** PDF viewer or PDF-to-Excel converter if template is in PDF form; Excel if template is provided as a separate file.

**Output:** Blank Appendix I template ready for population.

**Verification:** Template fields match RFP requirements; no mandatory fields are missing. **Checkpoint [A-002]:** Template completeness verified before proceeding.

**TBD:** If RFP Appendix I template cannot be accessed, create a draft table using standard Appendix I format (Scope of Work | Company Name | Address | Key Personnel) and flag for human review.

### Step 1b: Review RFP Contract Terms for Commitment Level Policy [E-003]

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**
1. Review RFP contract terms (if accessible) and Decomposition to determine post-award team change flexibility constraints.
2. Document commitment level policy (e.g., "Key roles committed; subtrades flexible for post-award value engineering" or "All listed firms are binding commitments per RFP §X.X").
3. Communicate policy to team for consistent TBD handling in Step 3.

**Tool/Format:** Policy memo or note in working files.

**Output:** Documented commitment level policy for team list entries.

**Verification:** Commitment policy aligns with RFP terms (if accessible) or flagged as **TBD** for human confirmation.

---

### Step 2: Compile Major Scope Categories

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** Proposal Manager (with input from HR/Team Admin)

**Action:**
1. Review the project scope (Decomposition §1: integrated Fire Hall + Public Works facility) and technical requirements (Decomposition §4: Addendum 03 clarifications).
2. Create a checklist of major scope categories based on:
   - **Building design disciplines:** Architecture, Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering
   - **Site/civil disciplines:** Civil Engineering, Landscape Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering, Environmental Consultant
   - **Specialty consultants:** Fire Protection Engineering, Acoustics, Commissioning Agent, Cost Estimator (if separate)
   - **Construction trades:** General Contractor, Concrete/Foundations, Structural Steel, Masonry, Roofing, Glazing, Interior Finishes, Mechanical Trades, Electrical Trades, Site/Civil Trades
   - **Specialty systems:** Overhead Doors (16 ft per Addendum 03), Fire Apparatus Exhaust (per Addendum 03), Emergency Generator (per Addendum 03), Fuel Fill Stations (per Addendum 03), Bay Sumps (per Addendum 03), Security/Access Control (if Additional Option 3 included), Security Cameras (if Additional Option 4 included)
3. Cross-check this list against:
   - Functional Program (Appendix B) to identify any unique facility requirements (location TBD if not accessible)
   - Concept design (DEL-02-01 draft) to identify design-specific specialty needs (coordinated externally)
   - Cost breakdown (DEL-05-02 draft) to ensure all priced scopes have corresponding team members (coordinated externally)

**Tool/Format:** Scope checklist in Excel or Word table.

**Output:** Comprehensive scope category checklist with no obvious gaps.

**Verification:** Compare checklist against:
- Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 impacts: pickled sand building removed, technical systems included)
- Acceptance criteria (`_CONTEXT.md`: "Complete list; no obvious gaps for major scopes")

---

### Step 3: Identify and List Consultants and Subtrades

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** Proposal Manager identifies consultants and scopes; HR/Team Admin gathers personnel details and firm information.

**Action:**
1. For each scope category in the checklist (Step 2), identify the firm (company name) and key personnel responsible for that scope.
2. Gather firm details:
   - **Legal company name**
   - **Business address** (street address, city, province, postal code)
   - **Key personnel** (name, professional designation if applicable, role/responsibility for this project)
3. Sources for firm/personnel information:
   - Internal team roster (maintained by HR/Team Admin or Proposal Manager)
   - Firm agreements or letters of intent (if firms are committed)
   - Subtrade quotes or bids (for construction scopes)
   - HR records for key personnel details
4. **TBD Handling Rule [F-003]:** For scopes where a firm is not yet committed, TBD entries are permitted for uncommitted scopes at proposal stage. Each TBD must include a qualifier explaining selection/commitment status and timeline (e.g., "TBD - prequalified subtrades under evaluation; selection by [date]" or "TBD - subject to post-award competitive bidding as allowed by RFP contract terms"). Apply commitment level policy from Step 1b.

**Tool/Format:** Spreadsheet or database with columns: Scope of Work | Company Name | Address | Key Personnel | Notes/Status.

**Output:** Populated list of consultants and subtrades with firm and personnel details.

**Verification:** Each major scope category from Step 2 has at least one corresponding entry in the list (no gaps). **Checkpoint [A-002]:** Coverage checklist review confirms all major scopes have corresponding entries.

---

### Step 4: Cross-Check Against Cost Breakdown (DEL-05-02)

**Action:**
1. Obtain the draft cost breakdown (Appendix H Schedule B, DEL-05-02) from the estimator or PKG-02 deliverable folder (coordinated externally).
2. Compare the scopes listed in the cost breakdown with the scopes in the Appendix I list.
3. Identify discrepancies:
   - **Scope in cost breakdown but missing from Appendix I:** Add to Appendix I, or if it's a lump sum/allowance, note in Appendix I as "included in allowance; subtrade TBD post-award."
   - **Scope in Appendix I but missing from cost breakdown:** Verify with estimator; either add to cost breakdown or remove from Appendix I if out of scope.
4. Resolve discrepancies with the estimator and proposal manager.

**Tool/Format:** Side-by-side comparison in Excel or project management tool.

**Output:** Aligned scopes between Appendix I and Appendix H Schedule B.

**Verification:** No unexplained discrepancies between team list and cost breakdown.

**TBD:** If DEL-05-02 is not yet available, proceed with Appendix I based on scope checklist (Step 2) and flag for cross-check once DEL-05-02 is ready.

---

### Step 5: Ensure Addenda Compliance

**Action:**
1. Review Addendum 03 impacts (Decomposition §4):
   - **Pickled sand storage building removed:** Ensure no consultants or trades are listed for this scope.
   - **Technical clarifications included:** Ensure the following are covered in the team list:
     - 16 ft overhead doors (overhead door supplier/installer)
     - Bay sumps (plumbing/civil consultant and installer)
     - Fire apparatus exhaust (fire apparatus exhaust system supplier/installer)
     - Emergency generator supporting ICP (generator supplier/installer, electrical engineer)
     - Fuel fill stations (fuel system supplier/installer, mechanical/civil coordination)
     - Solar-capable roof (architectural/structural design consideration; note in relevant consultant scope or add solar design consultant if applicable)
2. Update the team list to reflect these requirements.
3. Document addenda integration in compliance checklist (DEL-01-01) or proposal narrative.

**Tool/Format:** Addenda impact tracking log; updated Appendix I table.

**Output:** Appendix I reflects Addendum 03 scope clarifications.

**Verification:** No pickled sand building specialists listed; all Addendum 03 technical systems have corresponding consultants/trades.

---

### Step 6: Cross-Check Against Firm Experience (DEL-07-01) and Key Resumes (DEL-07-02)

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** Proposal Manager (cross-reference review); HR/Team Admin (resolve personnel discrepancies)

**Action:**
1. Obtain drafts of DEL-07-01 (Firm Experience Narrative) and DEL-07-02 (Key Team Members and Resumes) from the proposal manager or PKG-03 deliverable folders (coordinated externally).
2. Cross-reference:
   - **Firm names:** Every firm in Appendix I should be mentioned (at least briefly) in DEL-07-01, or be self-evident (e.g., well-known local firms that don't require detailed profiling).
   - **Key personnel names:** Every key person named in Appendix I should have a resume in DEL-07-02, or be flagged as a supporting role not requiring a full resume (with rationale).
   - **Roles/responsibilities:** Roles described in Appendix I should match those in DEL-07-01 and DEL-07-02.
3. Identify inconsistencies (name mismatches, role discrepancies, missing profiles/resumes).
4. **Inconsistency Resolution Decision Rules [X-002]:**
   - **Firm in Appendix I absent from DEL-07-01:** Determine if firm is self-evident (well-known local company) with human sign-off, OR add firm to DEL-07-01 with at minimum a brief profile.
   - **Key personnel in Appendix I lack resumes in DEL-07-02:** Determine if supporting role with qualifier (e.g., "Site Superintendent - resume available upon request"), OR add resume to DEL-07-02.
   - Document all resolution decisions in the cross-reference matrix.
5. Resolve inconsistencies with the proposal manager and HR/Team Admin.

**Tool/Format:** Cross-reference matrix in Excel or project management tool.

**Output:** Consistent names, roles, and firms across DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, and DEL-07-03.

**Verification:** No unexplained inconsistencies; all key personnel in Appendix I have corresponding resumes (or justified exclusions per X-002 decision rules).

**TBD:** If DEL-07-01 or DEL-07-02 are not yet available, proceed with Appendix I and flag for cross-check once other deliverables are ready.

**Source:** [Per X-002: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Procedure Step 6 / Guidance Principle 5]

### Step 7: Format and Finalize Appendix I Table

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** HR/Team Admin (formatting); Proposal Manager (final review)

**Action:**
1. Transfer the compiled list (Steps 3-6) into the RFP Appendix I template (Step 1).
2. Ensure proper formatting:
   - Column alignment and readability
   - Consistent use of company legal names (not abbreviations unless clarified)
   - Complete addresses (no missing city/province/postal code)
   - Named key personnel (no blank fields unless justified as "TBD" with qualifier)
3. Proofread for typos, formatting errors, and completeness.
4. Add any required headers, footers, or notes per RFP template instructions.
5. Save the completed Appendix I in the appropriate format (Excel, PDF, or as specified by RFP).

**Tool/Format:** Excel or PDF; follow RFP template format.

**Output:** Completed, formatted Appendix I ready for inclusion in proposal.

**Verification:** All required fields populated; no formatting errors; consistent with RFP template. **Checkpoint [A-002]:** Format compliance verified before proceeding to quality review.

---

### Step 8: Quality Review and Approval

**Role Assignment [F-002]:** Proposal Manager (quality review and approval)

**Action:**
1. Submit the completed Appendix I to the Proposal Manager for quality review.
2. Proposal Manager reviews against **Specification.md Verification section** [X-001] plus:
   - Acceptance criteria (`_CONTEXT.md`: "Complete list; no obvious gaps for major scopes")
   - Compliance requirements (RFP §4.3, Constraint C-06 per Decomposition §3)
   - Cross-deliverable consistency (DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-05-02)
   - Addenda compliance (Addendum 03 impacts)
   - **REQ-07 Scoring Criteria [D-002]:** Relevance to facility type, key roles named, no critical discipline gaps, addenda requirements covered
3. Proposal Manager provides feedback or approval.
4. Incorporate any revisions and resubmit if necessary.
5. Final approval from Proposal Manager.

**Tool/Format:** Review checklist aligned with Specification.md Verification section; email or project management system for approval workflow.

**Output:** Approved Appendix I ready for integration into final proposal PDF.

**Verification:** Proposal Manager sign-off; no open issues or gaps; Specification verification checklist completed.

**Source:** [Per X-001: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, Specification Verification section / Procedure Step 8]

### Step 9: Integrate into Final Proposal PDF (DEL-01-02)

**Action:**
1. Provide the approved Appendix I to the document assembly team (responsible for DEL-01-02).
2. Ensure Appendix I is inserted in the correct location in the proposal PDF (per RFP required structure: Sections 6, 7, 8, 9; Appendix I follows main sections).
3. Verify that Appendix I appears correctly in the assembled PDF (no truncation, proper pagination).
4. Confirm that the final proposal PDF remains under 15 MB (Constraint C-01 per Decomposition §3).

**Tool/Format:** PDF assembly software (Adobe Acrobat, Bluebeam, etc.).

**Output:** Appendix I integrated into final proposal PDF.

**Verification:** Visual inspection of final PDF; Appendix I present and complete; file size < 15 MB.

---

### Step 10: Update Compliance Matrix (DEL-01-01)

**Action:**
1. Provide confirmation of Appendix I completion to the compliance matrix owner (DEL-01-01).
2. Compliance matrix owner checks off "Appendix I - Subtrade and Consultant List" as complete and notes the proposal page reference.
3. Ensure this is tracked as a mandatory compliance item (Constraint C-06).

**Tool/Format:** Compliance matrix spreadsheet or checklist.

**Output:** DEL-01-01 updated to reflect Appendix I completion.

**Verification:** Compliance matrix entry for Appendix I shows "Complete" with page reference.

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **RFP Appendix I template not accessible** | Proceed with standard format (Scope / Company / Address / Key Personnel) and flag for verification once template is obtained |
| **Consultant/subtrade not yet committed at proposal stage** | List as "TBD" with qualifier (e.g., "prequalified subtrades under evaluation") to signal procurement in progress |
| **Scope gaps discovered late in proposal preparation** | Run scope coverage review early (Step 2) and flag gaps to Proposal Manager for urgent resolution |
| **Inconsistency with other deliverables (DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-05-02)** | Implement cross-check steps (Steps 4 and 6) and resolve discrepancies before final approval (Step 8) |
| **File size constraint (15 MB max)** | Monitor PDF file size during assembly (Step 9); if Appendix I contributes significantly, consider summarizing in main body with detailed list in appendix |
