# Guidance: DEL-08-01 DetailedProjectSchedule

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to:

1. **Demonstrate delivery competency:** The detailed project schedule is a scored evaluation criterion (OBJ-009: "Provide a believable schedule") within the broader Project Delivery Plan evaluation category (10 points per decomposition Section 15).

2. **Establish credibility and realism:** The schedule must show that the Design-Build team understands the scope, sequencing, dependencies, and constraints of delivering an integrated Fire Hall + Public Works facility on a constrained site with geotechnical, wetland, and flood zone considerations.

3. **Support integrated proposal:** The schedule serves as the temporal backbone that connects design methodology (DEL-03-01), construction methodology (DEL-04-01), commissioning approach (DEL-06-01), risk management (DEL-09-01), and pricing (DEL-05-01/02). Inconsistencies between schedule and other deliverables undermine proposal credibility.

4. **Provide baseline for post-award refinement:** While this is a proposal-stage schedule (Level 2/3 detail), it establishes the baseline logic and milestone structure that will be refined into a detailed construction schedule after contract award.

### Schedule Narrative Strategy for Demonstrating Capacity
**Source:** Semantic Lensing E-002 (confirmed delivery capacity)

Schedule narrative should affirmatively demonstrate delivery capacity through:
1. **Experience citation:** "Our team delivered [X] comparable facilities in [duration] months." Reference firm historical data for municipal Design-Build projects in 10,000-15,000 SF range.
2. **Site knowledge:** Reference geotechnical findings, wetland/flood zone considerations, survey post-award constraint in schedule narrative.
3. **Risk awareness:** State buffers in Assumptions (commissioning protected, procurement early, permits buffered). These elements signal confirmed delivery capacity to evaluators.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Transparency Over Optimism
**Rationale:** An overly aggressive schedule signals inexperience or wishful thinking. A credible schedule acknowledges constraints (permitting, procurement, weather, commissioning) and includes appropriate buffers or contingencies. Evaluators can distinguish between "optimistic" and "achievable."

**Application:**
- Document all assumptions explicitly (REQ-SCH-008)
- Include realistic permitting durations (8-10 weeks typical for Alberta municipal building permits, including 2-week contingency buffer - **ASSUMPTION**)
- Account for winter weather constraints on concrete work and exterior finishes (Alberta climate - **ASSUMPTION**)
- Reflect Addendum 03 constraint: survey files available post-award (delays early site work start)

**Duration Acceptance Threshold:** Durations should align within ±20% of historical norms for comparable municipal Design-Build projects. Benchmark against 18-24 month total duration. Peer review criteria: durations justified by historical data or explicit rationale.

**Source:** Decomposition OBJ-008 (transparent risk management), REQ-SCH-002 (believable durations), Semantic Lensing A-001 (prescriptive direction on believability acceptance)

---

### Principle 2: Critical Path as Control Strategy
**Rationale:** The critical path identifies the sequence of activities that, if delayed, will delay project completion. Demonstrating awareness of the critical path and having a float management strategy shows schedule control competency.

**Application:**
- Identify critical path activities explicitly (REQ-SCH-007)
- Likely critical path drivers (ASSUMPTION based on typical Design-Build projects):
  - Permit approval (external dependency; limited control)
  - Long-lead equipment procurement (MEP, overhead doors, fire apparatus exhaust systems)
  - Building enclosure (weather-dependent; gates interior work)
  - Commissioning (sequential system testing; cannot compress without risk)
- Provide narrative explaining critical path and float allocation approach

**Penhold PSB Site-Specific Critical Path Drivers:**
**Source:** Semantic Lensing C-002 (demonstrated operational adequacy)
- **Site survey post-award (3 weeks):** Gates site design; survey files provided post-award per Addendum 03
- **Geotechnical findings:** Impact foundation timeline; soil bearing capacity, groundwater, frost depth considerations
- **Wetland/flood zone:** May require parallel environmental permitting coordination for 8-acre flood fringe area
- **Integrated Fire Hall + Public Works:** Unusual coordination requirements for dual-function facility

**Source:** REQ-SCH-007, Principle derived from PMI PMBOK schedule management (**ASSUMPTION**), Decomposition Section 4 (Addendum 03), Datasheet Limiting Conditions

---

### Principle 3: Integration Across Disciplines
**Rationale:** A municipal facility integrating Fire Hall and Public Works functions involves multiple disciplines (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, civil/site) that must be sequenced logically. Schedule must reflect interdisciplinary coordination.

**Application:**
- Design phase: Architectural leads; structural and MEP follow; civil site works coordinate with building footprint
- Construction phase: Foundation and structure first; MEP rough-in after enclosure; finishes after MEP; commissioning after finishes
- Reflect specialized systems: fire apparatus exhaust (coordinated with mechanical), bay sumps (coordinated with plumbing/civil), overhead doors (long-lead; coordinate with structure and finishes)

**Source:** Decomposition Section 4 (Addendum 03 technical requirements), typical Design-Build sequencing (**ASSUMPTION**)

---

### Principle 4: Risk-Informed Scheduling
**Rationale:** Schedule must account for identified risks (REQ-SCH-011). High-probability risks require schedule buffers, contingency activities, or mitigation strategies.

**Application:**
- Weather risk: Schedule outdoor work (earthwork, concrete, enclosure) during favorable months (May-September typical in Alberta - **ASSUMPTION**); include weather delay buffer
- Procurement risk: Identify long-lead items early; allow contingency for vendor selection and shop drawing reviews
- Permitting risk: Allow buffer for permit review iterations or additional information requests
- Site risk: Geotechnical findings (soil bearing capacity, groundwater, frost depth - **references not accessible; location TBD**) may affect foundation design and schedule

**Source:** REQ-SCH-011 (risk register coordination), decomposition SOW-026 (risk management plan), typical risk management practice (**ASSUMPTION**)

---

### Principle 5: Addenda Compliance
**Rationale:** Addenda clarifications must be reflected in the schedule to demonstrate compliance and avoid disqualification risk.

**Application:**
- **Addendum 03 - Pickled sand storage building removed:** Scope reduction; shorter overall schedule than if building were included
- **Addendum 03 - Survey files post-award:** Constraint on early site work; site survey activities must occur post-award before detailed site design and earthwork can proceed
- **Addendum 03 - Site servicing allowance:** Affects sitework phasing assumptions; tie-ins may be coordinated with municipality post-award

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Proposal-Stage Detail Level
**Trade-off:** Proposal schedules are typically Level 2 or 3 detail (50-150 activities - **ASSUMPTION**), balancing sufficient detail to demonstrate understanding without over-committing to activities that will change during design development.

**Guidance:**
- **Too little detail:** Schedule appears superficial; lacks credibility
- **Too much detail:** Schedule appears rigid; suggests inflexibility or lack of understanding that design will evolve
- **Appropriate detail:** Major phases, key milestones, critical path activities, and interface points are visible; sub-activities are aggregated into logical work packages

**Why Evaluators Prefer Level 2-3 Detail:**
**Source:** Semantic Lensing F-004 (essential credibility basis)
Evaluators prefer Level 2-3 detail (50-150 activities) because this balance demonstrates:
- **Technical competency:** Project understanding evident through appropriate breakdown
- **Flexibility preservation:** Not over-committing to pre-design assumptions
- **Industry alignment:** Level 2-3 is standard for proposal-stage municipal Design-Build projects

Excessively detailed schedules (daily breakdown) signal rigidity. Excessively simple schedules (5-10 milestones) appear superficial.

**Recommendation:** Use CSI MasterFormat divisions as a phasing guide (e.g., "Division 03 - Concrete" as a single activity or small group of activities; not individual pour schedules).

**Source:** Typical practice for Design-Build proposals (**ASSUMPTION**); PMBOK schedule development guidance (**ASSUMPTION**)

---

### Consideration 2: Schedule Software and Format
**Trade-off:** RFP may specify scheduling software (MS Project, Primavera P6) or allow flexibility. If not specified (**location TBD**), choose software that produces professional, readable Gantt charts and supports critical path analysis.

**Guidance:**
- **MS Project:** Widely used; evaluators likely familiar; adequate for proposal-level schedules
- **Primavera P6:** More robust for large projects; may be overkill for proposal but signals capability
- **PDF export:** Ensure Gantt chart is legible when printed/viewed; critical path visually distinct (color coding or bold lines)

**Recommendation:** If RFP does not specify, use MS Project (accessible, familiar) and export high-quality PDF for proposal submission.

**Source:** Typical proposal practice (**ASSUMPTION**); RFP requirements **location TBD**

---

### Consideration 3: Float Allocation and Owner Control
**Trade-off:** Design-Build contracts often include provisions about float ownership (contractor float vs project float). Proposal-stage schedule should not over-commit on float allocation.

**Guidance:**
- **Conservative approach:** Show that critical path activities have minimal float; non-critical activities have reasonable float for normal coordination and minor delays
- **Avoid:** Showing excessive float that suggests schedule padding or lack of urgency
- **Avoid:** Showing zero float on all activities (unrealistic; signals inflexibility)

**Recommendation:** Critical path activities: 0-5 days float; near-critical activities: 5-15 days float; non-critical activities: 15+ days float (typical ranges - **ASSUMPTION**).

**Source:** PMI PMBOK float management principles (**ASSUMPTION**); Design-Build contracting norms (**ASSUMPTION**)

---

### Consideration 4: Procurement and Long-Lead Items
**Trade-off:** Proposal-stage schedule must estimate procurement lead times without vendor quotes. Long-lead items drive construction sequencing.

**Guidance:**
- **Typical long-lead items for this project type (ASSUMPTION):**
  - Overhead doors (16 ft clear height per Addendum 03): 12-16 weeks
  - HVAC equipment (rooftop units, boilers): 10-14 weeks
  - Fire alarm system: 8-12 weeks
  - Fire apparatus exhaust system: 10-14 weeks
  - Electrical switchgear and panels: 10-14 weeks
  - Generator (ICP support required per Addendum 03): 12-16 weeks
- **Procurement phase activities:**
  - Vendor pre-qualification and bidding: 2-4 weeks
  - Shop drawing preparation and review: 2-4 weeks (per item)
  - Fabrication: (lead time above)
  - Shipping: 1-2 weeks (domestic); 4-8 weeks (international - **ASSUMPTION**: mostly domestic suppliers)

**Lead Time Validation:**
**Source:** Semantic Lensing D-003 (proven implementation execution), B-002 (satisfactory reporting)
For proposal-stage, obtain preliminary vendor quotes OR confirm historical firm data for top 3 long-lead items:
1. 16-foot overhead doors
2. Emergency generator (ICP support)
3. Fire apparatus exhaust system

If vendor quotes obtained: use actual lead times and cite in Assumptions.
If not: use Guidance ranges and note in Assumptions: "Lead times estimated per industry benchmarks. Actual lead times confirmed post-award upon vendor bids."

**Recommendation:** Identify top 5-10 long-lead items; document lead time assumptions with source; show procurement activities starting early in design phase (parallel with detailed design).

**Source:** Addendum 03 technical requirements (overhead doors, generator), typical procurement lead times (**ASSUMPTION**)

---

### Consideration 5: Commissioning Duration
**Trade-off:** Commissioning is often underestimated in proposal schedules, leading to schedule risk. Fire and life-safety systems require thorough commissioning.

**Guidance:**
- **Systems requiring commissioning (ASSUMPTION based on facility type):**
  - HVAC (balance, controls, setpoints)
  - Electrical (testing, load verification)
  - Fire alarm (device testing, integration with fire department)
  - Fire suppression (sprinkler system testing, backflow prevention)
  - Fire apparatus exhaust (capture verification, interlock testing)
  - Building automation/controls (sequence verification)
  - Emergency generator (load testing, transfer switch testing)
  - Overhead doors (operation, safety testing)
- **Typical commissioning duration (ASSUMPTION):**
  - Commissioning plan development: 2-3 weeks (during construction)
  - Pre-functional testing: 2-3 weeks (as systems come online)
  - Functional performance testing: 3-4 weeks (sequential system testing)
  - Deficiency correction: 2-3 weeks (overlap with other closeout activities)
  - **Total commissioning window:** 10-12 weeks (some activities parallel; sequential testing drives duration)

**Recommendation:** Allocate 10-12 weeks for commissioning on schedule; coordinate with DEL-06-01 (commissioning narrative) for consistency (REQ-SCH-005).

**Source:** REQ-SCH-005, typical commissioning practice for municipal facilities (**ASSUMPTION**)

---

### Consideration 6: Weather and Seasonality (Alberta Context)
**Trade-off:** Alberta has a limited construction season for exterior work due to winter temperatures. Scheduling outdoor work in winter increases cost (heating, enclosures) and risk (slower productivity, concrete curing challenges).

**Guidance:**
- **Favorable construction months (ASSUMPTION):** May through September (5 months)
- **Challenging months:** October-November (cold but workable with precautions); December-March (winter conditions; limit outdoor work)
- **Critical weather-dependent activities:**
  - Earthwork and site grading
  - Concrete foundation and slab-on-grade
  - Building enclosure (masonry, exterior cladding, roofing)
  - Site paving and landscaping
- **Winter-feasible activities:**
  - Interior framing, drywall, finishes (if building is enclosed and heated)
  - MEP rough-in and trim-out
  - Commissioning (interior systems)

**Recommendation:** Schedule foundation and enclosure completion by October; plan interior work for winter months; resume site works in spring if not completed in fall.

**Source:** Alberta climate context (**ASSUMPTION**); typical construction scheduling practice in cold climates (**ASSUMPTION**)

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Schedule Duration vs Cost
**Tension:** Shorter schedules reduce general conditions costs (site overhead, supervision) but increase risk of overtime, acceleration costs, and quality issues. Longer schedules increase carrying costs but reduce risk.

**Evaluation Impact:** Evaluators assess schedule "believability" (decomposition acceptance criteria), not necessarily shortest duration. An overly short schedule may signal risk.

**Guidance:**
- Benchmark against comparable municipal Design-Build projects (**ASSUMPTION**: 18-24 months from contract award to substantial completion for 10,000-15,000 SF municipal facility)
- Coordinate with estimator (DEL-05-01/02): ensure schedule duration aligns with general conditions pricing and escalation assumptions (REQ-SCH-010)

**Schedule Duration Justification:**
**Source:** Semantic Lensing D-005 (justified benefit delivery)
In critical path narrative, explicitly justify proposed duration versus benchmark (18-24 months). State: "We propose [XX] months because: [Justified benefit]."

Justified benefits may include:
- **Constructability optimization:** Phasing aligned with site constraints
- **Weather optimization:** Enclosure complete before winter
- **Procurement risk mitigation:** Long-lead items ordered early
- **Cost optimization:** Balanced general conditions vs acceleration costs

This demonstrates strategic decision-making, not arbitrary schedule choice.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize credibility over aggressive duration; document trade-off rationale in schedule assumptions with explicit justification.

**Source:** REQ-SCH-002 (believable durations), REQ-SCH-010 (pricing coordination), decomposition OBJ-009

---

### Trade-off 2: Detail Level vs Flexibility
**Tension:** More detailed schedules demonstrate thoroughness but reduce flexibility for design evolution. Less detailed schedules are flexible but may appear superficial.

**Evaluation Impact:** Evaluators expect sufficient detail to assess delivery competency without over-commitment to pre-design assumptions.

**Guidance:**
- **Appropriate detail for proposal stage:** Major phases (design, permitting, procurement, construction, commissioning, closeout); key milestones; critical path activities; interface points
- **Avoid excessive detail:** Individual equipment installations, daily work breakdowns, detailed crew assignments (these are post-award refinements)

**Recommendation:** Level 2/3 schedule (50-150 activities); provide flexibility statement in schedule assumptions acknowledging post-award refinement.

**Source:** Typical proposal practice (**ASSUMPTION**), Principle 1 (transparency)

---

### Trade-off 3: Float Allocation (Owner vs Contractor)
**Tension:** Allocating project float to contractor increases schedule control flexibility; allocating to owner reduces contractor schedule risk but may constrain schedule management.

**Evaluation Impact:** Proposal-stage schedule should not take a strong position on float ownership (contractual issue); show reasonable float exists without over-committing.

**Guidance:**
- Avoid language like "all float is contractor-owned" or "all float is project float" (contractual negotiation topic)
- Show that schedule has reasonable float for coordination and minor delays; demonstrate awareness of critical vs non-critical paths

**Float Allocation Harmonization:**
**Source:** Semantic Lensing B-004 (conflict resolution: float allocation)
**Note:** Procedure allocates schedule buffers (10-20 days contingency) for risk mitigation purposes. This is not a contractual float ownership position.

Schedule Assumptions document must include disclaimer: "Float allocation between Owner and Contractor will be negotiated at award. Proposal-stage buffers represent risk-mitigation allowances, not contractual float claims."

**Recommendation:** In critical path narrative (REQ-SCH-007), note that float management approach will be established during contract negotiation and refined post-award.

### Example 2: Critical Path Narrative (Excerpt)

> **Critical Path Overview**
>
> The project critical path for the Penhold Public Services Building runs through the following key activities:
>
> 1. **Site Survey (post-award):** Per Addendum 03, survey files are provided after contract award. Site survey activities (3 weeks) must precede detailed site design and earthwork, placing this on the critical path.
>
> 2. **Permit Approval:** Building permit approval (estimated 8 weeks from submission) is a critical path activity with limited control. We have allocated a 2-week contingency buffer for potential review iterations.
>
> 3. **Building Enclosure:** Achieving weather-tight enclosure by [Target Date - October recommended] is critical to enabling winter interior work and maintaining overall schedule. This activity is weather-dependent; contingency includes overtime and temporary enclosures if weather delays occur.
>
> 4. **Long-Lead Procurement (Overhead Doors & Generator):** 16 ft overhead doors and emergency generator (ICP support per Addendum 03) have 12-16 week lead times. Procurement activities start in parallel with permitting to ensure delivery by installation dates.
>
> 5. **Commissioning:** Sequential system commissioning (10 weeks) is on the critical path. Compressing commissioning risks operational deficiencies and warranty issues; therefore, this duration is protected.
>
> **Float Management:** Non-critical activities (interior finishes, site landscaping) have 10-15 days of float to accommodate minor coordination delays without impacting substantial completion.
