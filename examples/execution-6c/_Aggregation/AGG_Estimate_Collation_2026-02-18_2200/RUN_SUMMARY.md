## Project-Level Totals

### 1. Total Proposal Production Cost

The sum of professional hours to produce all 21 proposal deliverables.

| Package | Package Name | Production Cost (CAD) | Production Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| PKG-01 | Compliance & Submission | $8,570 | 36 |
| PKG-02 | Financial Proposal | $19,240 | 136 |
| PKG-03 | Team Qualifications | $5,960 | 52 |
| PKG-04 | Design Proposal | $46,550 | 338 |
| PKG-05 | Delivery Plan | $4,700 | 28 |
| PKG-06 | Construction Methodology | $6,560 | 40 |
| PKG-07 | Commissioning/Closeout | $3,290 | 22 |
| PKG-08 | Schedule & Milestones | $4,620 | 32 |
| PKG-09 | Due Diligence & Risk | $6,360 | 40 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$105,850** | **724** |

**NOTE:** PKG-01 production cost includes $3,500 surety broker fee (ALLOWANCE) in addition to $5,070 professional hours. PKG-01 bond/insurance premiums ($537,534) are NOT included in production total -- they are the SAME economic cost documented in DEL-05-01/05-02 construction content.

### 2. Construction Pricing Content (Separately Reported)

The actual proposal prices embedded in Schedule A and Schedule B.

| Item | Amount (CAD) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base Construction (excl. GST) | $9,863,000 | DEL-05-01 L-010 through L-022 |
| GST on Base (5%) | $493,000 | DEL-05-01 L-040 |
| Additional Options 1-6 (excl. GST) | $355,000 | DEL-05-01 L-030 through L-035 |
| GST on Options (5%) | $18,000 | DEL-05-01 L-041 |
| **Construction Pricing Content Total** | **$10,729,000** | DEL-05-01 / DEL-05-02 (same content) |

**NOTE:** DEL-05-01 (Schedule A) and DEL-05-02 (Schedule B) report the SAME $10,729,000. This is counted ONCE.

### 3. Grand Total Proposal Effort

| Component | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|
| Total Proposal Production Cost | $105,850 |
| Construction Pricing Content | $10,729,000 |
| **Grand Total** | **$10,834,850** |

Production cost is 0.98% of the grand total, reflecting that the vast majority of the proposal value is construction pricing content, not the hours to write the proposal.

## Evaluation-Weight-Adjusted View (BOE Section 7.4)

| Evaluation Category | Points | Primary Packages/DELs | Est. Hours | Est. Cost (CAD) | $/Point |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Compliance (Pass/Fail) | Pass/Fail | PKG-01 | 36 | $8,570 | N/A |
| Proposed Conceptual Design (20 pts) | 20 | DEL-02-01 | 228 | $29,610 | $1,481 |
| Design Brief + Sustainability (5 pts) | 5 | DEL-02-02 + DEL-02-03 | 110 | $16,940 | $3,388 |
| Durability/Maintenance (15 pts) | 15 | DEL-02-02 (portion) | ~40 | ~$6,085 | ~$406 |
| Delivery Plan (10 pts) | 10 | PKG-05 + PKG-06 + PKG-07 + PKG-08 | 122 | $19,170 | $1,917 |
| Team/Firms (15 pts) | 15 | PKG-03 | 52 | $5,960 | $397 |
| Proposal Price (35 pts) | 35 | PKG-02 | 136 | $19,240 | $550 |
| **Scored Total** | **100** | | **688** | **$97,280** | **$973** |

**Notes on the evaluation-weight-adjusted view:**

1. **DEL-02-02 contributes to BOTH "Design Brief" (5 pts) and "Durability/Maintenance" (15 pts)**. The 80 hours and $12,170 for DEL-02-02 are estimated to split approximately 50/50 between design brief content and durability/maintenance content, yielding ~40h / ~$6,085 per category. This is a rough allocation; actual split depends on authoring emphasis.

2. **Highest $/Point: Design Brief + Sustainability ($3,388/pt)**. The 5-point category requires $16,940 in production effort -- the least efficient point-to-cost ratio. This is driven by the multi-discipline nature of the consolidated design brief.

3. **Lowest $/Point: Durability/Maintenance ($406/pt) and Team/Firms ($397/pt)**. These categories achieve the best effort-to-point ratios, suggesting efficient allocation relative to scoring weight.

4. **Proposal Price (35 pts) at $550/pt** reflects only the PRODUCTION cost to fill in forms, not the construction pricing content ($10.7M) itself.

5. **PKG-09 (Due Diligence & Risk) is NOT scored** in the evaluation framework but costs $6,360 in production. It serves as a mandatory support package.

## Double-Counting Guards Applied

| Guard | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **G-001** | DEL-01-03 bond/insurance premiums ($537,534) vs DEL-05-01 L-021 bonds/insurance ($474,000) | Same economic cost documented in two places. DEL-01-03 premiums EXCLUDED from production total. Only DEL-01-03 production ($2,060) and broker fee ($3,500) counted as PKG-01 additive cost. |
| **G-002** | DEL-05-01 construction content ($10,729,000) vs DEL-05-02 construction content ($10,729,000) | Same construction pricing at summary vs detail level. Counted ONCE in project totals. |
| **G-003** | DEL-05-02 L-095/L-096 (temp facilities/temp power) | GR transparency rows NOT additive per estimate notes. Excluded from construction subtotal. |
| **G-004** | DEL-05-02 L-078 environmental compliance ($74k) includes $22k consultant fee that overlaps with L-106 ($22k) | Accepted as written in source Detail.csv. L-106 note states L-078 was reduced to $9,500 in derivation but the CSV carries $74k. Flagged as QA WARNING. Net impact: potential $22k double-count within DEL-05-02 construction content. |

## Warnings

1. **W-001 (MATERIAL):** All construction pricing content is PARAMETRIC/ALLOWANCE (no vendor quotes). Accuracy is +/-20-50%. Construction content ($10,729,000) should be treated as a planning-level estimate.

2. **W-002 (MATERIAL):** Professional hourly rates are market estimates, not actual firm rates. Production cost ($105,850) accuracy is +/-20-30%.

3. **W-003:** OI-004 (FF&E treatment) is implemented as $20k allowance per BOE recommendation but is still formally OPEN in decomposition.

4. **W-004:** OI-001 (Intent to Propose) assumed NOT submitted. If submitted, add ~2-4 admin hours ($210-$420) to PKG-01.

5. **W-005:** Bond/insurance premium rates are market estimates. Actual surety and insurance quotes must be obtained before proposal submission.

6. **W-006:** DEL-05-02 L-078/L-106 potential $22k environmental consulting overlap within construction content (see G-004).

7. **W-007:** No Risk_Register.md found for 20 of 21 snapshots (only DEL-08-01 had one). Project-level risk collection is sparse.
