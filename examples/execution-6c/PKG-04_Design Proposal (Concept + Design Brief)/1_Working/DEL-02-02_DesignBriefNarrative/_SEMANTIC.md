# Deliverable: DEL-02-02 DesignBriefNarrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** The Design Brief Narrative exists to articulate, across all building disciplines, the rationale connecting durability, maintainability, operational fitness, and material selection into a coherent design intent that demonstrates lifecycle stewardship of an integrated multi-function facility. It must carry the kind of knowledge that persuades an evaluator that design decisions are grounded in operational understanding and long-term ownership thinking.
