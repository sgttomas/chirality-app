- RFP Section 8.3, page 26 (scoring matrix)

**Verification:** Cross-check extraction against _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria and Specification.md requirements list.

---

### Step 1.5: Operational Discovery Engagement

**Action:** Schedule engagement with Fire Service and Public Works leadership to identify undocumented operational constraints beyond RFP text.

**Rationale:** RFP and OSR capture formal requirements, but operational realities (workflow preferences, equipment handling practices, emergency response procedures, maintenance access needs) often exceed documented scope. Early discovery prevents Design Brief from missing operationally critical considerations.

**Discovery Questions:**
- Fire Service: Response workflow from alert to apparatus deployment? Decontamination procedures? SCBA maintenance requirements? Bunker gear storage preferences? ICP setup and IT needs?
- Public Works: Equipment maintenance workflow? Parts inventory approach? Seasonal equipment storage patterns? Welding/fabrication frequency? Yard circulation preferences?
- Shared: Scheduling conflicts between departments? Meeting room usage patterns? Kitchen capacity needs during emergency operations?

**Output:** List of undocumented operational constraints to address in Design Brief narrative.

## Notes

### Timing and Sequencing

**Parallel Development Consideration:** DEL-02-02 (Design Brief Narrative) and DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package) are interdependent. The narrative describes the concept, and the concept visualizes the narrative.

**Recommended Approach:** Develop iteratively in parallel. Concept sketches inform narrative; narrative articulates concept decisions. Final coordination pass ensures consistency.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** - decomposition document does not specify sequence; practical proposal development suggests parallel work.

### Dependency on Concept Design

**Note:** This procedure assumes the Concept Design Package (DEL-02-01) is being developed concurrently or has been completed. The Design Brief Narrative describes the concept design approach; therefore, the concept must be sufficiently developed to write about.

**Coordination Checkpoints:**
- After Step 4 (discipline briefs drafted): Sync with concept design team to ensure narrative and visuals align
- After Step 6 (document integrated): Final cross-check with concept drawings/renderings

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on RFP Section 7.1.1-7.1.2 structure (conceptual design precedes/accompanies design brief)

### Handling Unknowns and TBDs

**Guidance:** This is a proposal-stage document, not detailed design. Some technical details are appropriately TBD at this stage.

**Acceptable TBDs:**
- Specific product manufacturers/models (note performance criteria instead)
- Detailed engineering calculations (note design approach and basis)
- Items requiring post-award survey or investigation (e.g., "foundation design informed by geotechnical report recommendations; specific foundation type TBD based on detailed bearing capacity analysis")

**Unacceptable TBDs:**
- RFP-mandated content (all five discipline briefs must be present and substantive)
- OSR-specified requirements (16' doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, etc. - these are firm requirements, not TBD)
- Design philosophy or approach (the narrative must articulate a clear design direction, even if details are TBD)

**Labeling:** Use **TBD** for items requiring further work; use **ASSUMPTION** for inferences made to maintain narrative flow; cite sources wherever possible.

**Source:** AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS.md, Step 4 guidance; Specification.md approach to TBD items

### Quality Over Quantity

**Reminder:** The Design Brief should be concise and substantive, not verbose. Evaluators review multiple proposals; clarity and credibility matter more than page count.

**Aim for:** Clear, confident narrative that demonstrates understanding of the project and operational requirements. Each sentence should add value.

**Avoid:** Generic boilerplate, over-promising, jargon without substance, redundancy across sections.

**Source:** RFP Section 4.1 (clear, concise, comprehensive), Guidance.md Principle 3 (operational efficiency over architectural expression)
