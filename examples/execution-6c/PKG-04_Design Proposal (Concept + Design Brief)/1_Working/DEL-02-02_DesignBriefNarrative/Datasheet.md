## Attributes

### Deliverable Characteristics

**Purpose:** Provide Design Brief narrative describing durability, maintenance, operational workflow, aesthetics, and materials rationale for the integrated Fire Hall and Public Works facility.

**Scope Coverage:**
- Architectural Design Brief (site plan, architectural plan, exterior elevations)
- Civil Design Brief (civil design, parking, street access, services, drainage)
- Structural Design Brief (structural solution considering cost, flexibility, expansion)
- Mechanical Design Brief (main mechanical systems)
- Electrical/IT Design Brief (power distribution, lighting, controls, communications, access control)

**Source:** RFP Section 7.1.2; _CONTEXT.md

**Target Audience:** Town of Penhold Evaluation Committee; Design-Build project team

**Evaluator Profile:** The Evaluation Committee likely includes Fire Chief, Public Works Superintendent, CAO, and elected officials. Decision criteria emphasize operational performance and cost-effectiveness over innovative architecture. Design Brief tone should emphasize proven regional approaches, practical solutions, and lifecycle cost justification rather than cutting-edge design concepts.

**Source:** RFP Section 8.2 (evaluation process); _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item F-006 (Lens F:evaluative:completeness)

**Format:** Narrative document (markdown/PDF)

### Evaluation Context

**Evaluation Weight:**
- **Price: 35 points** (highest weight - Design Brief must support cost-effectiveness narrative)
- Durability/Ease of Repair and Maintenance category: 15 points (RFP Section 8.3)
- Design Brief category: 5 points (RFP Section 8.3)
- Total Design Brief-influenced scoring: 20 points

**Strategic Implication:** Price scores 1.75x higher than Durability (35 vs. 20 points). Design Brief must support cost-effectiveness; durability materials must be justified via lifecycle cost analysis. Over-ambitious design without cost justification recovers no points.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Addresses RFP Section 7.1.2 requirements

## Conditions

### Site Conditions

**Developable Area:** 12 acres functional site (20 acres total parcel; 8 acres allocated to dog park/storm pond in flood fringe, not suitable for construction)

**Source:** Addendum 03, Section 1.1, page 1

### Environmental Hazards

**Operational Environment Challenges:** The Design Brief must explicitly address the hostile operational environment of a combined Fire Hall and Public Works facility:

- **Salt Exposure:** Fire apparatus and PW equipment track in road salt, sand, and de-icing chemicals; indoor surfaces subject to accelerated corrosion and degradation
- **Freeze-Thaw Cycles:** Alberta climate subjects building envelope and site elements to repeated freeze-thaw, causing spalling and material fatigue
- **High Moisture/Condensation:** Apparatus bays experience significant moisture from melting snow/ice on vehicles; cold storage susceptible to condensation and icing
- **Equipment Impacts:** Heavy apparatus and equipment cause impact loading on floors, walls, and door systems
- **Chemical Exposure:** Fire decontamination processes, equipment fluids, and maintenance operations introduce chemical stress on finishes

**Design Response Required:** Materials selection, detailing, and maintenance strategy must account for these environmental hazards to achieve 50-year life expectancy.
