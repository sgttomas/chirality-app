## Requirements

### RFP Mandatory Requirements

#### REQ-001: Design Brief Components (Mandatory)
**Requirement:** Provide complete Design Brief with all five discipline components as specified in RFP Section 7.1.2.

**Components:**
1. Architectural Design Brief - site plan, architectural plan, exterior elevations per OSR

### Material Selection Strategy (Canonical)

**Unified Material Selection Philosophy:** Materials shall be selected on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) over 50 years, not initial cost alone. The Design Brief must favor proven, regionally available materials with 25+ year track record in similar Alberta facilities. This canonical approach applies uniformly across all five discipline briefs to prevent fragmented or inconsistent material philosophies.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Durability:** Resist environmental hazards (salt, freeze-thaw, moisture, impacts) over 50-year life
2. **Maintainability:** Standard components, regional service availability, in-house maintenance feasible
3. **Regional Availability:** Materials and trades available in Central Alberta; avoid proprietary systems
4. **Lifecycle Cost:** Higher initial cost acceptable where TCO reduction is demonstrable

**Source:** Datasheet.md Construction section; Guidance.md Principle 2; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item C-002 (Lens C:normative:consistency)

---

### Requirement Prioritization

**Strategic Weighting:** Requirements should be prioritized based on evaluation scoring impact to ensure authoring effort aligns with competitive advantage:

| Priority | Requirements | Scoring Impact | Authoring Emphasis |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **CRITICAL** | REQ-006, REQ-007 (durability materials) | 15-point category | Maximum narrative depth; TCO justification; material examples |
| **HIGH** | REQ-001 through REQ-005 (Design Brief components) | 5-point category | Complete, substantive coverage; no gaps |
| **STANDARD** | All other requirements | Required but lower direct impact | Address fully but allocate less narrative space |

### Role Clarification: Design Brief as Primary Deliverable

**Design Brief Role:** The Design Brief Narrative (DEL-02-02) is the PRIMARY deliverable for this package, with 20-point scoring impact (5 pts Design Brief + 15 pts Durability). The Concept Design Package (DEL-02-01) provides visual complement to the narrative. Per RFP Section 7.1 structure, Design Brief is listed first and carries the written commitment language that evaluators score.

**Resource Allocation:** Author effort should reflect this primacy. Design Brief receives detailed narrative development; Concept Design provides visual support that aligns with narrative commitments.
