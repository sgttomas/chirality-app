## Principles

### Principle 1: Dual-Function Integration as Design Driver

**Context:** Unlike separate Fire Hall and Public Works facilities, this project explicitly requires shared spaces (offices, kitchen, meeting/ICP room) to reduce duplication and costs while maintaining operational independence where needed.

**Design Implication:** The Design Brief must demonstrate how architectural planning, access control, and circulation design balance:
- Shared resource efficiency (reduced footprint, lower capital and operating costs)
- Operational independence (24/7 fire response vs. daytime public works operations)
- Security and access zoning (volunteer firefighters vs. public works staff)
- Cross-departmental synergies (incident command capability, shared meeting spaces)

**Operational Stewardship Statement:** Design Brief must convey that the integrated design reflects joint operational review with Fire and Public Works leadership, demonstrating that dual-function approach is operationally credible (not merely cost-cutting). This operational endorsement strengthens evaluator confidence.

**Source (Operational Stewardship):** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item A-003 (Lens A:operative:guiding)

**Engineering Principle:** Use programmatic adjacency analysis and access control zoning to create "shared core" with "departmental wings" configuration. Fire apparatus bays and decontamination must be accessible 24/7; public works equipment bays may operate on secured schedule.

**Source:** RFP Section 2.2, page 7 (project background); RFP Appendix A, Section 10.2; Addendum 03, Section 1.15 (ICP capability)

**ASSUMPTION:** Access control system (Additional Optional Item 3) may influence base design layout even if not procured in initial phase; Design Brief should note access control zoning strategy.

---

### Principle 2: 50-Year Life Expectancy as Materials Selection Filter

**Context:** OSR explicitly requires 50-year life expectancy for main building, with low maintenance materials. This is NOT a typical commercial building lifespan (often designed for 25-30 years).

**Design Implication:** Materials selection must prioritize:
- Durability under harsh operational conditions (apparatus exhaust, equipment impacts, winter salt exposure, high traffic)
- Resistance to environmental degradation (Alberta climate: freeze-thaw cycles, UV exposure, wind-driven rain)
- Maintainability without specialized skills or proprietary systems
- Lifecycle cost optimization (higher initial cost acceptable if maintenance/replacement costs lower)

**Engineering Principle:** Evaluate materials on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) basis, not initial cost alone. Favor proven, regionally available materials over innovative/proprietary systems unless strong lifecycle justification exists.

**Empirical Grounding:** Comparable fire stations in Alberta with sealed concrete floors, brick or precast cladding, and standard HVAC systems have operated 40+ years with appropriate maintenance. This precedent demonstrates 50-year durability approach is feasible with proven materials and detailing, not experimental or unproven.

**Source (Empirical Precedent):** Industry experience with Alberta municipal facilities; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item B-003 (Lens B:knowledge:completeness)

**Examples:**
- Exterior: Precast concrete, brick veneer, metal panel systems (avoid EIFS, fiber cement in harsh exposure areas)
- Roofing: Thermoplastic membrane (TPO/PVC) or built-up roofing with proven 30+ year track record; design for re-roofing without structural modifications
- Doors: "Car wash grade" hardware for high-impact areas (salt, condensation, frequent operation)
- Flooring: Sealed concrete in apparatus/equipment bays (easy to repair, salt-resistant); commercial-grade resilient in offices

**Source:** RFP Appendix A, Section 10.2.1, page 37 (50-year life); Section 10.3.4, page 39 (low maintenance); Section 11.3, page 44 (durable materials)

**ASSUMPTION:** Specific product selections TBD during detailed design; Design Brief establishes material categories and performance criteria.

---

### Principle 3: Operational Efficiency Over Architectural Expression

**Context:** This is a working facility, not a civic monument. The RFP emphasizes cost-effectiveness, operational performance, and maintenance ease. Section 2.2 explicitly states the project is NOT schedule-driven, encouraging cost optimization.

**Design Implication:** Design Brief should demonstrate:
- Functional layouts that minimize travel distances (apparatus to street, equipment to yard, staff to shared spaces)
- Building forms that optimize structural efficiency (clear spans where needed, simple roof geometries for drainage and future solar)
- Systems that are straightforward to operate and maintain (avoid complex controls, proprietary systems)
- Aesthetic quality through good proportions, material quality, and detailing—not through complexity

**Aesthetic Vocabulary:** Contemporary industrial vocabulary appropriate for municipal/industrial building type: clean lines, bold simple forms, honest materials expression (precast, brick, metal panel). Avoid both over-designed civic monument aesthetic and bare-minimum industrial shed appearance. Quality through proportion and material integrity.

**Source (Aesthetic Guidance):** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item C-004 (Lens C:evaluative:consistency)

**Engineering Principle:** "Elegant simplicity" - achieve quality through thoughtful planning and material selection, not through ornament or complex geometries. Every design decision should have operational or lifecycle cost justification.

**Trap to Avoid:** Over-designing for aesthetics at the expense of cost-effectiveness. The evaluation criteria reward durability and maintenance (15 points) more heavily than conceptual design (20 points), and price is the highest category (35 points).

**Source:** RFP Section 2.2, page 8 (not schedule-driven; cost optimization); RFP Section 8.3, page 26 (evaluation weights); OSR Section 10.3.4 (cost-effective design)

---

### Principle 4: Future-Proofing Through Flexibility, Not Over-Sizing

**Context:** RFP Section 7.1.5 requires demonstration of adaptability, flexibility, and expansion potential. OSR Section 10.3.5 notes future personnel growth (Fire: 40→50; PW: 20→50).

**Design Implication:** Design Brief must articulate flexibility strategy:
- **Personnel growth:** Office and support space layout allows for future densification (open plan vs. fixed walls, modular furniture)
- **Equipment growth:** Bay layouts can accommodate additional small apparatus/equipment through reconfiguration
- **Building expansion:** Structural system and site layout permit future additions (column grids that extend, foundations sized for future loads, site circulation allows building footprint growth)
- **Systems capacity:** Electrical, HVAC, plumbing designed with spare capacity or clear expansion pathways (upsized services, space for additional equipment)

**Engineering Principle:** Design for "graceful expansion" - future additions should feel integral, not tacked-on. Structural grid, roof lines, and material palettes should anticipate expansion direction.

**Key Consideration:** 12-acre developable site provides ample expansion area. Design Brief should show site plan with future expansion zones identified.

**Source:** RFP Section 7.1.5, page 17; OSR Section 10.3.5, page 40 (personnel projections); Addendum 03, Section 1.1 (12-acre developable area)

**ASSUMPTION:** Expansion likely occurs in 15-25 year timeframe (when personnel approach 50/50 capacity). Design Brief notes expansion provisions without over-sizing initial construction.

---

### Principle 5: Energy Efficiency as Operational Cost Control

**Context:** OSR Section 10.3.4 requires "practical, energy efficient" design. Addendum 03 mandates solar-capable roofing. Town emphasizes lifecycle cost control.

**Resolving Simplicity vs. Energy Optimization Tension:** Principle 3 emphasizes operational simplicity; this Principle 5 emphasizes energy optimization. Resolution: HVAC is standard equipment (simplicity - no complex controls or cutting-edge systems); roof/envelope/lighting are energy-optimized where cost-justified over 50-year TCO (efficiency through proven measures, not innovation). This tiered approach achieves energy efficiency through standard systems rather than complex controls.

**Source (Tension Resolution):** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item B-004 (Lens B:wisdom:consistency)

**Design Implication:** Energy strategy integrated across disciplines:
- **Building envelope:** High-performance insulation, continuous air barrier, high-performance windows (balance daylighting with thermal performance)
- **HVAC:** Right-sized standard equipment, heat recovery where applicable (proven technology), destratification in high-bay spaces, zoning for different occupancy patterns (24/7 fire vs. daytime PW)
- **Lighting:** LED throughout with daylight harvesting and occupancy controls
- **Solar-ready:** Structural design for future solar loads (dead load + wind uplift), roof orientation optimized (south/west/southwest slope or flat with ballasted arrays), electrical service sized for future solar interconnection

**Engineering Principle:** Passive strategies first (orientation, insulation, daylighting), then efficient active systems, then renewable energy readiness. Payback analysis for energy measures should consider 50-year ownership.

**Cross-Reference:** DEL-02-03 (Sustainability and Energy Narrative) provides detailed energy efficiency and solar provisions. Design Brief summarizes integration into architectural, structural, and systems design.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.4, page 39; Addendum 03, Section 1.17, page 4 (solar-capable roof)

---

### Principle 6: Code Compliance as Minimum, Best Practice as Target

**Context:** RFP requires NBCC and ABC compliance (mandatory). Addendum 01 clarifies that functional program intentionally omits dimensions to allow innovation; spaces must "at minimum meet building code."

**Design Implication:** Design Brief should articulate where design exceeds code minimums for operational or lifecycle reasons:
- **Accessibility:** Universal design approach (not just code minimum accessible features)
- **Ventilation:** Fire apparatus bays get direct exhaust (exceeds general ventilation code minimum) for health/safety
- **Structural:** Design for operational loads (equipment impacts, future densification) may exceed code minimum live loads
- **Clearances:** Apparatus bay heights and door sizes accommodate largest anticipated equipment with operational margin

**Strategic Focus for Scoring:** Durability/Maintenance category (15 pts, highest scored component after price) rewards exceeding code on materials and systems. Accessibility and structure at code minimum is adequate (pass/fail). Author effort should emphasize durability narrative where exceeding-code provides scoring advantage.

**Source (Strategic Guide):** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item F-005 (Lens F:evaluative:necessity)

**Engineering Principle:** Code compliance is pass/fail gate; competitive advantage comes from demonstrating operational best practices and lifecycle thinking.

**Source:** Addendum 01 (room sizing flexibility); RFP Section 7.1.3 (accessibility); Addendum 03, Section 1.12 (fire apparatus exhaust)

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Materials Selection for Salt and Condensation Exposure

**Challenge:** Fire apparatus tracking in snow/ice/salt; public works equipment bringing in sand/salt; winter condensation in cold storage.

**Material Vulnerabilities:**
- Mild steel: Corrosion from salt exposure (door hardware, structural connections, mechanical equipment)
- Standard concrete: Salt degradation, freeze-thaw spalling (aprons, bay floors)
- Standard gypsum board: Moisture damage in high-humidity areas (near decontamination, apparatus bays in winter)
- Standard door hardware: Binding, corrosion, failure from salt/condensation

**Design Brief Response:**
- Specify "car wash grade" hardware for apparatus/equipment bay doors (stainless steel or heavily coated)
- Sealed concrete floors with densifier/hardener in high-traffic areas
- Stainless steel or powder-coated finishes for exposed structural elements in salt zones
- Moisture-resistant materials in decontamination and high-humidity areas
- Bay sumps with adequate drainage (Addendum 03 requirement) to minimize standing water

**Cost Implication:** Higher initial cost for upgraded materials justified by reduced maintenance and replacement frequency over 50-year life.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9, page 41-42 (car wash grade hardware); Addendum 03, Section 1.8 (bay sumps); industry best practices for fire stations and public works facilities

**ASSUMPTION:** Detailed material specifications developed during detailed design; Design Brief establishes material performance criteria.

---

### Consideration 2: Fire Department Operational Requirements

**Unique Fire Service Needs:**
- **24/7 access:** Volunteer firefighters must access apparatus bays, gear, and support spaces at any time
- **Rapid response:** Apparatus bay layout must minimize time from alarm to wheels rolling (direct path from living/office areas, minimized distance)
- **Decontamination:** NFPA and industry best practices now emphasize turnout gear decontamination separate from apparatus bays (prevent carcinogen exposure)
- **SCBA/breathing air:** Cascade system requires dedicated room with fresh air intake, separation from contaminated areas
- **Incident Command Post:** Meeting room must support emergency operations with backup power, robust IT infrastructure

**Design Brief Response:**
- Architectural Design Brief: Show circulation that supports rapid apparatus deployment
- Mechanical Design Brief: Direct exhaust ventilation in apparatus bays (Addendum 03 requirement) - explain system type (source capture vs. general exhaust)
- Electrical Design Brief: Backup generator loads include ICP/meeting room + kitchen + 2 bathrooms minimum; bay door backup (Addendum 03 requirement)
- Structural Design Brief: Apparatus bay clearances for Type 1 engines and Type 1 aerial (16' door height minimum per Addendum 03)

**Fire Service Best Practices Validation:** Consult fire service best practices (NFPA Station Design Guidelines, IAFC publications - available public domain) to validate design aligns with current industry standards. Design Brief should demonstrate familiarity with modern fire station functional requirements beyond RFP text.

**Source (Best Practices):** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item F-003 (Lens F:operative:sufficiency)

**Source:** Addendum 03, Sections 1.10, 1.12, 1.15, 1.16; RFP Appendix A, Section 10.2; industry best practices (NFPA, IAFC fire station design guidelines)

**Critical Expertise Requirement:** Design Brief authorship requires architect/engineer with prior fire station design experience. If Design-Builder team lacks this expertise, must engage fire station design consultant or partner with local Fire Chief as subject matter expert during design development. This ensures Design Brief reflects operational realities beyond RFP text.

**Source (Expertise Requirement):** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Items B-006, X-005 (Lenses B:wisdom:sufficiency, X:applying:necessity)

---

### Consideration 3: Public Works Maintenance and Storage Needs

**Unique Public Works Needs:**
- **Equipment variety:** From pickup trucks to tandem graders (see Appendix B Equipment List); bay sizing must accommodate largest equipment with maintenance access
- **Maintenance operations:** Welding, fabrication, fluid changes, parts storage - bay layout must support workflow
- **Cold storage strategy:** Seasonal equipment (mowers in winter, snow equipment in summer) - cold storage building removes pressure on heated bays
- **Yard operations:** Heavy equipment circulation, material storage, fueling - site layout must support exterior operations

**Design Brief Response:**
- Architectural Design Brief: Bay layout shows equipment + maintenance access; parts storage/warehouse zone; office location minimizes travel from yard
- Civil Design Brief: Yard circulation for heavy equipment; gravel/paved areas per OSR Section 10.3.7; truck turning radii verified
- Structural Design Brief: Bay floor loadings for equipment; clear spans to maximize flexibility; cold storage structural system (pole shed preferred per OSR)
- Mechanical Design Brief: Ventilation for occasional vehicle idling and very occasional welding (Addendum 03 clarification)

**Source:** RFP Appendix B (Equipment List and room program); OSR Section 10.3.7 (sitework); Addendum 03, Section 1.11 (ventilation clarification)

---

### Consideration 4: Shared Spaces Design and Access Control

**Tension to Resolve:** Shared spaces (kitchen, meeting/ICP, some offices) reduce costs and promote collaboration, BUT fire and public works have different operational hours, security needs, and access patterns.

**Design Strategies:**
- **Physical zoning:** Shared spaces form "core" with controlled access from both fire and public works "wings"
- **Access control tiers:** Public areas (meeting room when not in emergency use), departmental areas (fire gear room, PW shop), restricted areas (IT room, mechanical rooms)
- **Acoustic separation:** Meeting/ICP room must function during normal PW operations - locate away from high-noise areas or provide enhanced acoustic detailing
- **Future flexibility:** If departments eventually need separation (different ownership, service models), plan allows physical separation without major rework

**Design Brief Response:**
- Architectural Design Brief: Diagram showing zoning strategy, access control philosophy (even if system not initially procured)
- Electrical Design Brief: IT infrastructure supports both departments; meeting room has 15 concurrent internet access points for emergency operations

**Source:** RFP Section 2.2 (shared spaces goal); Addendum 03, Section 1.15 (ICP requirement); Additional Optional Item 3 (access control system)

**ASSUMPTION:** Access control zones identified in Design Brief even if physical system is optional; layout should not preclude future access control implementation.

---

### Consideration 5: Site Context and Environmental Constraints

**Site Opportunities:**
- 12-acre developable area provides ample space for building, parking, circulation, exterior storage, and future expansion
- Site grading completed by Town (cost/schedule benefit)
- Greenfield site (no demolition, minimal utility conflicts)

**Site Constraints:**
- 8 acres in flood fringe (dog park/storm pond) - not suitable for construction
- No on-site storm sewer; must route to natural drainage off-site
- Geotechnical conditions (see Geotechnical Report) may influence foundation type
- Wetland assessment and environmental considerations (salt storage removed from scope per Addendum 03 - eliminates environmental management plan complexity)

**Design Brief Response:**
- Civil Design Brief: Site layout respects 12-acre developable boundary; storm drainage strategy routes to natural discharge; grading minimizes winter ice/salt needs around buildings
- Structural Design Brief: Foundation solution responsive to geotechnical conditions (may require deep foundations, engineered fill, or other measures - TBD based on Geotechnical Report recommendations)
- Architectural Design Brief: Building placement optimizes solar orientation (south/west/southwest per Addendum 03), wind protection, and future expansion areas

**Source:** Addendum 03, Section 1.1 (12-acre developable); Section 1.2 (pickled sand removal); RFP Appendix A, Section 11.2 (storm drainage); RFP Section 2.3 (geotechnical, wetland, environmental reports)

---

### Consideration 6: Cost-Effectiveness and Value Optimization

**RFP Context:** Project is NOT schedule-driven; Owner emphasizes cost optimization and lifecycle value. Evaluation criteria place highest weight on price (35 points) but also reward durability/maintenance (15 points).

**Design Brief Strategy:**
- Demonstrate that material and system selections balance initial cost with lifecycle cost
- Show where higher initial investment yields operational savings (energy efficiency, maintenance reduction)
- Articulate cost-effective structural system (e.g., pre-engineered metal building vs. conventional steel vs. wood/steel hybrid - justify approach)
- Note opportunities for value engineering during detailed design (alternative materials, system optimization, phasing)

**Trap to Avoid:** Over-specifying premium materials without lifecycle justification. Evaluation committee (operations managers, CAO, protective services manager) will scrutinize lifecycle cost claims.

**Design Brief Tone:** Confident but not extravagant; emphasize practical solutions, proven systems, and regional availability of materials/trades.

**Source:** RFP Section 2.2, page 8 (not schedule-driven); RFP Section 8.3, page 26 (evaluation weights); RFP Section 8.5, page 28 (pricing considerations)

---

### Consideration 7: Operations and Maintenance Support

**Post-Handoff Commitment:** Design Brief should commit to operations support beyond construction completion:
- **Maintenance Manual:** Comprehensive O&M documentation for all building systems
- **Staff Training:** Training for Town maintenance staff on building systems operation
- **Troubleshooting Support:** 12-month post-substantial-completion support period for operational questions
- **Warranty Coordination:** Clear warranty documentation and manufacturer contact information

**Design Implication:** This commitment demonstrates lifecycle thinking and distinguishes proposal from competitors who stop at substantial completion. Operations support is implicit in quality proposals but rarely articulated.

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item C-003 (Lens C:operative:completeness); standard Design-Build best practices

---

## Value Orientation Statement

**Canonical Design Excellence Definition:** For this project, design excellence equals durability + operability + cost-effectiveness, in that priority order. This value hierarchy resolves potential trade-off conflicts: durability concerns take precedence over cost savings that would compromise longevity; operability takes precedence over aesthetic expression; cost-effectiveness is optimized within durability and operability constraints.

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item A-005 (Lens A:evaluative:guiding)

---

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Building Footprint vs. Two-Story Configuration

**Option A: Single-Story Spread**
- **Pros:** Fire apparatus and equipment bays must be single-story (operational requirement); single-story offices/shared spaces simplify structure, reduce elevator/stair cost, improve accessibility
- **Cons:** Larger building footprint; longer travel distances; larger roof area (higher cost, more maintenance)

**Option B: Partial Two-Story (Shared Spaces Above Grade)**
- **Pros:** Reduced footprint; shorter overall building dimensions; reduced roof area; Addendum 03 confirms two-story acceptable for shared spaces
- **Cons:** Elevator and stairs required (cost, space, maintenance); acoustic separation more critical; fire-rated construction for floor assembly

**Design Brief Guidance:**
- Addendum 03, Section 1.5 explicitly permits second story for shared spaces
- Evaluate based on site context (12 acres = ample space suggests single-story may be cost-effective)
- Consider lifecycle: two-story reduces roofing maintenance area but adds elevator maintenance
- **If single-story:** Justify with roof lifecycle cost, accessibility, and simplicity
- **If two-story:** Justify with reduced footprint, shorter utility runs, future expansion flexibility (build up vs. out)

**ASSUMPTION:** Design Brief presents chosen approach with trade-off rationale; does not require exhaustive analysis of both options.

**Source:** Addendum 03, Section 1.5, page 2

---

### Trade-off 2: Structural System Selection

**Options:**
- **Pre-Engineered Metal Building (PEMB):** Low cost, fast erection, proven for this building type; limited architectural expression, thermal bridging at frames
- **Conventional Steel Frame:** Flexibility in layout/aesthetics, easier future expansion; higher cost, longer fabrication/erection
- **Wood/Steel Hybrid:** Wood roof structure on steel columns; potential for exposed wood interior (warmth); fire rating and span limitations
- **Precast Concrete:** Durable exterior, integrated structure/envelope; higher cost, less flexible for future modifications

**Design Brief Guidance:**
- OSR Section 10.3.6 allows Design-Builder to select "cost-effective solution"
- Structural Design Brief must justify system selection based on:
  - Initial cost vs. lifecycle durability (50-year life requirement)
  - Span requirements (clear spans for apparatus/equipment bays, flexibility for future reconfigurations)
  - Future expansion provisions (system should extend logically)
  - Regional construction practices (availability of trades, materials)
  - Aesthetic integration (how structure contributes to building character)

**Likely Approach:** PEMB or conventional steel with architectural enhancements (brick veneer accent walls, metal panel color/texture variety) to achieve cost-effectiveness without industrial appearance.

**Source:** RFP Appendix A, Section 10.3.6, page 40 (cost-effective foundation/structure); Section 10.2.1 (50-year life expectancy)

---

### Trade-off 3: HVAC System Type

**Options:**
- **Unit Heaters + General Exhaust:** Low cost, simple; less comfort control, higher energy use in large volumes
- **Rooftop Units (RTUs) with Zoning:** Better comfort control, heat/cool capability for offices; higher initial cost, more maintenance
- **Radiant Heating + General Exhaust:** Comfortable heat in high bays, energy efficient; no cooling, requires low-temp hydronic system
- **Heat Recovery Ventilation:** Energy efficient; higher cost, more complex, requires ductwork

**Design Brief Guidance:**
- OSR Section 11.1 requires adequate ventilation per code + direct exhaust for fire apparatus bays
- Addendum 03 clarifies PW bays need ventilation for occasional idling/welding (not specialized exhaust)
- Energy efficiency is priority (OSR Section 10.3.4), but system must be practical and maintainable
- Consider zoning for different occupancy patterns: fire areas (24/7, intermittent high occupancy), PW areas (daytime, steady occupancy), offices (daytime, climate control)

**Mechanical Design Brief Content:**
- Articulate system type selection with energy, cost, and maintenance rationale
- Describe fire apparatus direct exhaust approach (source capture vs. general exhaust; equipment type)
- Address destratification in high bays (fans or system design)
- Note heat recovery opportunities if lifecycle cost justified

**Source:** RFP Appendix A, Section 11.1, page 43; Addendum 03, Sections 1.11-1.12

---

### Trade-off 4: Finish Quality in Shared Spaces vs. Operational Areas

**Tension:** Kitchen, meeting/ICP room, and offices are "public-facing" (staff comfort, potential for public use of meeting room); apparatus/equipment bays are purely functional.

**Design Brief Approach:**
- **Apparatus/Equipment Bays:** Durable, easy-clean finishes (sealed concrete floors, painted CMU or metal walls, exposed structure or simple ceiling); prioritize durability and maintenance over aesthetics
- **Shared Spaces:** Step up finish quality (resilient flooring, acoustic ceiling tiles, painted gypsum board, good lighting) for staff comfort and multi-use functionality
- **Offices:** Mid-grade commercial finishes (balance cost with staff comfort; these spaces influence recruitment/retention)
- **Support Spaces:** Code-minimum finishes (mechanical rooms, storage, etc.)

**Cost Implication:** Tiered finish strategy controls cost while providing quality where it matters for operations and staff well-being.

**Durability Consideration:** Even "nice" finishes in shared spaces must be durable (commercial-grade carpet tile vs. residential, solid-surface counters vs. laminate, commercial paint vs. residential).

**Design Brief Tone:** Demonstrate understanding that this is a working facility, not an office building; quality through durability and thoughtful design, not through luxury finishes.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.8 (flooring - sealed concrete for shared spaces); general best practices for municipal facilities

---

### Trade-off 5: Cold Storage Building System

**Options per OSR Section 10.3.8:**
- **Option 1 (Preferred):** Asphalt millings floor + 4' wide concrete strips for pallet racking; post-and-frame (pole shed) structure
  - **Pros:** Very low cost; adequate for unheated storage; simple maintenance
  - **Cons:** Asphalt millings may rut with heavy equipment; limited durability
- **Option 2:** Full concrete floor + concrete aprons; post-and-frame or light steel structure
  - **Pros:** More durable floor; better equipment operation; easier cleaning
  - **Cons:** Higher initial cost (concrete slab); may not be justified for unheated storage

**Design Brief Guidance:**
- Structural Design Brief presents Design-Builder's recommendation with cost/durability trade-off rationale
- Note that cold storage is 20-year life expectancy (not 50-year like main building) - influences cost-benefit analysis
- If Option 1: Demonstrate that asphalt millings adequate for anticipated use patterns
- If Option 2: Justify incremental cost with operational benefits or long-term durability

**Source:** RFP Appendix A, Section 10.3.8, page 41 (cold storage flooring options)

### Example 4: Expanded Durability Narrative Sample

**Sample prose demonstrating how to weave Considerations into Design Brief:**

> "The Penhold Public Services Building operates in a demanding environment: fire apparatus and public works equipment track salt, sand, and moisture into bays year-round; Alberta's climate subjects the envelope to repeated freeze-thaw cycles; and the 50-year ownership horizon demands materials that outlast typical commercial construction. Our durability strategy responds with proven regional approaches: sealed concrete floors with integrated hardener resist salt degradation and allow periodic diamond grinding to restore surface; precast concrete and brick cladding provide mass and thermal stability while resisting moisture intrusion; and "car wash grade" stainless steel door hardware withstands the salt-laden environment that destroys standard finishes within 5-10 years.
>
> This is not innovation for its own sake—it is disciplined application of materials with 40+ year track records in similar Alberta facilities. The incremental initial cost is justified by dramatically reduced maintenance and replacement over the Town's 50-year ownership. Our maintenance strategy emphasizes in-house serviceability: standard HVAC equipment serviceable by regional contractors, lighting fixtures with common LED modules, and accessible mechanical spaces that don't require specialized equipment to reach."

**Purpose:** This sample demonstrates how to integrate environmental hazards (Consideration 1), 50-year life rationale (Principle 2), and cost-effectiveness messaging (Consideration 6) into cohesive proposal prose.

## Design Brief Completion Checklist (Go/No-Go Gates)

The following checklist establishes objective completion criteria for Design Brief authoring:

**Content Completeness:**

## Notes

**ASSUMPTION:** Design Brief principles and considerations based on industry best practices for fire stations and public works facilities, combined with specific RFP requirements. Detailed engineering analysis occurs in subsequent design phases.

**ASSUMPTION:** Trade-offs presented reflect typical decision points for this facility type; actual Design Brief will articulate Design-Builder's specific choices with project-specific rationale.

**TBD:** Integration with Additional Optional Items (wash bay, yard lighting, access control, security/cameras, signage, appliances) - if Design-Builder proposes optional items, Design Brief should note how they integrate with base design without creating dependencies.

**Cross-Reference:** This Guidance document informs content development for the actual Design Brief Narrative deliverable. Procedure.md describes workflow for producing the Design Brief.
