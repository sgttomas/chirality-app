# Guidance: DEL-02-01 Concept Design Package

## Purpose

This Concept Design Package exists to demonstrate the Design-Build team's understanding of the Owner's requirements and their ability to deliver a functional, code-compliant, and operationally effective integrated Fire Hall and Public Works facility.

**Context:** This is a proposal-stage deliverable. Its primary audience is the Town of Penhold evaluation committee. The concept must be sufficiently detailed to convey design intent and functional compliance, but not so detailed as to constrain innovation or over-commit resources at the proposal stage.

**Evaluation Impact:** This deliverable directly supports the "Proposed Conceptual Design" evaluation criterion (20 points out of 100) and indirectly supports "Design Brief" (5 points) and "Durability / Ease of Repair & Maintenance" (15 points) by establishing the design foundation.

**[F-004 TBD Question]** Non-negotiable evaluative objectivity requires definition of what constitutes "acceptable" vs. "excellent" concept in measurable terms. Proposal Manager should create detailed evaluation rubric for RFP submission and provide to Lead Architect before design. Example scoring framework: "R1 Program Fit: 10 pts = all spaces present + optimal adjacencies + schedule fits program; 7 pts = all spaces present + adequate adjacencies; 4 pts = most spaces present; 0 pts = incomplete." Repeat for R2-R14 and major evaluation categories. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item F-004 (Matrix F: evaluative:necessity).

## Principles

### P1: Functional Clarity Over Aesthetic Refinement

**Principle:** At the concept stage, clarity of functional layout, program fit, and operational workflow is more valuable than refined aesthetics or detailed material selections.

**Rationale:** The RFP evaluation focuses on demonstrating that the team understands the operational needs of a combined Fire Hall and Public Works facility. Evaluators need to see that:
- Fire apparatus can efficiently enter, exit, and be maintained
- Public works vehicles and equipment have appropriate circulation and storage
- Staff areas support operational readiness and wellness
- The two functions coexist without operational conflict

**[B-003 Enrichment]** P1 prioritizes functional clarity (supported by 20-point concept criterion and 15-point durability criterion) over aesthetic detail (5-point Design Brief criterion). Total 35 points reward functional excellence; 5 points reward aesthetic refinement. Effort allocation should reflect this weighting. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item B-003 (Matrix B: information:sufficiency). Decomposition §15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk).

**Application:**
- Prioritize clear, dimensioned plans showing circulation, apparatus bays, and support spaces
- Use simple massing studies to show scale and form
- Reserve detailed material palettes and finishes for the Design Brief narrative (DEL-02-02)

**Trade-off:** A highly rendered concept with poor functional layout will score lower than a clear, functional plan with simple graphics.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Based on evaluation criteria emphasis (20 points for concept, 15 points for durability/maintenance, 5 points for design brief) and municipal client priorities for operational facilities.

---

### P2: Compliance Transparency

**Principle:** Where the concept demonstrates code compliance or standard adherence, make it visible and explicit.

**Rationale:** Evaluators must trust that the Design-Build team understands regulatory constraints. Showing accessible routes, egress paths, occupancy separations, and life safety provisions builds confidence without requiring full code analysis at the proposal stage.

**Application:**
- Label accessible parking, routes, and entrances on site and floor plans
- Show fire separations between Fire Hall and Public Works zones (if required by occupancy analysis)
- Dimension critical items like apparatus bay door heights (16 ft clear)
- Include brief compliance notes on drawings (e.g., "Accessible route per ABC Part 3")

**[E-002 Enrichment]** Compliance evidence standard for proposal: (1) Draw accessible routes/egress on plans with labels, (2) Include code reference on drawing (e.g., "Accessible route: CSA B651 §4.2"), (3) Support with brief narrative note for major categories (e.g., "All egress travel distances ≤ [X] m per ABC Table 3.4.3.1"). Detailed code calculations not required at concept stage but shall be available for peer review (Procedure Step 9.3). Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item E-002 (Matrix E: operative:sufficiency). Validated systemic fitness requires clarity on compliance evidence standard.

**Trade-off:** Over-documenting code compliance can clutter drawings; under-documenting creates doubt about team competence.

**Source:** Decomposition §9 (SOW-015: accessibility narrative required); Specification R11, R12 (code compliance and accessibility requirements)

---

### P3: Site Responsiveness

**Principle:** The concept must visibly respond to site opportunities and constraints, particularly the 12-acre developable area and flood fringe boundary.

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 clarified the site constraint (8 acres in flood fringe). Demonstrating awareness of this constraint and designing within the 12-acre developable area shows due diligence and risk management.

**Application:**
- Delineate the 12-acre developable boundary clearly on site concept plans
- Locate buildings, parking, and hardstand areas within developable zone
- Show dog park and storm pond in flood fringe area (as context, not as proposal scope)
- Reference geotechnical and wetland constraints in concept narrative

**Trade-off:** Ignoring site constraints risks non-compliance or unrealistic cost assumptions; over-constraining the design may sacrifice functional optimization.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03: 12-acre developable area); Specification R2 (site developable area requirement)

---

### P4: Operational Flexibility

**Principle:** Design for the current program while showing adaptability for future needs (expansion, technology changes, operational evolution).

**Rationale:** The RFP requires a narrative on adaptability/flexibility/expansion (SOW-014). Municipal facilities often need to accommodate growth or changing equipment (larger apparatus, electric vehicle charging, etc.).

**Application:**
- Show expansion zones on site plan (e.g., "Future expansion area")
- Design structural and service systems with capacity headroom
- Avoid site layout that "land-locks" the building or blocks future additions
- Address adaptability explicitly in concept narrative or Design Brief

**Trade-off:** Over-designing for hypothetical future uses can inflate proposal cost; under-designing creates obsolescence risk.

**Source:** Decomposition §9 (SOW-014: "Provide adaptability/flexibility/expansion narrative")

---

### P5: Integration of Addendum 03 Technical Requirements

**Principle:** All technical clarifications from Addendum 03 must be addressed explicitly in the concept or supporting narrative.

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 provided critical design details (16 ft doors, bay sumps, exhaust system, generator, fill stations, solar-ready roof). Failure to address these items signals inattention to RFP amendments and creates doubt about proposal completeness.

**Application:**
- Show 16 ft door height on sections (dimension and label)
- Indicate bay sump locations on floor plan (symbol or note)
- Allocate space for fire apparatus exhaust system (ceiling-mounted or overhead)
- Show generator location on site plan (setback, noise considerations)
- Show fill station location(s) with vehicular access
- Orient roof for solar readiness and note structural provisions

**Trade-off:** None — these are hard requirements. Omission constitutes non-compliance.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 technical clarifications); Specification R3–R8

## Considerations

### Design Stage and Deliverable Maturity

**Context:** This is a **concept-level** deliverable for **proposal evaluation**, not a construction document set.

**Implications:**
- Drawings should be clear and dimensioned but not fully detailed
- Engineering systems should be sized conceptually (e.g., "Generator to support ICP and critical loads; size TBD pending detailed load analysis")
- Cost estimates in PKG-02 will be based on this concept; major scope gaps or ambiguities will propagate to pricing uncertainties
- If selected, the Design-Build team will refine this concept through detailed design and permitting

**Decision Point:** How much detail to show?
- **Too little:** Evaluators cannot assess functional compliance or constructability
- **Too much:** Wastes proposal effort and may over-commit to details that need flexibility

**Recommendation:** Target "schematic design" level of detail (per typical design phase definitions). Show enough to convey intent and demonstrate compliance, but leave detailed resolution for post-award design development.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard practice for Design-Build proposal concept packages; confirmed by decomposition context (proposal response objective, not construction readiness)

---

### Program Fit and Room Sizing

**Context:** Addendum 01 clarified that the Functional Program (Appendix B) intentionally omits many room dimensions to allow design innovation, with the requirement that all spaces meet minimum building code requirements. Addendum 03 provided sample room size ranges for selected spaces.

**Implications:**
- The concept plan must show all program spaces (room list verification required)
- Room sizes are somewhat flexible, allowing optimization for circulation and functional adjacencies
- Very small rooms (e.g., storage, electrical rooms) must still meet code minimums for access, clearances, and egress
- Sample room size ranges (from Addendum 03) provide guidance but are not hard constraints

**Decision Point:** Should the concept show exact room dimensions or approximate sizes?
- **Exact dimensions:** Provides clarity for cost estimating but may constrain later optimization
- **Approximate sizes:** Allows flexibility but may create ambiguity for evaluators

**Recommendation:** Show approximate room dimensions on concept plans (e.g., "Apparatus Bay 1: ~50 x 70 ft") with a note that dimensions are subject to refinement. Cross-check against Addendum 03 sample ranges where provided.

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 01 and 03 clarifications); Specification R1, R10

---

### Fire Hall and Public Works Operational Separation

**Context:** The building integrates two distinct operational functions:
1. **Fire Hall:** Emergency response, apparatus maintenance, firefighter readiness (24/7 staffing)
2. **Public Works:** Municipal services, equipment maintenance, seasonal operations (typically daytime staffing)

**Implications:**
- These functions have different operational rhythms, noise profiles, and security requirements
- Fire apparatus must have unimpeded access for emergency response (no conflicts with public works vehicle movements)
- Staff areas (offices, break rooms, washrooms, locker rooms) may be shared or separated depending on Town preferences
- Building code may require occupancy separations if the two functions have different occupancy classifications (TBD: requires code analysis)

**Decision Point:** Should the concept show integrated or separated zones?
- **Integrated:** Shared circulation, shared staff areas, unified building form
- **Separated:** Distinct wings or buildings, separate entrances, fire-rated separation wall

**[B-005 TBD Question]** Has Town of Penhold indicated preference for integrated or separated Fire Hall/Public Works zones? If available in RFP Appendix A, cite in Guidance. If not, should Design Brief include rationale study showing both options? Risk: Design may conflict with unstated Town preference, resulting in low evaluation score. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item B-005 (Matrix B: wisdom:consistency).

**Recommendation:** The concept should show functional zoning (Fire Hall zone vs. Public Works zone) with clear circulation paths. The degree of separation (shared wall vs. separated buildings) is a design decision to be documented in the Design Brief narrative (DEL-02-02) with rationale (operational efficiency, code compliance, cost, phasing flexibility).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard design consideration for combined emergency services and public works facilities; specific Town preference TBD (requires OSR review)

---

### Site Access and Circulation

**Context:** The facility requires:
- Fire apparatus entry/exit (emergency response priority)
- Public works vehicle entry/exit (large trucks, equipment)
- Staff parking (Fire Hall and Public Works personnel)
- Public access (if applicable, e.g., for permit/service counter)
- Service/delivery access

**Implications:**
- Site circulation must prevent conflicts between emergency apparatus egress and other vehicle movements
- Apparatus bays typically face a public street for rapid response
- Public works yard may require secure perimeter (fencing) to control access to equipment and materials
- Fill stations must be accessible to both fire apparatus and public works vehicles without circulation conflicts

**Decision Point:** Single access point vs. multiple access points?
- **Single access:** Simpler site design, easier access control, potential circulation conflicts
- **Multiple access:** Separates emergency and non-emergency traffic, more complex site layout

**Recommendation:** Show primary access for fire apparatus (direct to apparatus bays) and separate or secondary access for public works yard. Locate fill stations in a position accessible to both functions without cross-traffic conflicts.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard practice for emergency services facilities; Specification R7 (fill stations requirement)

---

### Solar-Ready Roof Orientation

**Context:** Addendum 03 requires "solar capable roof/orientation." This implies:
- Roof form and orientation should maximize solar energy potential (south-facing in northern hemisphere)
- Roof structure should be designed to carry future photovoltaic (PV) panel loads (snow, wind, dead load)
- Electrical infrastructure should accommodate future PV interconnection (e.g., conduit runs, panel capacity)

**Implications:**
- Building orientation affects solar access but also affects site layout, apparatus bay access, and daylighting
- Roof form (gable, hip, flat, sawtooth) affects PV installation complexity and area
- Long-span roof structures (typical for apparatus bays) may require specific design for PV loads

**Decision Point:** Optimize for solar vs. optimize for site/operational constraints?
- **Solar priority:** South-facing roof, maximum unobstructed area
- **Operational priority:** Apparatus bay orientation toward street, functional site layout

**Recommendation:** Balance both. Show a roof form that provides reasonable solar access (e.g., south-facing slopes or flat roof suitable for tilted PV arrays) while maintaining functional building orientation. Document the solar-ready provisions in the Sustainability & Energy Narrative (DEL-02-03) with structural load assumptions.

**Source:** Specification R8 (solar-ready roof); Decomposition §9 (SOW-012: sustainability/energy narrative)

---

### Cost Implications of Concept Decisions

**Context:** The concept design directly informs the financial proposal (PKG-02, DEL-05-01/02/03). Major cost drivers include:
- Building footprint and gross floor area
- Structural system (long-span apparatus bays, roof form)
- Site development extent (grading, paving, services)
- Technical systems (generator size, exhaust system, fill stations)

**Implications:**
- An overly ambitious concept (large building, complex form, extensive site improvements) may result in a non-competitive price
- An overly minimal concept (tight spaces, minimal amenities) may score poorly on functionality and durability/maintenance criteria
- Cost assumptions must align with concept scope (e.g., generator size estimate must match "supports ICP and critical loads" requirement)

**Decision Point:** Optimize for low cost vs. optimize for high evaluation score?
- **Low cost priority:** Minimal building size, simple form, basic systems
- **High score priority:** Generous spaces, robust materials, comprehensive systems

**Recommendation:** Target "good value" — a concept that meets all program and technical requirements, demonstrates operational effectiveness, and positions for high evaluation scores (particularly the 15-point durability/maintenance criterion) without gold-plating. Cost optimization should focus on constructability (simple forms, efficient structure) rather than scope reduction.

## Trade-offs

**[C-004 Enrichment]** Impartial evaluation discipline requires decision framework tied to evaluation criteria. For each trade-off below, consider estimated impact on RFP point allocation: 20 concept + 15 durability + 5 brief = 40 design-related points; 35 price points. Designer needs to know how choice impacts scoring. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item C-004 (Matrix C: evaluative:consistency).

### T1: Building Form — Compact vs. Spread-Out

**Tension:**
- **Compact form:** Smaller footprint, more efficient structure, lower heating/cooling cost, easier future expansion
- **Spread-out form:** Better daylighting, easier circulation, more flexibility for functional zoning, simpler construction phasing

**Impact:**
- Compact form may reduce site disturbance (relevant for wetland/environmental constraints) and reduce building cost per square foot, but may create tighter adjacencies between Fire Hall and Public Works zones (noise, vibration, operational conflicts).
- Spread-out form may provide better functional separation and expansion flexibility but increases site development cost and building perimeter (envelope cost).

**Evaluation Impact Estimate:**
- Compact form: +5 points on cost efficiency (35-point price criterion) but potentially -3 points on durability/maintenance if tight adjacencies create operational stress. Net: +2 if daylighting not critical.
- Spread-out form: -3 points on cost (larger footprint) but +3 points on operational flexibility. Net: neutral, but stronger durability narrative.

**Resolution Approach:** Balance functional zoning needs with cost efficiency. A "winged" or "L-shaped" plan may provide functional separation while sharing core infrastructure (mechanical/electrical rooms, circulation).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Standard architectural design trade-off for multi-function facilities

---

### T2: Site Layout — Integrated vs. Separated Yards

**Tension:**
- **Integrated yard:** Fire apparatus and public works vehicles share outdoor equipment/storage areas and circulation; simpler site layout, lower site development cost
- **Separated yards:** Fire apparatus area is separate from public works equipment yard; clearer operational boundaries, better security control, avoids cross-traffic conflicts

**Impact:**
- Integrated yard may create circulation conflicts during emergency response (public works vehicles blocking apparatus egress) and complicates security (public works yard often needs controlled access for equipment/materials).
- Separated yards provide operational clarity and resilience but require more site area, more fencing/gates, and potentially duplicate site infrastructure (lighting, drainage).

**Resolution Approach:** Functionally separate the apparatus apron (immediately outside apparatus bay doors) from the public works equipment yard, but allow shared access drives and parking areas where operational conflicts are unlikely.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Operational best practice for combined emergency services and public works facilities

---

### T3: Roof Form — Flat vs. Sloped

**Tension:**
- **Flat roof:** Easier to design for solar panels (can use tilted racks), simpler structure, easier future roof access/maintenance
- **Sloped roof (gable/hip):** Traditional appearance, positive drainage, may provide better solar orientation (south-facing slope), may be preferred by municipality for aesthetic/contextual reasons

**Impact:**
- Flat roof provides flexibility for PV array layout and is typical for industrial/utilitarian buildings, but may not align with municipal expectations for a civic building (Fire Hall often has symbolic/landmark role in community).
- Sloped roof provides architectural character and aligns with residential context (if applicable) but constrains PV array placement to specific roof planes and may increase structural complexity.

**Resolution Approach:** Consider a hybrid — flat or low-slope roof over public works bays (utilitarian, solar-optimized) and a more articulated roof form over fire apparatus bays and public areas (civic identity). Document rationale in Design Brief (DEL-02-02).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: Architectural design consideration; Specification R8 (solar-ready roof requirement)

---

### T4: Level of Detail in Concept Drawings

**Tension:**
- **High detail:** Fully dimensioned plans, detailed elevations, material callouts, system diagrams — provides clarity for evaluators and estimators but requires significant proposal effort
- **Low detail:** Schematic plans, simple massing, minimal notation — faster to produce and allows flexibility for post-award refinement, but may leave evaluators uncertain about compliance or constructability

**Impact:**
- High detail increases proposal cost (design hours) and may over-commit the team to specific solutions before detailed engineering and owner input.
- Low detail may result in lower evaluation scores if evaluators cannot assess program fit, code compliance, or operational effectiveness.

**Resolution Approach:** Target "schematic design" level — clear, dimensioned plans showing all program spaces; simple sections and elevations showing key dimensions (like 16 ft door height); massing study showing form and scale; supporting narrative addressing compliance and technical requirements. Avoid detailed material specifications, construction details, or system engineering at this stage.

## Examples

### Example 1: Apparatus Bay Layout (Functional Clarity)

**Context:** Fire apparatus bays are the operational heart of a fire hall. The concept must show:
- Number of bays (determined by Functional Program)
- Bay dimensions (width and depth to accommodate apparatus)
- Door height (16 ft clear, per Addendum 03)
- Sump locations (per Addendum 03)
- Exhaust system space (per Addendum 03)
- Circulation (apparatus ingress/egress; personnel access)

**Good Practice:**
- Show each bay clearly labeled (e.g., "Bay 1: Engine 1," "Bay 2: Tanker," etc.)
- Dimension bay clear width and depth (e.g., "14 ft wide x 60 ft deep")
- Show door swing/operation (overhead sectional door, typically)
- Indicate sump locations with a symbol and note
- Show overhead space for exhaust capture system (section view or plan note)
- Show personnel door access from apparatus bays to staff areas (turnout gear storage, washrooms)

**Reference:** Typical fire station design guidelines (NFPA, FEMA); specific bay count and apparatus types from RFP Appendix B (TBD).

**Source:** Specification R3, R4, R5 (door height, sumps, exhaust system requirements); ASSUMPTION: Standard fire hall design practice

---

### Example 2: Site Concept — Developable Area Delineation

**Context:** Addendum 03 clarified that only 12 acres of the 20-acre site are developable (8 acres in flood fringe for dog park and storm pond). The site concept must visibly demonstrate compliance with this constraint.

**Good Practice:**
- Draw site boundary showing full 20-acre parcel
- Overlay flood fringe area (8 acres) with hatching or shading and label "Flood Fringe — Dog Park & Storm Pond (not in building scope)"
- Delineate 12-acre developable area with a bold boundary line and label "12-Acre Developable Area"
- Place all building footprints, parking, driveways, and hardstand areas within the 12-acre boundary
- Provide a site area summary table:
  - Total site area: 20 acres
  - Developable area: 12 acres
  - Building footprint: [X] acres
  - Paved areas: [Y] acres
  - Remaining developable area: [Z] acres

**Reference:** Flood zone mapping (AB-2024-07156-Penhold PSB_parcel flood zone.pdf, location TBD).

**Source:** Specification R2 (site developable area requirement); Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03)

---

### Example 3: Generator Location and Access

**Context:** Addendum 03 requires an emergency generator to support the Incident Command Post (ICP) and critical building systems. The concept must show generator location and consider operational factors.

**Good Practice:**
- Locate generator on site plan in a position that:
  - Is accessible for fuel delivery (propane or diesel truck)
  - Meets setback requirements from building and property lines (for noise and exhaust clearance)
  - Minimizes noise impact on occupied areas (away from offices, sleeping quarters if applicable)
  - Has clearance for maintenance access (technician access, replacement/removal if needed)
- Show generator as a schematic symbol or box labeled "Emergency Generator (size TBD per load analysis)"
- Indicate fuel tank location (if applicable — may be integral to generator or separate)
- Note electrical connection route to building (underground or overhead)
- Address generator sizing in concept narrative or electrical engineering assumptions (TBD: detailed load calculation required for precise sizing)

**Reference:** Generator manufacturer clearance requirements (typical); electrical code clearances (TBD).
