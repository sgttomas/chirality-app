# Specification: DEL-02-01 Concept Design Package

## Scope

### In Scope

This Concept Design Package deliverable encompasses:

1. **Concept plan(s)** showing functional layout and spatial relationships for the integrated Fire Hall + Public Works facility
2. **Building massing** studies demonstrating volumetric relationships and form
3. **Key sections and elevations** illustrating vertical relationships and external appearance
4. **Site concept plan** showing building placement on the 12-acre developable area

**Purpose:** Demonstrate program fit and compliance with Owner Statement of Requirements (OSR) for RFP proposal evaluation.

**[D-001 Clarification Required]** Does Concept Design Package (DEL-02-01) scoring come from "20 points for Proposed Conceptual Design" alone, or does it also contribute to "Design Brief" (5 pts) and "Durability/Maintenance" (15 pts)? How are points allocated across DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-02-03? Design effort allocation depends on answer. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item D-001 (Matrix D: normative:applying).

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (Description, Anticipated Artifacts); Decomposition §8 (DEL-02-01 definition)

### Out of Scope

The following are explicitly excluded from this deliverable:

1. **Pickled Sand Storage Building** — Removed from RFP scope per Addendum 03; to be issued as separate RFP
2. **Detailed design drawings** — This is a concept-level package for proposal evaluation, not construction documentation
3. **Working drawings or construction details** — Not required at proposal stage
4. **Final engineering calculations** — Concept-level sizing only
5. **FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment)** — May be addressed separately per Addendum 03 clarification

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03); §8 (DEL-02-01 Acceptance Criteria)
