# Deliverable: DEL-02-01 Concept Design Package

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to convey, through concept-level spatial and site layouts, that a proposed integrated emergency services and public works facility fulfills the owner's functional program within constrained site boundaries. It must carry knowledge of how building form, operational zoning, and technical provisions demonstrate program fit and regulatory responsiveness at the proposal evaluation stage.
