## Verification

### Verification Methods

| Verification Method | Applied To | Responsible Party | Timing | Pass/Fail Criteria |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Content Review** | All requirements | Lead Architect / Designer (narrative author) | After Step 4 (draft completion) | All "shall" requirements have substantive content (not merely mentioned) |
| **Cross-Document Consistency Check** | Alignment with DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-06-01, DEL-09-02 | Proposal Manager / QA Lead | Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Consistency Check) | No material contradictions between deliverables; minor inconsistencies documented |
| **Code Compliance Check** | REQ-002 (energy), REQ-003 (solar-ready), Standards section | Building Code Consultant / Sustainability Specialist | After Step 5 (technical review) | **Pass:** All code references accurate for specified edition; envelope R-values, mechanical efficiencies correct. **Fail:** Incorrect code edition cited or values not aligned with specified code. **Ruling authority:** Building Code Consultant (per Lensing A-003, X-001) |
| **Evaluation Criteria Alignment** | REQ-001.4 (Design Brief scoring, Durability/Maintenance scoring) | Proposal Manager (check against RFP Section 9 rubric **[TBD — location TBD]**) | After Step 5 (technical review) | Content explicitly supports 15-point Durability and 5-point Design Brief categories |
| **Peer Review** | Technical credibility, clarity, persuasiveness (REQ-008) | Senior Architect / Independent Reviewer | After Step 6 (revised draft) | **Note (Lensing D-005):** Peer reviewer should have qualifications to judge LCCA credibility and validate cost assumptions if life-cycle claims are included |
| **Compliance Matrix Check** | All mandatory requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-008 "shall" items) | Proposal Manager / Compliance Lead (via DEL-01-01) | Step 8 (compliance matrix check) | **Pass/Fail rubric (per Lensing A-003):** Each mandatory requirement verified as "Substantively Addressed" (pass), "Partially Addressed" (conditional pass — requires remediation), or "Not Addressed" (fail) |
| **File Size Check** | REQ-008.3 (contribution to 15 MB PDF limit) | Proposal Manager (PDF assembly — DEL-01-02) | Step 9 (finalization) | Narrative contribution ≤2 MB including diagrams |

**Conflict Definition (per Lensing X-003):** A "conflict" for Acceptance Criteria §5 means: (a) Material contradiction — statement in one deliverable directly contradicts another (e.g., solar orientation differs); (b) Severity threshold — minor technical differences (e.g., setpoint temperature varies by 1°C) are acceptable; material contradictions affecting compliance or evaluation must be resolved.

### Acceptance Criteria

The deliverable meets specification when:

1. **Mandatory Requirements Met:**
   - All "shall" requirements (REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004.3, REQ-005.2, REQ-006.1, REQ-007.1, REQ-008) are **substantively addressed** (not merely mentioned) in the narrative content. **Definition of "addressed" (per Lensing E-001):** Requirement is developed with sufficient technical detail to demonstrate compliance understanding (e.g., solar-ready section includes structural load allowance, electrical provisions, orientation rationale — not just "we will provide solar-ready provisions").
   - Compliance mapping table confirms all mandatory items covered (Step 8).

2. **Solar-Ready Provisions Addressed:**
   - REQ-003.1–003.5 are comprehensively described with sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with Addendum 03 "solar capable roofing" requirement.
   - Narrative explains structural, electrical, orientation, access, and value proposition for solar-ready design.

3. **Code-Aware and Credible:**
   - Narrative references applicable codes/standards (ABC, NECB edition numbers and key sections) (REQ-001.2).
   - Technical content is accurate and appropriate for proposal stage (REQ-008.2).
   - No technical errors identified during code compliance review.

4. **Evaluation-Ready:**
   - Content supports Design Brief evaluation criteria (5 points) and Durability/Maintenance evaluation criteria (15 points) (REQ-001.4) **[TBD: pending RFP Section 9 rubric review — location TBD]**.
   - Narrative is clear, persuasive, and suitable for municipal evaluators (REQ-008.1).
   - Narrative emphasizes life-cycle value, operational efficiency, and alignment with Town's priorities.

5. **Cross-Document Consistency:**
   - Aligns with Concept Design (DEL-02-01), Design Brief (DEL-02-02), Site Conditions (DEL-09-02), and Commissioning (DEL-06-01).
   - No conflicts with other deliverables; cross-references are accurate. **Note (per Lensing C-003):** Scope boundary vs. DEL-02-02 (Design Brief) and DEL-06-01 (Commissioning) must be explicitly defined to avoid duplication or gaps — commissioning approach in DEL-02-03 should cross-reference DEL-06-01 rather than duplicate procedural content.
   - Clear boundaries maintained (DEL-02-03 = energy systems/sustainability strategy; DEL-02-02 = materials/construction/operations).

6. **Appropriate Length and Format:**
   - Narrative is 4-6 pages (approximately 2,000-3,000 words) (REQ-008.3).
   - File size contribution is within budget for 15 MB total PDF limit.
   - Formatting is consistent and professional. **Note (per Lensing E-002):** Formatting standard **TBD** — recommend defining font, headings, table styles, and reference format to ensure consistency. Examples in Guidance.md provide narrative style but not explicit formatting template.
