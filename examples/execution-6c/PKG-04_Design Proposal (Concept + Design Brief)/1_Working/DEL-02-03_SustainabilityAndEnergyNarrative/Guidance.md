## Purpose

This guidance document explains the rationale and principles underlying the Sustainability and Energy Narrative deliverable for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal response.

**Why this deliverable exists:**
- To demonstrate the Design-Build team's commitment to energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, and long-term operational value
- To address the RFP's requirement for "solar capable roofing" provisions (Addendum 03 — mandatory compliance requirement)
- To contribute to the Design Brief evaluation scoring (5 points per Decomposition §15)
- To support the Durability/Ease of Maintenance evaluation (15 points per Decomposition §15) by framing sustainability as life-cycle value
- To differentiate the proposal by showing understanding of life-cycle costs, operational priorities, and dual-function building operations (Fire Hall 24/7 + Public Works scheduled)

**Target audience:**
- Town of Penhold evaluation committee (municipal staff and decision-makers)
- Technical reviewers assessing code compliance and credibility
- Operational stakeholders concerned with long-term building performance, maintenance, and energy costs

**Downstream use:**
- Integrated into proposal Design Brief section (Section 7.1 of proposal response)
- Supports durability and ease of maintenance evaluation (15 points per Decomposition §15)
- Informs detailed design phase energy modeling and commissioning scope (if awarded)
- Provides baseline sustainability commitments for Owner review and approval during detailed design

## Principles

### Principle 1: Code Compliance as Baseline, Not Ceiling

**Rationale:**
Meeting the Alberta Building Code (ABC) and National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB) is the minimum acceptable performance. However, Design-Build proposals that demonstrate commitment to **exceeding** code minimums (where cost-effective and operationally beneficial) are more competitive and aligned with municipal sustainability goals.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Clearly state code compliance as the baseline (specific code editions and key requirements)
- Identify opportunities to exceed code (e.g., enhanced insulation, high-efficiency mechanical systems) **without** significantly increasing first cost or with strong payback
- Frame enhancements in terms of **operational savings** and **life-cycle value** to resonate with municipal budget priorities and evaluation criteria (Durability/Maintenance — 15 points)

**Example framing:**
> "The building envelope will meet NECB 2017 prescriptive requirements for Climate Zone 7A (roof R-35, walls R-24). We propose enhanced roof insulation (R-40) to reduce heat loss through the large roof area, with an estimated annual energy savings of $3,000-4,000 and a payback of approximately 7 years."

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (best practice for Design-Build proposals; municipal emphasis on long-term value per Decomposition §15 — 15 points for durability/maintenance)

---

### Principle 2: Solar-Ready is Strategic Optionality (Mandatory — Addendum 03)

**Rationale:**
Addendum 03 requires "solar capable roofing." This is not a requirement to **install** solar panels at construction, but to ensure the building can accommodate future solar installation without major retrofits. This provides the Town with strategic flexibility to add renewable energy generation when budget, incentives, or energy prices make it advantageous.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Emphasize **structural** provisions: roof framing designed for additional dead load (solar panels + mounting systems + snow load per Alberta loads)
- Emphasize **electrical** provisions: conduit rough-ins, panel capacity margin, disconnect space, inverter location considerations
- Emphasize **orientation**: roof geometry and pitch optimized for solar exposure (aligned with Concept Design DEL-02-01)
- Frame as **future-proofing** and **risk mitigation** (protects against future energy cost escalation; positions Town to take advantage of grants/incentives; avoids retrofit costs)

**Trade-off:**
- Solar-ready provisions add modest first cost (structural upgrades $10-15k, electrical rough-ins $5-10k; **ASSUMPTION** based on typical projects)
- But eliminate the much higher cost of **retrofit** if solar is desired later (structural reinforcement, electrical system overhaul, interior disruption — estimated $80-120k per industry benchmarks; **ASSUMPTION**)
- This trade-off strongly favors solar-ready design for new construction — emphasize this value proposition in narrative

**Critical note:**
- This is a **mandatory** Addendum 03 requirement; failure to comprehensively address solar-ready provisions (structural, electrical, orientation, access) is a compliance risk
- Use `Specification.md` REQ-003.1 through REQ-003.5 as a checklist; all must be addressed

### Principle 3: Dual-Function Building = Dual Energy Profiles

**Rationale:**
The Penhold PSB integrates a **Fire Hall** (24/7 occupancy, high thermal loads, emergency readiness) and **Public Works** facility (business hours, vehicle storage, seasonal peaks). These functions have fundamentally different energy profiles:

| Function | Occupancy | Thermal Loads | Energy Priorities |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Fire Hall** | 24/7 (living quarters, apparatus ready) | High (heated apparatus bays, domestic hot water, comfort for staff) | Reliability, comfort, emergency backup (generator) |
| **Public Works** | Business hours (typically 7am–5pm, Mon–Fri) | Moderate (offices, workshop, cold storage acceptable for vehicles) | Efficiency, setback/setup schedules, minimize off-hours consumption |

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Describe **zoning strategy**: separate HVAC zones for Fire Hall vs. Public Works to allow independent control and scheduling
- Describe **controls strategy**: 24/7 zones (Fire Hall living, apparatus ready) vs. scheduled zones (offices, workshops) managed by building automation system (BAS)
- Describe **load management**: generator supports ICP (Incident Command Post) and critical Fire Hall functions; Public Works can tolerate outages during off-hours
- Emphasize **operational flexibility**: Town can adjust zone schedules seasonally (e.g., extend Public Works hours during summer construction season) or as operational needs change

**Trade-off:**
- More complex HVAC zoning and controls add first cost (additional zone dampers, VAV boxes, BAS programming — estimated $15-25k; **ASSUMPTION**) and commissioning effort
- But result in **significant operational savings** by avoiding heating/cooling unoccupied spaces and allowing tailored comfort/setback schedules (estimated 30-40% energy reduction for Public Works zones vs. 24/7 operation; **ASSUMPTION** based on typical scheduling savings)
- This trade-off favors zoning for dual-function buildings with distinct occupancy patterns — emphasize operational savings and payback in narrative

**Operational Stewardship Consideration (per Lensing D-002):**
- BAS scheduling/seasonal adjustment capability assumes Town staff has operational maturity (staffing, training, monitoring) to manage proposed control complexity
- **TBD:** Confirm Town operational capacity before over-specifying BAS complexity; coordinate with DEL-06-01 (Commissioning) for training scope
- If Town operational maturity is limited, recommend simpler controls with essential scheduling only; avoid specifying capabilities that require continuous management attention

---

### Principle 4: High Bay Thermal Challenges Require Targeted Strategies (Mandatory — Addendum 03)

**Rationale:**
Apparatus bays with 16-ft overhead doors (Addendum 03) present significant thermal challenges in a heating-dominated climate:
- Large door area = high conductive and air leakage losses
- Frequent door operation (apparatus response) = infiltration losses
- High ceiling volume = stratification and heating inefficiency
- Cold floor (slab on grade) = occupant discomfort

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Describe **envelope strategy**: insulated sectional overhead doors with thermal breaks and weather seals (targeting R-10+ vs. typical R-6 uninsulated doors)
- Describe **destratification strategy**: ceiling fans or high-velocity air circulation to reduce stratification and improve comfort without overheating entire volume
- Describe **radiant heating option**: in-floor radiant or overhead radiant panels to provide comfort at occupied levels without heating full bay volume (particularly effective for high bay applications)
- Describe **vestibule or air curtain option** (if space allows): reduce infiltration during door operation (trade-off: space vs. energy savings)
- Describe **door operation protocol**: minimize door open time (operational practice, not design; mention in training/commissioning context per DEL-06-01)

**Trade-off:**
- High-performance overhead doors ($2-3k per door premium vs. standard; **ASSUMPTION**) and radiant heating (higher first cost than forced air) add first cost
- But reduce ongoing heating costs (estimated 20-30% reduction in bay heating energy vs. standard doors + forced air; **ASSUMPTION**) and improve occupant comfort (firefighter well-being and readiness)
- Radiant systems may have longer payback (10-15 years) but are valued for comfort and durability in high bay applications — frame as long-term value aligned with Durability/Maintenance evaluation (15 points)

**Priority Clarification (per Lensing B-004):**
- Radiant heating is presented above as "value for comfort/durability" but is listed in Trade-off 1 as "moderate-priority" with longer payback (10-15 years)
- **Resolution:** Radiant heating priority depends on narrative emphasis:
  - If emphasizing **durability/maintenance evaluation** (15 points): Elevate radiant heating as supporting evaluation criteria (comfort, reduced mechanical maintenance)
  - If emphasizing **cost-effectiveness/payback**: Position as moderate-priority enhancement with acknowledged longer payback
- Narrative author should select framing consistent with overall proposal strategy — avoid mixed messaging

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 — 16 ft overhead doors); ASSUMPTION (high bay thermal design best practices); Lensing B-004 (priority consistency)

### Principle 5: Fire Apparatus Exhaust Integration is an HVAC Design Driver (Mandatory — Addendum 03)

**Rationale:**
Fire apparatus exhaust systems (required per Addendum 03) capture vehicle exhaust at the tailpipe and vent it outside to protect firefighter health from diesel emissions. These systems interact with building HVAC in several ways:
- Exhaust fans create negative pressure (can interfere with HVAC air balance and pull conditioned air from adjacent spaces)
- Apparatus bays need make-up air to replace exhausted air (large volumes of outdoor air in heating season = significant energy penalty)
- Systems operate intermittently (apparatus start-up, warm-up, return from call) and must integrate with HVAC controls to avoid wasting energy

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Describe **integration strategy**: exhaust system interlocked with make-up air units to maintain pressure balance and avoid pulling conditioned air from Fire Hall living quarters or offices
- Describe **air quality strategy**: exhaust systems ensure diesel emissions are captured at source; HVAC provides adequate ventilation for general bay air quality per ASHRAE 62.1
- Describe **energy consideration**: make-up air should be tempered (heated or heat-recovered) to avoid introducing large volumes of cold outdoor air during heating season (untempered make-up air can negate envelope and HVAC efficiency gains)

**Trade-off:**
- Tempered make-up air adds equipment cost (heat recovery unit or tempering coil — estimated $10-20k; **ASSUMPTION**) and energy consumption
- But avoiding untempered outdoor air reduces heating load (estimated 40-60% reduction in make-up air heating penalty with heat recovery; **ASSUMPTION**) and maintains occupant comfort
- Heat recovery from exhaust air (if feasible — depends on exhaust air quality) can reduce energy penalty significantly — recommend heat recovery approach with payback framing

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 — fire apparatus exhaust required); ASSUMPTION (exhaust/HVAC integration best practices)

---

### Principle 6: Durability and Ease of Maintenance are Sustainability (Alignment with 15-Point Evaluation)

**Rationale:**
The RFP places significant evaluation weight on "Durability / Ease of Repair & Maintenance" (15 points per Decomposition §15 — highest single technical evaluation category). This aligns with a holistic view of sustainability: a building that lasts longer, requires less maintenance, and is easier to repair has a lower life-cycle environmental footprint than a building that requires frequent component replacement or intensive upkeep.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Describe **materials strategy**: durable, low-maintenance materials (e.g., metal roofing, cementitious siding, robust flooring) reduce replacement cycles and environmental impact — **coordinate with DEL-02-02** to avoid duplication; DEL-02-03 focuses on energy/operational implications, DEL-02-02 focuses on materials selection
- Describe **system accessibility**: HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems designed for easy access, filter changes, and component replacement (supports maintenance and reduces downtime)
- Describe **commissioning and training**: proper commissioning ensures systems perform as designed; training ensures Town staff can maintain systems effectively — **cross-reference DEL-06-01** for detailed commissioning approach
- Frame durability as an **environmental strategy** (reduces embodied energy of replacements) **and** an **operational strategy** (reduces life-cycle costs and service disruptions) — this framing directly supports the 15-point Durability/Maintenance evaluation

**Cross-reference coordination:**
- This principle should be reflected in both DEL-02-02 (Design Brief Narrative — durability section) and DEL-02-03 (Sustainability and Energy Narrative — life-cycle section)
- Ensure consistency and avoid duplication; DEL-02-02 focuses on **materials and construction durability**, DEL-02-03 focuses on **energy systems durability and operational sustainability**
- Use cross-references to connect narratives (e.g., in DEL-02-03: "As described in the Design Brief Narrative, durable materials reduce replacement cycles; similarly, durable HVAC systems with accessible components reduce maintenance costs and extend service life...")

**Source:** Decomposition §6 (OBJ-005 — demonstrate durability/ease of maintenance), §15 (Durability evaluation — 15 points); ASSUMPTION (holistic sustainability = durability + energy + maintenance)

---

### Principle 7: Water Efficiency Complements Energy Efficiency

**Rationale:**
While energy is the primary focus of this narrative, water efficiency is a related sustainability dimension. The site context (flood fringe, wetlands, stormwater management per Decomposition §4 and _REFERENCES.md) suggests water management is important to the project. Additionally, bay sumps are required per Addendum 03.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Describe **plumbing fixture efficiency**: low-flow fixtures reduce domestic hot water consumption (energy benefit through reduced DHW heating) and water use (environmental benefit)
- Describe **bay sump strategy** (required per Addendum 03): sump drainage for vehicle wash/maintenance areas; potential for oil/water separation and heat recovery from wastewater (if wash bay is included in Additional Option 1 per Decomposition §5)
- Describe **stormwater approach**: coordinate with site design (DEL-09-02) to show awareness of flood fringe and wetland constraints; frame stormwater management as part of holistic site sustainability — **avoid duplicating DEL-09-02**; use cross-reference instead

**Trade-off:**
- Enhanced plumbing fixtures (low-flow aerators, dual-flush toilets — minimal cost delta vs. standard) and wastewater heat recovery (if applicable — $5-10k for drain water heat recovery system; **ASSUMPTION**) add modest first cost
- But reduce water/sewer costs (estimated 20-30% water use reduction; **ASSUMPTION**) and demonstrate environmental stewardship
- Payback is longer than envelope or HVAC measures (15-20 years for drain water heat recovery), but supports overall sustainability narrative and demonstrates comprehensive approach — include but don't over-emphasize

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 — bay sumps, flood fringe), §5 (Additional Option 1 — built-in wash bay); _REFERENCES.md (Wetland Assessment, Flood Zone, Site Grading)

---

### Principle 8: Narrative Credibility Depends on Technical Specificity (Within Proposal Scope)

**Rationale:**
Generic sustainability narratives ("we will use energy-efficient systems") are not persuasive to evaluators. Credible narratives demonstrate understanding of:
- Specific technical strategies (e.g., "triple-glazed windows with low-E coatings" vs. "efficient windows")
- Code requirements and how the design meets or exceeds them (e.g., "NECB 2017 prescriptive envelope values for Climate Zone 7A" vs. "meets code")
- Trade-offs and design decisions (e.g., "radiant floor heating selected for apparatus bays due to comfort benefits and reduced stratification, despite higher first cost and longer payback")

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Use specific technical terms and strategies (appropriate for proposal/conceptual stage; not detailed design)
- Reference applicable codes and standards (ABC, NECB edition numbers and key sections) to demonstrate awareness and code-literacy
- Explain **why** strategies were chosen (not just **what** strategies) — this demonstrates design judgment and understanding of project context
- Acknowledge trade-offs where relevant (shows transparency and design rigor; evaluators respect candor about first cost vs. operational cost trade-offs)

**Caution:**
- Avoid over-specifying at proposal stage (equipment models, detailed calculations, final material selections are premature and limit Design-Build flexibility)
- Balance specificity with flexibility (Design-Build process involves refinement during detailed design)
- Use qualifiers like "anticipated," "conceptual," "targeting," "subject to detailed design and value engineering" where appropriate to maintain flexibility

**Example of appropriate specificity:**
> ✓ Good (proposal stage): "Apparatus bay overhead doors will be insulated sectional doors with thermal breaks, targeting minimum R-10 to minimize conductive losses"
> ✗ Too specific (limits flexibility): "Overhead doors will be Amarr Model 3552 with polyurethane insulation, R-value 18.4"
> ✗ Too generic (lacks credibility): "We will use efficient overhead doors"

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Climate Context — Central Alberta Heating-Dominated Design

**Factor:**
Penhold is in central Alberta (approximately 52.1°N, 113.9°W), which has a cold climate with long heating season and short cooling season. This is a **heating-dominated** design context (ASHRAE Climate Zone 7A; approximately 5,400 HDD base 18°C, 150 CDD base 18°C; **ASSUMPTION**).

**Implications for narrative:**
- **Prioritize heating efficiency strategies**: insulation (especially roof and overhead doors given large areas), air tightness, high-efficiency boilers/furnaces, heat recovery ventilation
- **Cooling efficiency is secondary**: may not need mechanical cooling for all spaces; natural ventilation and thermal mass may suffice for offices; apparatus bays typically not cooled
- **Snow load on roof affects solar-ready structural provisions**: heavier roof structure required to support PV panels + Alberta snow load (typically 2.4 kPa / 50 psf ground snow load in central Alberta; **ASSUMPTION** — verify with geotechnical or structural engineer)
- **Solar potential is good but seasonal**: long summer days and high-angle sun provide good solar energy capture; winter solar gain is limited (low sun angle, shorter days, snow accumulation on panels) — frame solar as annual energy offset, not winter heating offset

**Design priorities for narrative:**
1. Envelope thermal performance (reduce heat loss)
2. Mechanical system efficiency (heating emphasis)
3. Air tightness and heat recovery ventilation (reduce heating load)
4. Solar-ready provisions (for future summer energy offset)
5. Daylighting (reduce electric lighting; secondary thermal benefit)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (Penhold, Alberta location and climate characteristics); standard climate-responsive design practice

---

### Consideration 2: Generator Sizing and Fuel Type

**Factor:**
Addendum 03 requires a generator to support ICP (Incident Command Post). Generator sizing and fuel type affect energy and sustainability narrative.

**Implications for narrative:**
- **Sizing strategy**: Generator must support critical Fire Hall loads (ICP, apparatus bay doors for emergency response, life safety systems, minimal HVAC for occupied Fire Hall areas) — **not full building load** (oversized generators are inefficient and have higher capital/operating costs)
  - Estimate critical loads: ICP meeting room (lighting, HVAC, IT equipment), apparatus bay doors (motor loads), Fire Hall living quarters (minimal HVAC, lighting, DHW), emergency lighting, fire alarm — approximately 150-250 kW (**ASSUMPTION** based on typical fire hall critical loads; subject to detailed load analysis)
  - **IMPORTANT (per Lensing A-006):** The 150-250 kW assumption requires design input verification process. Generator sizing is safety-critical for fire hall emergency power. Narrative should reference load analysis methodology or note that detailed load analysis will be completed during detailed design. Do not commit to specific kW rating without engineering verification.
  - **Right-sizing reduces fuel consumption, maintenance, and capital cost** — emphasize this in narrative as both sustainability and value strategy

- **Fuel type options**:
  - **Diesel**: Most common for standby generators; reliable; higher emissions than natural gas; requires on-site fuel storage (tank); typical choice for fire halls due to reliability and independence from utility interruptions
  - **Natural gas**: Cleaner emissions; depends on natural gas service availability (utility connection); may be more expensive; vulnerable to gas service interruption (less common but possible)
  - **Propane**: Cleaner than diesel; flexible (on-site storage); less common for large generators
  - **Recommendation (narrative)**: **TBD** pending RFP OSR requirements and site utilities availability; if not specified, propose diesel (reliability for fire hall) with emissions tier specification (Tier 4 Final for lower emissions) — acknowledge natural gas as alternative if preferred by Town

- **Emissions tier** (if diesel): Specify Tier 4 Final (EPA emissions tier) for lower NOx and particulate emissions — demonstrates environmental consideration and aligns with sustainability narrative

- **Maintenance**: Generator requires regular testing and maintenance (monthly run tests, annual load bank testing, oil/filter changes) — tie to maintenance narrative (DEL-02-02) and commissioning/training (DEL-06-01)

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 — generator required to support ICP), §5 (ICP = Incident Command Post); ASSUMPTION (generator design considerations)

---

### Consideration 3: Solar-Ready Orientation and Roof Geometry Trade-offs

**Factor:**
Solar-ready roof design depends on building orientation and roof geometry, which are driven by multiple factors (site access, apparatus bay door orientation for emergency response, functional adjacencies, aesthetics). Solar optimization may conflict with operational or site constraints.

**Implications for narrative:**
- **Ideal orientation**: South-facing roof slope (northern hemisphere) maximizes annual solar energy capture; azimuth 180° (due south) is optimal
- **Roof pitch**: 15–30° pitch is optimal for Alberta latitude (approximately 52°N); pitch closer to latitude angle (52°) would be ideal but impractical (too steep); 15-25° (3:12 to 6:12) is good compromise for solar and snow shedding
- **Roof area**: Larger roof area = more solar potential; single-story design may provide more roof area than multi-story (relevant for apparatus bays and workshops, which are typically single-story)
- **Obstructions**: HVAC equipment, vents, skylights, and other roof penetrations reduce available solar roof area; plan for solar-dedicated zones (mark on roof plan)

**Trade-off:**
- Building orientation may be constrained by:
  - Site access and apparatus bay door orientation (typically front-facing toward street/response route for emergency response)
  - Parking layout and site circulation
  - Adjacent buildings or site features
  - Aesthetics and street presence
- **If optimal solar orientation conflicts with operational/site constraints**, acknowledge the trade-off and describe mitigation:
  - Example: "Building is oriented east-west due to apparatus bay door orientation toward [Street Name] for optimal emergency response access. The south-facing roof slope (on the long side of the building) provides good solar access. Additional roof area on the east-west axis compensates for non-optimal orientation, and the 4:12 roof pitch (18.4°) provides effective solar panel mounting angle for Alberta latitude."

**CONFLICT ALERT (per Lensing B-002 / CONF-001):**
- Datasheet marks "Solar Exposure" as TBD pending DEL-02-01 building orientation
- If Concept Design prioritizes apparatus bay door orientation over solar optimization, narrative **must** include mitigation strategy:
  - Additional roof area allocation for solar
  - Panel tilt optimization systems
  - Acceptance of reduced yield (quantified) with value proposition maintained
- **Authority:** DEL-02-01 Concept Design controls building orientation; Sustainability narrative must accommodate constraints — see Conflict Table CONF-001

**Coordination:**
- This consideration **must align with DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package)** — site plan and building massing/orientation
- **Flag if concept design orientation is suboptimal for solar** and describe compensating measures in narrative (additional roof area, panel tilt optimization, acceptance of slightly lower annual energy capture)
- Do not contradict DEL-02-01; if conflict exists, flag for resolution (see `Conflict Table` in this document)

**Source:** Decomposition §4 (Addendum 03 — "solar capable roofing"); ASSUMPTION (solar design best practices); Lensing B-002, CONF-001 (solar orientation coordination)

---

### Consideration 4: Proposal PDF Size Limit (15 MB) and Graphics Strategy

**Factor:**
Proposal must be a single PDF ≤15 MB (Decomposition §3, C-01). Graphics and images consume significant file size. Sustainability narrative competes with other proposal sections for file size budget.

**Implications for narrative:**
- Sustainability narrative **can** include diagrams or images (e.g., building envelope section, HVAC zoning diagram, solar-ready roof plan) **if** they enhance clarity and persuasiveness **and** file size budget allows
- But graphics must be **file-size optimized** (lower resolution, compressed, vector format preferred) to avoid exceeding 15 MB limit
- Prioritize graphics that communicate complex technical concepts efficiently (e.g., HVAC zoning diagram shows dual energy profiles better than text alone; solar-ready roof plan shows orientation and equipment zones clearly)
- Avoid decorative or redundant images (every image must add value to evaluation)

**Strategy:**
- **Coordinate with Proposal Manager (DEL-01-02 — PDF assembly)** to understand file size budget for this narrative section (e.g., "You have approximately 1.5-2 MB for sustainability narrative including any diagrams")
- **Propose 1-3 key diagrams (if beneficial)** and obtain approval before investing in graphic production:
  1. HVAC Zoning Diagram (floor plan showing Fire Hall 24/7 zones vs. Public Works scheduled zones) — supports Principle 3
  2. Solar-Ready Roof Plan (annotated roof plan showing solar-ready zones, access, orientation, HVAC equipment) — supports Principle 2 and REQ-003
  3. Building Envelope Section (schematic wall/roof section showing insulation, overhead door thermal strategy) — supports Principle 4 (optional; lower priority)
- **Use simple, schematic diagrams** (not photo-realistic renderings) to minimize file size — line drawings, simple colors, clear labels
- **Target <500 KB per diagram** (total contribution ~1-1.5 MB for 3 diagrams; leaves 0.5-1 MB for narrative text)

**Source:** Decomposition §3 (C-01 — PDF ≤15 MB); ASSUMPTION (graphics strategy for file size management)

---

### Consideration 5: Relationship to Other Deliverables (Avoid Duplication)

**Factor:**
Sustainability and energy content overlaps with other deliverables. Clear boundaries and coordination are essential to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.

**Deliverable boundaries:**
- **DEL-02-02 (Design Brief Narrative)**: Durability, maintenance, materials, construction detailing, operational workflow
- **DEL-02-03 (Sustainability and Energy Narrative — this deliverable)**: Energy systems, sustainability strategy, solar-ready provisions, life-cycle operational efficiency
- **DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package)**: Building orientation, massing, roof geometry, site layout (provides context for energy narrative)
- **DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions Summary)**: Stormwater, grading, wetlands, flood fringe (provides context for water efficiency narrative)
- **DEL-06-01 (Commissioning Narrative)**: Energy systems commissioning, functional performance testing (detailed commissioning procedures)

**Coordination approach:**
- **Avoid duplication**: Don't repeat content from other deliverables; use cross-references instead
  - Example (in DEL-02-03): "Materials durability and maintenance considerations are addressed in the Design Brief Narrative. From an energy perspective, durable HVAC systems with accessible components reduce maintenance downtime and extend service life, supporting long-term operational efficiency."
- **Ensure consistency**: Energy narrative must align with concept design (roof orientation), site approach (stormwater), materials strategy (durability), and commissioning plan (energy verification)
  - **Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Consistency Check)**: Explicitly verify alignment with DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-06-01, DEL-09-02
- **Flag conflicts**: If energy narrative implies a design decision (e.g., south-facing roof for solar optimization) that conflicts with concept design (e.g., east-west orientation for site access), **flag conflict in Conflict Table** (see below) and propose resolution or defer to authoritative deliverable (typically DEL-02-01 for building orientation)

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: First Cost vs. Operational Cost (Life-Cycle Value)

**The tension:**
Energy-efficient and sustainable design strategies typically increase first cost (construction budget) but reduce operational costs (energy, water, maintenance) over the building's life. Municipal owners must balance capital budget constraints with long-term value.

**Examples:**

| Strategy | First Cost Impact | Operational Cost Impact | Payback Period | Life-Cycle Value (20-yr NPV at 3% discount) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced insulation (roof R-40 vs. R-35) | +$20-40k | -$3-5k/yr energy savings | 5-10 years | **+$40-80k NPV** (positive) |
| High-efficiency condensing boiler (95% vs. 85% AFUE) | +$10-15k | -$2-3k/yr gas savings | 4-6 years | **+$25-40k NPV** (positive) |
| Solar-ready provisions (structural + electrical) | +$15-25k | $0 immediate (future solar installation saves $8-12k/yr if pursued) | Avoids $80-120k retrofit cost if solar added later | **+$100-150k NPV if solar added within 10 years** (strongly positive) |
| Triple-glazed windows (vs. double-glazed low-E) | +$30-50k | -$2-4k/yr energy savings | 10-15 years | **+$10-30k NPV** (marginal; value depends on comfort/condensation benefits) |
| Heat recovery ventilation (HRV/ERV) | +$15-25k | -$3-5k/yr heating savings | 5-8 years | **+$30-60k NPV** (positive) |
| Tempered make-up air for apparatus exhaust | +$10-20k | -$2-4k/yr heating savings | 5-10 years | **+$20-50k NPV** (positive) |

**Note:** Cost and savings estimates are **ASSUMPTIONS** based on typical projects of similar scope; subject to detailed design and value engineering. NPV calculations use 3% real discount rate (typical for municipal infrastructure) and 20-year analysis period.

**Decision framework for narrative:**
- **High-priority strategies** (emphasize in narrative):
  - Strong life-cycle value (payback <10 years, positive NPV >$30k)
  - Align with RFP priorities (durability, maintenance, solar-ready — Addendum 03 requirement)
  - Examples: Enhanced insulation, high-efficiency boiler, solar-ready provisions, HRV, tempered make-up air
- **Moderate-priority strategies** (include but don't over-emphasize):
  - Positive NPV but longer payback (10-15 years) or less alignment with RFP priorities
  - Examples: Triple-glazed windows (marginal NPV; emphasize comfort/condensation benefits if included)
- **Low-priority strategies** (mention briefly or omit):
  - Marginal NPV or unclear payback
  - Avoid overcommitting at proposal stage (Design-Build process allows value engineering during detailed design)

**Framing for proposal:**
- Municipal owners value life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) — frame energy strategies in terms of **operational savings** and **payback periods**
- But avoid detailed LCCA spreadsheets in proposal (not required; adds complexity and file size) — use **qualitative or summary quantitative statements**:
  - Example: "Enhanced envelope insulation (roof R-40 vs. code minimum R-35) is anticipated to reduce annual heating costs by 15-20% with a payback of approximately 7 years and a 20-year net present value of $50,000-70,000."
- Emphasize alignment with Durability/Maintenance evaluation (15 points) — life-cycle value demonstrates long-term thinking

**Life-Cycle Analysis Clarifications (per Lensing B-006, C-006, D-005):**
- **Building service life assumption:** NPV calculations in this guidance use 20-year analysis period, but building service life is not confirmed (could be 25, 40, or indefinite years for municipal facility). Different service life yields different NPV results. Narrative should state assumed analysis period explicitly.
- **LCCA evidence level:** Proposal stage requires qualitative framing with illustrative NPV/payback estimates (as shown above). Detailed LCCA spreadsheets are not required and should not be included.
- **Peer review qualification:** If including LCCA claims, ensure peer reviewer (Procedure Step 7) has qualifications to validate cost assumptions and methodology. Generic architectural peer review may not assess LCCA credibility.
- **RFP evaluation confirmation (per Lensing E-003):** Guidance emphasizes LCCA as persuasive to municipal owners, but RFP Section 9 rubric may prioritize other factors (code compliance, solar-ready, durability). Confirm LCCA emphasis aligns with actual evaluation criteria before over-investing in life-cycle narrative content.

### Trade-off 2: Specificity vs. Flexibility (Design-Build Process)

**The tension:**
Proposal must be **specific enough** to demonstrate credibility and technical understanding, but **flexible enough** to allow refinement during the Design-Build detailed design phase.

**Implications for narrative:**
- **Over-specification risk**: Committing to specific equipment models, exact R-values, or detailed strategies at proposal stage limits design flexibility and may increase cost risk if specified systems become unavailable, more expensive, or suboptimal during detailed design
- **Under-specification risk**: Generic statements ("we will use efficient systems") lack credibility and don't differentiate the proposal

**Strategy:**
- Use **performance targets** and **conceptual strategies** rather than final specifications:
  - ✓ Good: "Apparatus bay overhead doors will be insulated sectional doors with thermal breaks, targeting minimum R-10 to minimize conductive losses"
  - ✗ Over-specified: "Overhead doors will be Amarr Model 3552, 16' x 14', with 2" polyurethane insulation, R-value 18.4, in color 'Bronze'"
  - ✗ Under-specified: "We will use efficient overhead doors"
- Use **qualifiers**: "anticipated," "conceptual," "targeting," "subject to detailed design and value engineering," "representative strategy"
- Describe **design intent** and **criteria** that will guide detailed design:
  - Example: "HVAC system will be sized and zoned to provide independent control of Fire Hall and Public Works areas, allowing optimized scheduling and setback strategies. System type (rooftop units vs. central plant) and distribution (VAV vs. constant volume) will be finalized during detailed design based on loads analysis and value engineering."

### Trade-off 3: Sustainability Narrative Depth vs. Proposal Length/Size

**The tension:**
Comprehensive sustainability narrative (covering envelope, mechanical, electrical, water, materials, commissioning, solar-ready provisions in detail) could be 8-12 pages with diagrams. But proposal must fit within 15 MB PDF and evaluators have limited reading time. Conciseness and focus are valued.

**Implications for narrative:**
- Prioritize **breadth of coverage** (touch on all key topics) over **depth** (exhaustive detail on one topic)
- Use **concise, structured writing**: bullet points, tables, subheadings to make content scannable and evaluator-friendly
- Focus on **differentiators** and **RFP priorities**:
  - Solar-ready provisions (Addendum 03 requirement — mandatory and differentiator)
  - Durability/maintenance (15-point evaluation — highest technical category)
  - Dual-function zoning (demonstrates understanding of operational reality and credibility)
- Use **cross-references** to avoid repeating content from other sections:
  - Example: "Materials strategy is detailed in Design Brief Narrative; energy implications of durable materials are summarized here..."

**Target length (recommended):**
- **4-6 pages of narrative text** (approximately 2,000-3,000 words)
- **1-2 diagrams/tables** (if beneficial and file size permits; <500 KB each)
- **Total contribution to 15 MB PDF**: approximately 1-2 MB (assumes other sections are also substantial and file size budget is shared)

## Examples

### Example 1: Solar-Ready Provisions Narrative Excerpt (Illustrative)

> **Solar-Ready Roof Design**
>
> The Public Services Building roof is designed to accommodate future photovoltaic (PV) solar panel installation without structural modifications or major electrical upgrades. This "solar-ready" approach, as required by Addendum 03, provides the Town with strategic flexibility to add renewable energy generation when budget, incentive programs, or energy economics make solar installation advantageous.
>
> **Structural Provisions:**
> - Roof framing (steel joists or engineered wood trusses) is designed for an additional dead load of 5 psf (0.24 kPa) to accommodate solar panels, mounting systems, and accumulated snow (Alberta snow load + panel load per NBC 2020).
> - Structural drawings will clearly mark "solar-ready zones" on the roof plan for future installer reference, indicating areas free of obstructions and designed for PV mounting.
>
> **Electrical Provisions:**
> - Main electrical service and distribution panel are sized with 20% spare capacity to accommodate a future solar inverter and PV circuits (anticipated system size: 50-100 kW based on available roof area; subject to detailed design).
> - Conduit rough-in (2" conduit, capped and labeled "PV Ready") is provided from designated roof solar zones to the main electrical room, allowing future PV wiring without interior penetrations or disruption.
> - Dedicated disconnect switch space and inverter mounting location (approximately 4' x 3' wall space) are reserved in the electrical room, adjacent to the main distribution panel.
>
> **Roof Geometry and Orientation:**
> - Building is oriented with primary roof slope facing south (azimuth 180°), which is optimal for solar energy capture at Penhold latitude (52.1°N). [**Note**: Verify orientation with DEL-02-01 Concept Design; adjust narrative if building orientation differs due to site constraints.]
> - Roof pitch is 4:12 (18.4° slope), which provides a good solar panel mounting angle for Alberta latitude and sheds snow effectively. Alternative panel tilt systems can be used if flatter pitch is selected.
> - HVAC equipment, roof vents, and other penetrations are located on the north-facing slope or in designated equipment zones to preserve south-facing roof area for the future solar array (estimated available solar roof area: 3,000-5,000 sq ft / 280-460 m²).
>
> **Future Value and Retrofit Cost Avoidance:**
> - Solar-ready provisions add approximately $20,000-25,000 to first cost (structural upgrades and electrical rough-ins).
> - This investment avoids an estimated $80,000-$120,000 in retrofit costs if solar is added later, which would require structural reinforcement, electrical system overhaul, roof membrane removal, and interior disruption.
> - If solar is installed in the future (pending Town decision based on budget, incentives, and energy economics), a 75 kW system is anticipated to reduce annual electricity costs by approximately $8,000-$12,000 (based on current Alberta electricity rates of $0.10-$0.15/kWh), with a payback of 8-12 years including available federal and provincial solar incentives.
> - Solar-ready design provides the Town with strategic optionality and protects against future energy cost escalation.

**Why this example works:**
- Addresses all REQ-003 requirements (structural, electrical, orientation, access, value framing)
- Uses specific technical details (5 psf load, 2" conduit, 4:12 pitch, 20% spare capacity) to demonstrate credibility
- Explains the "why" (strategic flexibility, retrofit cost avoidance, future value)
- Acknowledges first cost and frames future value with estimated savings and payback
- Appropriate for proposal stage (conceptual; performance targets; not final specifications)
- Includes coordination note to verify orientation with DEL-02-01 (demonstrates awareness of cross-deliverable dependencies)

### Example 2: Dual-Function Building Zoning Narrative Excerpt (Illustrative)

> **Energy Zoning for Dual-Function Operations**
>
> The integrated Fire Hall and Public Works facility presents distinct operational and thermal profiles. The Fire Hall requires 24/7 heating, cooling, and ventilation for living quarters and apparatus readiness, while the Public Works offices and workshop operate primarily during business hours (7am–5pm, Mon–Fri). To optimize energy efficiency and operational flexibility, the HVAC system is designed with independent zones:
>
> **Fire Hall Zones (24/7 operation):**
> - **Living quarters** (bunkrooms, kitchen, dayroom): Constant temperature (21-22°C / 70-72°F) and ventilation; comfort priority for firefighter well-being and readiness.
> - **Apparatus bays**: Heated to 15-18°C (60-65°F) for apparatus readiness and freeze protection; destratification fans to reduce stratification losses; exhaust system integrated with tempered make-up air to minimize energy penalty.
> - **Fire administration offices**: Heated/cooled during occupied hours (daytime); slight setback during night shifts (18°C / 65°F) to reduce energy consumption while maintaining readiness.
>
> **Public Works Zones (scheduled operation):**
> - **Offices**: Heated/cooled during business hours (7am–5pm, Mon–Fri); setback to 13°C (55°F) nights and weekends to minimize off-hours energy consumption.
> - **Workshop**: Heated during business hours; minimal setback to 10°C (50°F) off-hours (cold storage acceptable for equipment; freeze protection only).
> - **Vehicle storage** (cold storage bays): Unheated (freeze protection only for plumbing if present); no conditioning required.
>
> **Energy Savings:**
> - Independent zoning allows Public Works areas to operate on aggressive setback schedules, reducing heating energy consumption by an estimated 30-40% for those zones compared to 24/7 operation (based on typical scheduling savings for office/workshop spaces).
> - Fire Hall zones maintain comfort and readiness without penalty from Public Works heating cycles, ensuring operational reliability.
> - Building automation system (BAS) provides zone scheduling, monitoring, and seasonal adjustment capability, allowing the Town to optimize energy use as operational patterns evolve.
>
> **Operational Flexibility:**
> - Town can adjust zone schedules seasonally (e.g., extend Public Works hours during summer construction season or winter snow clearing operations) without affecting Fire Hall operations.
> - BAS provides energy consumption reporting by zone to support operational decision-making, budgeting, and identification of efficiency opportunities.

**Why this example works:**
- Demonstrates understanding of dual-function building operational reality (Principle 3)
- Uses specific strategies (zone definitions, setback temperatures, BAS controls) to show technical credibility
- Quantifies energy savings (30-40% reduction for Public Works zones) with caveat ("estimated" — appropriate for proposal stage)
- Highlights operational flexibility (aligns with RFP adaptability emphasis per Decomposition §9, SOW-014)
- Appropriate level of detail for proposal (conceptual zoning strategy; not detailed controls programming)

### Example 3: Code Compliance Statement (Illustrative)

> **Energy Code Compliance and Performance Targets**
>
> The Public Services Building is designed to meet or exceed the National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB 2017, as adopted by Alberta Building Code). Our approach:
>
> **Baseline Compliance (NECB 2017 Prescriptive Path — Climate Zone 7A):**
> - **Building envelope**: Minimum effective R-values per NECB Table 3.2.1.2:
>   - Roof: R-35 (RSI 6.2)
>   - Above-grade walls: R-24 (RSI 4.2)
>   - Below-grade walls: R-17 (RSI 3.0)
>   - Slab-on-grade: R-12 (RSI 2.1) perimeter insulation
>   - Windows: U-1.60 (USI 2.9) maximum; double-glazed low-E with argon fill
> - **Mechanical systems**: Minimum efficiency per NECB Section 5:
>   - Heating: Condensing boiler ≥90% AFUE or furnace ≥95% AFUE (natural gas)
>   - Ventilation: Heat recovery ventilation (HRV) with ≥60% sensible effectiveness
>   - Cooling (if required): Air conditioning ≥13 SEER / 11.2 EER
> - **Lighting**: LED lighting throughout; maximum 10 W/m² for general areas per NECB Section 4.2
>
> **Performance Enhancements (Cost-Effective Measures):**
> - **Enhanced roof insulation**: R-40 (RSI 7.0) to reduce heat loss through large roof area (estimated 15,000-20,000 sq ft roof); enhanced insulation adds approximately $25,000 first cost with annual energy savings of $3,000-4,000 (payback ~7 years).
> - **High-performance overhead doors**: Insulated sectional doors with thermal breaks, targeting R-10+ (significantly exceeds typical R-6 uninsulated doors), to minimize conductive losses and air leakage from 16-ft apparatus bay doors.
> - **LED lighting**: Exceeds NECB baseline (targeting 8 W/m² or less for general areas); reduces electrical load and cooling load; supports daylighting strategy where feasible.
>
> **Anticipated Performance:**
> - **Energy Use Intensity (EUI)**: Targeting ≤250 kWh/m²/yr (heating-dominated municipal facility; typical range for similar buildings in Alberta is 250-350 kWh/m²/yr).
> - **Estimated performance**: 15-20% better than NECB 2017 baseline due to enhanced envelope, high-efficiency mechanical systems, and optimized zoning/controls.
>
> **Verification:**
> - Energy model will be completed during detailed design to confirm performance targets and optimize system sizing.
> - Commissioning (see Commissioning Narrative) will verify systems operate as designed and meet performance targets.
> - Post-occupancy energy monitoring (first 12 months) will verify actual performance and identify optimization opportunities.

**Why this example works:**
- Clearly states code compliance baseline (REQ-001.2 — code-aware)
- Uses specific code references (NECB 2017, Table 3.2.1.2, Climate Zone 7A) to demonstrate credibility and code-literacy
- Identifies performance enhancements with rationale (cost-effective, large roof area, overhead door thermal challenges)
- Provides performance target (EUI ≤250 kWh/m²/yr) with context (typical for building type and climate)
- Acknowledges verification approach (energy model, commissioning, post-occupancy monitoring) without over-committing to final numbers at proposal stage
- Appropriate level of detail for proposal (baseline + enhancements + targets; not detailed calculations)
