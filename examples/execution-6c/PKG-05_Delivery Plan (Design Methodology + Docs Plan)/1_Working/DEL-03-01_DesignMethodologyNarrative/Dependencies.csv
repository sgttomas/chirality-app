Procedure.md Step 2.4 instructs author to coordinate with Construction Methodology to ensure consistency in terminology assumptions and sequencing. Procedure.md Step 4 item 1 confirms consistency check with DEL-04-01. Source RFP Section 7.1 page 16.

The interface is bidirectional — DEL-03-01 content informs and must be consistent with DEL-05-03. Confidence MEDIUM because the directional primacy is an interface rather than a strict unidirectional handover.
