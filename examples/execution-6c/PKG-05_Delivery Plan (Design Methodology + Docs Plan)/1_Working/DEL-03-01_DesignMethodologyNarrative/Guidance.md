# Guidance: DEL-03-01 Design Methodology Narrative

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists

The Design Methodology Narrative serves multiple critical functions in the Design-Build proposal response:

1. **Demonstrates process competence** — Shows the Evaluation Committee that the Design-Builder has a clear, structured approach to delivering design from concept through construction documentation — Source: RFP Section 4.1 (Evaluation Committee may not be completely knowledgeable in all aspects; need clear, concise, comprehensive presentation), page 12

2. **Establishes working relationship framework** — Sets expectations for how Design-Builder will collaborate with Owner, Project Committee, and Project Manager throughout the design phases — Source: RFP Section 7.1 requirement for collaborative approach, page 16

3. **Differentiates proposal through innovation** — Provides opportunity to demonstrate innovative process approaches that add value or reduce risk — Source: RFP Section 8.3 scoring (100% "Exceptional" requires innovation), page 27

4. **Manages evaluation risk** — Worth 3 points out of 100 total; necessary but not the highest-weighted item (Proposed Conceptual Design = 20 points, Proposal Price = 35 points) — Source: RFP Section 8.3, page 26

5. **Bridges concept and execution** — Connects the Proposed Conceptual Design (DEL-02-01) with the detailed design plan (DEL-03-02) and construction methodology (DEL-04-01) — Source: ASSUMPTION based on deliverable relationships in Decomposition

**Owner value priority context:** The evaluation rationale for this deliverable should be grounded in Owner's stated value priorities (RFP Section 2.2): best value, practical solutions, reduced facility costs over extended period. The methodology should demonstrate how these value priorities are served by the proposed design process.

*[Semantic Lensing C-007: Owner value priority context added per C:evaluative:necessity lens]*

**Effort-to-weight ratio note:** This deliverable represents 3 of 100 evaluation points but is specified by 30 requirements (Specification.md), 8 principles, 10 considerations, 6 trade-offs (Guidance.md), and 8 procedure steps (Procedure.md). The methodology narrative should be sized appropriately to the 3-point weight while still demonstrating competence. Over-engineering the methodology relative to its evaluation weight may not yield proportional score improvement.

*[Semantic Lensing E-006: Effort-to-weight ratio noted per E:evaluative:necessity lens]*

### Downstream Use

**During proposal evaluation:**
- Evaluated by Evaluation Committee as part of Project Delivery Plan scoring (3 of 10 points) — Source: RFP Section 8.1, page 25
- May trigger clarification questions from Evaluation Committee — Source: RFP Section 8.4, page 28

**Clarification question feedback mechanism:** The methodology does not currently describe how Evaluation Committee clarification questions (RFP Section 8.4, page 28) would be handled or how responses might inform methodology refinement. This is an evaluation-phase process and may not need to be addressed in the methodology narrative itself, but the Design-Builder should be prepared to respond to clarification questions about the methodology.

*[Semantic Lensing E-003: Clarification question feedback mechanism noted per E:operative:necessity lens]*

**If proposal is successful:**
- Becomes part of Contract Documents (hierarchy: after Agreement, Definitions, General Conditions, OSR, Construction Documents, but before Request for Proposal) — Source: Appendix J SC6 (document priority), page 65
- Establishes baseline expectations for design process execution
- Referenced during design phase for process disputes or clarifications

## Principles

### Principle Hierarchy Note

The eight principles below (P-01 through P-08) provide guidance for the design methodology. If principles conflict during implementation (e.g., P-03 schedule flexibility vs. P-05 coordination requiring more time), the following priority order is suggested:

1. **P-01: Design-Build Integration** — Foundational to the delivery model
2. **P-07: Design-Builder Retains Design Responsibility** — Critical contractual constraint
3. **P-06: Professional Accountability** — Regulatory requirement
4. **P-02: Owner Collaboration** — RFP-mandated approach
5. **P-04: Compliance as Threshold** — Minimum compliance is non-negotiable
6. **P-05: Multi-Disciplinary Coordination** — Essential for quality
7. **P-08: Permitting as Constraint** — Regulatory interface
8. **P-03: Schedule Flexibility as Value Lever** — Value optimization (lower priority than compliance)

*[Semantic Lensing B-008: Principle hierarchy added per B:wisdom:necessity lens for conflict resolution guidance]*

### P-01: Design-Build Integration (Fundamental)

**Principle:** Design and construction are integrated activities under Design-Build delivery; design methodology must reflect single-point responsibility and eliminate adversarial relationships typical of traditional design-bid-build.

**Rationale:**
- CCDC 14-2013 is specifically structured for Design-Build delivery where Design-Builder is responsible for both design and construction — Source: RFP Section 5.4, page 15
- Design-Builder definition: "responsible for the delivery of Design and Construction Services" — Source: RFP Section 1 Definitions, page 6
- Integration enables constructability review, value engineering, and risk reduction during design phases

**Implication for methodology:**
- Constructability should be integrated at each design milestone, not deferred to post-IFC
- Cost implications of design decisions should be evaluated continuously
- Subcontractor input should be solicited during design (e.g., structural system selection, building envelope details)

---

### P-02: Owner Collaboration Over Designer Autonomy

**Principle:** The methodology must emphasize collaboration and transparency with the Owner, not designer autonomy or "trust us" posturing.

**Rationale:**
- RFP explicitly requires description of "how they will work with Stakeholders and the Project Team" and "plan to facilitate a collaborative approach" — Source: RFP Section 7.1, page 16
- Owner has defined a Project Committee (3 named individuals) who will be actively engaged — Source: RFP Section 1 Definitions, page 6
- Multiple review and approval gates are specified (5 design milestones) — Source: RFP Section 7.1.8, page 18
- Owner retains Owner's Advisor with authority to interpret OSR and make findings — Source: Appendix J SC13, page 64

**Implication for methodology:**
- Regular touchpoints with Owner/Project Committee throughout design phases
- Transparent decision-making with Owner input/approval at key junctures
- Proactive communication of issues, alternatives, and recommendations
- Clear documentation of Owner decisions and direction

**Governance model gap:** Principles P-02 and P-05 describe collaboration and coordination goals but do not define a governance model (e.g., decision rights matrix, escalation path, authority levels) that operationalizes these principles. The methodology should consider including:
- RACI matrix for design decisions (who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
- Decision authority thresholds (which decisions require Owner approval vs. Design-Builder authority)
- Escalation path for unresolved issues

*[Semantic Lensing A-006, D-003: Governance model gap identified per A:operative:guiding and D:operative:guiding lenses]*

---

### P-03: Schedule Flexibility as Value Lever

**Principle:** Because the project is NOT schedule-driven, the design methodology should explicitly leverage schedule flexibility to reduce capital costs or increase value.

**Rationale:**
- Owner emphasizes: "this project is NOT schedule driven. Proponents are strongly encouraged to leverage the Owner's schedule flexibility to the extent it reduces capital costs or increases value." — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 8
- Owner expects Design-Builder to propose schedule that is "most cost effective and suitable to the Design Builder" — Source: RFP Appendix A Section 10.2.3, page 37
- Evaluation criteria emphasize "efficiency, innovation, and value for money" — Source: RFP Section 4.3, page 12

**Implication for methodology:**
- Design sequencing can be optimized for procurement lead times (e.g., early release of long-lead structural steel or mechanical equipment packages)
- Value engineering can be conducted without schedule pressure
- Permitting can be sequenced to allow early-start construction (e.g., Foundation IFC while building design is finalized)
- Material selection can favor cost-effectiveness over expedited delivery

**Example applications:**
- Early engagement with manufacturers for cost-effective equipment selection
- Phased permitting to enable foundation start while finalizing building design
- Extended design development phase to optimize system selections

**Value quantification gap:** While P-03 articulates the principle and provides example applications, it does not quantify or illustrate what "value" means in concrete terms for this specific project. Consider adding:
- Estimated cost savings from extended design phase (if quantifiable)
- Specific value-add opportunities enabled by schedule flexibility (e.g., off-peak material procurement, extended VE analysis)
- Benchmarks from similar municipal Design-Build projects

*[Semantic Lensing A-009, D-006: Value quantification gap identified per A:evaluative:guiding and D:evaluative:guiding lenses]*

---

### P-04: Compliance as Threshold, Value as Differentiator

**Principle:** Meeting RFP requirements is the minimum threshold; methodology must demonstrate how the design process enables value delivery beyond mere compliance.

**Rationale:**
- RFP states proposals "should prioritize comprehensive solutions that optimize the use of resources while meeting our project goals. Emphasis will be placed on efficiency, innovation, and value for money." — Source: RFP Section 4.3, page 12
- Scoring matrix rewards innovation (100% = "adds a level of innovation") — Source: RFP Section 8.3, page 27
- Owner's background states: "Offers the best value and practical solution for the requested requirements" and "Embracing modern building materials and techniques allows the Town to benefit from reduced facility costs over an extended period" — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 8

**Implication for methodology:**
- Process must enable value engineering and cost optimization
- Methodology should identify opportunities for innovation (materials, systems, processes)
- Life-cycle cost considerations should be integrated, not just first-cost optimization

**Prescriptive authority cross-reference:** The compliance baseline for this deliverable is consolidated in Specification.md Standards table. Key prescriptive authorities include:
- CCDC 14-2013 (contract standard)
- Alberta Building Code / NBCC (building code)
- RFP Section 7.1 (methodology requirements)
- Professional seal requirements (Alberta legislation)

*[Semantic Lensing A-001: Prescriptive authority list cross-linked to Specification.md per A:normative:guiding lens]*

---

### P-05: Multi-Disciplinary Coordination as Core Competency

**Principle:** Coordination across architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, and specialty disciplines is not an ancillary task — it is central to design quality and must be built into the methodology from the start.

**Rationale:**
- RFP requires "complete set, fully coordinated both between drawings and specifications and between architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical and other disciplines" — Source: Appendix J SC8, page 64
- Design Brief requires all disciplines to be addressed (architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical) — Source: RFP Section 7.1.2, pages 16-17
- Failure of coordination leads to RFIs, change orders, and cost/schedule impacts during construction

**Implication for methodology:**
- Regular interdisciplinary coordination meetings/reviews at each design phase
- Use of coordination tools (clash detection, overlay reviews, BIM coordination if applicable)
- Clear responsibility matrix for discipline leaders and coordination points
- Coordination checklists or protocols to ensure nothing is missed

---

### P-06: Professional Accountability and Seal Requirements

**Principle:** All design documents require professional seal by Architect/Engineer registered in Alberta; methodology must ensure this is not a rubber-stamp but a meaningful professional review.

**Rationale:**
- "A professional Architect/Engineer, registered to practice in Alberta must seal all planning, design, and construction documents, including reports and change documents requiring professional design services." — Source: RFP Section 7.2, page 20
- Sealing carries professional liability; engineer of record must have adequate review and involvement
- Owner relies on professional seal as assurance of code compliance and design adequacy

**Implication for methodology:**
- Principal engineers/architects must be engaged at key design milestones, not just at document issuance
- QC process must include professional review before seal application
- Change documents must flow through professional review if they affect sealed design
- Consultant site inspections (monthly for Architect, per schedule for others) ensure ongoing professional oversight — Source: RFP Section 7.3, page 21

---

### P-07: Design-Builder Retains Full Design Responsibility Despite Owner Reviews

**Principle:** Owner review and acceptance of design submissions does NOT transfer design responsibility to the Owner; Design-Builder remains solely liable for design compliance with OSR and Contract requirements.

**Rationale:**
- "Nothing in the Contract, including any review or acceptance or opportunity to review or accept the design, shall make the Owner or the Owner's Advisor responsible for the design of the Work... the Design-Builder shall, notwithstanding any review or acceptance... remain solely liable and responsible for compliance" — Source: Appendix J SC14 (paragraph 2.5.3), page 65

**Implication for methodology:**
- Design-Builder must maintain internal QC and cannot rely on Owner review as substitute
- Owner's comments or acceptance do not relieve Design-Builder of obligation to meet OSR
- Design-Builder should document that reviews are for Owner information/input, not design verification
- Professional liability insurance and internal QC become even more critical

**Governance framework needed:** This principle requires an adequate governance framework to operationalize it. The methodology should describe:
- Internal QC review gates before Owner submission
- Documented QC sign-offs (professional review before professional seal)
- Design basis records that demonstrate Design-Builder accountability

*[Semantic Lensing X-002: Governance framework need identified per X:guiding:sufficiency lens]*

---

### P-08: Permitting as Design Constraint, Not Afterthought

**Principle:** Municipal permitting requirements and AHJ compliance must be integrated into design methodology from the start, not treated as a post-design submission task.

**Rationale:**
- "Conformity to all required building codes and requirements of AHJ is the responsibility of the Design-Builder" — Source: RFP Section 7.2, page 19
- "The Design-Builder will oversee, manage, and pay for all costs associated with all required permits and inspections... as well as all directed re-work and subsequent inspection costs" — Source: RFP Section 7.2, page 19
- Failure to anticipate AHJ requirements can lead to costly re-design

**Implication for methodology:**
- Early engagement with AHJ (Town of Penhold building/planning departments) to clarify interpretation of codes
- Code compliance review at each design milestone, not just at IFC
- Permitting strategy that sequences submissions to enable early construction start if beneficial
- Contingency for AHJ comments and re-work cycles

---

## Considerations

### C-01: Scope Interpretation and Clarification Management

**Consideration:** The RFP and OSR provide extensive requirements, but also acknowledge flexibility (e.g., "Owner is open to alternative configurations" per Section 10.3.4, page 39). How will the Design-Builder balance innovation with Owner expectations?

**Factors to weigh:**
- Addendum 01 confirms functional program "intentionally omits many room dimensions to allow innovation; spaces must at minimum meet building code" — Source: Decomposition Section 4
- BUT, Owner has specific operational requirements (equipment dimensions, locker counts, etc.) that constrain design — Source: RFP Appendix B (Functional Program), pages 46-48
- Unclear Owner preferences should be clarified early in design process to avoid late-stage re-work

**Methodology implications:**
- Initial OSR review should identify ambiguities and generate clarification questions
- Design Development phase should present options for Owner selection where flexibility exists
- Document Owner decisions to establish baseline for change management

---

### C-02: Design Milestone Sizing and Owner Review Capacity

**Consideration:** RFP specifies five design milestones with "time for review and resubmission" (Section 7.1.8, page 18), but does not specify Owner review duration. How should methodology size review periods?

**Factors to weigh:**
- Owner is a small municipality (Town of Penhold, ~4,000 residents) — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 7
- Project Committee has 3 individuals with operational roles (Protective Services Manager, Operations Manager, CAO) who have other duties — Source: RFP Section 1, page 6
- Owner may retain Owner's Advisor for technical review, but this is not confirmed — Source: Appendix J SC13, page 64
- Inadequate review time can lead to incomplete Owner input and later changes
- Excessive review time increases overall schedule and may reduce value

**Methodology implications:**
- **ASSUMPTION:** 10-15 business days for Owner review at Design Development and 60% milestones may be reasonable
- **ASSUMPTION:** 5-10 business days for Foundation IFC and 100% reviews (more focused scope)
- Methodology should propose review durations and offer to adjust based on Owner capacity
- Resubmission time should be planned (address Owner comments before next milestone)

---

### C-03: Geotechnical Sufficiency and Additional Investigation Risk

**Consideration:** Design-Builder is responsible for reviewing geotechnical report (Appendix D) and determining if additional investigation is needed. If additional work is required, it must be "clearly stated and costed accordingly in their proposal" (Section 7.3.4, page 22).

**Factors to weigh:**
- Geotechnical report is provided (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., February 12, 2021, File No. USG1123) — Source: RFP page 50 (embedded cover)
- Site grading has been completed by Owner — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 8
- If Design-Builder underestimates investigation needs, additional costs are at Design-Builder's risk
- If Design-Builder overestimates, proposal may be less competitive on price

**Methodology implications:**
- Initial geotechnical review should occur during proposal development (pre-award), but detailed foundation design occurs post-award
- Methodology should describe geotechnical review process and decision criteria for additional investigation
- **TBD:** Whether additional geotechnical work is anticipated (cannot be determined without detailed structural concept and soil data review)

---

### C-04: Coordination with Construction Methodology

**Consideration:** Design Methodology (DEL-03-01) and Construction Methodology (DEL-04-01) are evaluated separately (3 points each), but are deeply interconnected in Design-Build delivery.

**Factors to weigh:**
- Design decisions (e.g., structural system selection, building envelope assembly) directly impact construction sequencing, safety, and logistics
- Construction constraints (e.g., site access, crane placement, winter construction) should inform design decisions
- Inconsistency between design and construction narratives will be apparent to Evaluation Committee

**Methodology implications:**
- Design Methodology should reference integration with construction planning
- Constructability reviews should be built into design milestones
- Subcontractor/specialty contractor input should be solicited during design for high-risk or specialized systems
- **Cross-deliverable consistency:** Terminology, assumptions, and sequencing must align between DEL-03-01 and DEL-04-01

---

### C-05: Shop Drawing Review Process Load

**Consideration:** RFP requires Design-Builder to "review shop drawings, samples, and other submittals from the subcontractors to ensure they comply with the intent of the approved working drawings and specifications" (Section 7.3, page 20). This can be a significant effort if not properly planned.

**Factors to weigh:**
- Shop drawing volume is proportional to design specificity and product selection approach (performance specs generate more submittals than prescriptive specs)
- Review bottlenecks can delay construction and impact critical path
- Consultant involvement in shop drawing review adds cost but improves quality — Source: Appendix J SC27 requires Consultant and Other Consultants review, page 67

**Methodology implications:**
- Design approach should balance performance vs. prescriptive specifications based on risk and Owner preference
- Submittal schedule and review durations should be planned during design phases
- Consultant involvement in shop drawing review should be scoped and budgeted
- Early identification of long-lead or high-submittal-volume items (e.g., mechanical equipment, overhead doors, fire apparatus exhaust systems)

---

### C-06: As-Built Drawing Maintenance Strategy

**Consideration:** Design-Builder must prepare and maintain as-built drawings as Work progresses, and deliver final as-built and record drawings in hard-copy and electronic format (including CAD files) at project completion (Appendix J SC28, page 67). This is often a source of disputes if not planned.

**Factors to weigh:**
- Field changes occur continuously during construction
- If as-built records are not maintained concurrently, reconstruction at end of project is costly and error-prone
- Owner requires as-built drawings as condition of Substantial Performance (Section 7.5, page 24)
- CAD file delivery requirement means field redlines must be incorporated into CAD, not just marked up PDFs

**Methodology implications:**
- Methodology should describe as-built drawing maintenance process (who updates, how often, where stored)
- Site Superintendent responsibility to provide marked-up field changes to design team
- Consultant responsibility to update CAD files with as-built information
- **ASSUMPTION:** Weekly or bi-weekly as-built update cycles during active construction phases
- Final as-built deliverable verification before Substantial Performance claim

---

### C-07: Design Evolution and Change Management

**Consideration:** Design changes (Owner-initiated, field-discovered, or value engineering) must be managed through formal change control (Change Orders or Change Directives per CCDC 14).

**Factors to weigh:**
- Change Orders require Owner acceptance and are final (no further claims accepted per Appendix J SC41, page 68)
- Change Directives allow Owner to direct work before cost/time agreement is reached (CCDC 14 GC 6.3)
- Overhead and profit on changes is capped (20% for changes <$50k; 15% for changes >$50k) — Source: Appendix J SC40, page 68
- Design changes after IFC issuance are costly (rework of issued drawings, coordination impacts, potential construction delays)

**Methodology implications:**
- Methodology should emphasize early Owner decision-making to minimize post-IFC changes
- Value engineering should occur at Design Development and 60% stages, not after 100%
- Change control procedure should be clearly described with cost/schedule impact assessment process
- Design freezes at key milestones (e.g., no changes after 100% without formal Change Order) should be proposed

---

### C-08: Quality Management and Best Practice Standards

**Consideration:** RFP requires "current industry standards, good construction Best Practice, all applicable and referenced codes, regulations, standards and trade associations" (Section 7.2, page 20). "Best Practice" is defined as "techniques... widely recognized by peers and the industry as generally being the most effective" (Section 1, page 6).

**Best Practice Definition (canonical):** Per RFP Section 1, "Best Practice" means techniques widely recognized by peers and the industry as generally being the most effective. This definition is the canonical reference for all uses of "Best Practice" in:
- This document (Guidance.md)
- Specification.md R-19
- Procedure.md Step 7

*[Semantic Lensing B-007: Best Practice definition canonicalized per B:knowledge:consistency lens]*

**Factors to weigh:**
- "Best Practice" is somewhat subjective; what is considered best practice by Design-Builder may differ from Owner expectations
- Design-Build industry has established frameworks (e.g., DBIA best practices) that may or may not be familiar to Owner
- Quality standards must balance rigor with cost-effectiveness

**Methodology implications:**
- Methodology should reference recognized standards (e.g., DBIA Design-Build Done Right principles, if applicable)
- QA/QC approach should be specific, not generic ("we follow best practices")
- Alignment with Owner's operational standards (if any) should be confirmed during design
- **TBD:** Whether Owner has existing design/documentation standards that should be followed (not specified in RFP)

---

### C-09: Evaluation Committee Knowledge Level

**Consideration:** RFP states "Proponents should not assume that members of the Evaluation Committee are completely knowledgeable in all aspects of design and construction and therefore should submit information in a clear, concise, and comprehensive manner to ensure a full understanding" (Section 4.1, page 12).

**Factors to weigh:**
- Evaluation Committee includes operational managers (Protective Services, Operations, CAO, Corporate Services) plus third party representation — Source: RFP Section 1, page 6
- Technical design methodology details may need to be explained in plain language
- Overuse of jargon or overly technical descriptions may reduce comprehension and score
- BUT, methodology must still be credible to any third-party technical reviewers on Evaluation Committee

**Methodology implications:**
- Use clear, concise language; avoid unnecessary jargon
- Include plain-language summaries of complex processes
- Visual aids (flowcharts, diagrams, timelines) can improve comprehension
- Balance accessibility with technical credibility

---

### C-10: Addenda Integration as Methodology Input

**Consideration:** Addendum 03 provides significant scope clarifications and technical requirements that affect design approach. Methodology must demonstrate integration of these clarifications.

**Key Addendum 03 impacts on design methodology:**
- **12-acre developable site** (20 acres total; 8 acres dog park/storm pond in flood fringe) — affects site design scope — Source: Decomposition Section 4
- **Pickled sand storage building removed** from this RFP scope — reduces design scope — Source: Decomposition Section 4
- **Technical requirements:** overhead doors 16 ft height, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof/orientation — specific design requirements to incorporate — Source: Decomposition Section 4
- **Sample room size ranges** provided for selected spaces where program lacks sizes — guidance for space planning — Source: Decomposition Section 4

**Methodology implications:**
- Initial design phase should verify all Addendum 03 requirements are understood and incorporated into design basis
- Space programming should use provided size ranges as starting point, with Owner confirmation
- Technical systems (exhaust, generator, solar provisions) should be addressed early in design for coordination

---

## Trade-offs

### T-01: Design Completeness vs. Proposal Schedule

**Trade-off:** Proposal is due August 30, 2024 (RFP issued July 10, 2024 — 51 days). More thorough design during proposal phase improves proposal quality and reduces post-award risk, but requires more proposal effort and cost.

**Source:** RFP Section 2.6, page 9

**Options:**
1. **Minimal proposal design** — Schematic-level concept only; detailed design methodology described but not executed
2. **Moderate proposal design** — Concept design with preliminary system selections and outline specifications
3. **Extensive proposal design** — Near-Design Development level of detail to demonstrate methodology

**Considerations:**
- RFP requires "detailed design brief" in proposal with "all components and systems" described (Section 7.1.1, page 16)
- Evaluation weight is modest (3 points for methodology, 20 points for concept design, 5 points for design brief)
- Over-investment in proposal design may not yield proportional score improvement
- **ASSUMPTION:** Moderate approach (Option 2) is likely optimal — sufficient detail to score well without excessive proposal costs

---

### T-02: Prescriptive vs. Performance Specifications

**Trade-off:** Prescriptive specifications (specifying exact products/manufacturers) provide certainty but limit competition and may increase cost. Performance specifications (specifying performance criteria only) enable value optimization but increase submittal review effort and risk of non-compliance.

**Options:**
1. **Prescriptive approach** — Specify exact products (e.g., "ABC Company Model 123 overhead door operator or approved equal")
2. **Performance approach** — Specify performance requirements (e.g., "overhead door operator shall be rated for 50,000 cycles, provide remote control operation, and include battery backup")
3. **Hybrid approach** — Prescriptive for critical/high-risk items; performance for commodity items

**Considerations:**
- Owner emphasizes "best value and practical solution" (RFP Section 2.2, page 8)
- Owner expects "efficiency, innovation, and value for money" (RFP Section 4.3, page 12)
- Performance approach aligns with value optimization but requires strong submittal review process
- **ASSUMPTION:** Hybrid approach is likely optimal — prescriptive for specialty systems (fire apparatus exhaust, generator, HVAC); performance for general construction (doors, finishes, electrical fixtures)

**Methodology implication:** Describe specification philosophy and how product selection supports value and Owner operational needs (ease of maintenance, local availability, etc.)

---

### T-03: Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) vs. Sequential Design-Then-Build

**Trade-off:** Involving subcontractors early in design (Early Contractor Involvement) improves constructability and cost accuracy but may limit competitive bidding. Sequential design-then-bid approach maintains competition but risks constructability issues.

**Options:**
1. **ECI for all major trades** — Structural, mechanical, electrical, envelope subcontractors engaged during design
2. **ECI for high-risk items only** — E.g., fire apparatus exhaust system, overhead doors (specialty items)
3. **No ECI** — Complete design, then competitively bid all subcontracts

**Considerations:**
- RFP requires Appendix I (subtrade list) in proposal, suggesting key subtrades identified before award — Source: RFP Section 4.3, page 13
- Design-Build delivery model inherently supports ECI (single point responsibility)
- Owner values cost-effectiveness; ECI can reduce change order risk and improve cost certainty
- **ASSUMPTION:** ECI for specialty/high-risk items (Option 2) balances constructability with cost competitiveness

**Methodology implication:** Describe which trades/systems benefit from early involvement and at which design phases they are engaged.

---

### T-04: Fast-Track Permitting vs. Complete Design Before Permitting

**Trade-off:** Pursuing early/partial permits (e.g., foundation permit before full building permit) can accelerate construction start but increases risk of changes and rework. Waiting for complete design provides certainty but delays construction.

**Options:**
1. **Fast-track permitting** — Submit foundation permit application early; pursue building permit when design is further advanced
2. **Single permit application** — Submit complete building permit application after 100% IFC
3. **Hybrid** — Foundation permit early if site conditions dictate early foundation work; building permit follows

**Considerations:**
- Project is NOT schedule-driven; early construction start is not a priority — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 8
- Fast-tracking adds complexity and risk without corresponding schedule benefit to Owner
- Municipal permitting (Town of Penhold) is likely straightforward for this project type
- **ASSUMPTION:** Single permit application (Option 2) likely optimal given non-schedule-driven nature

**Methodology implication:** Describe permitting strategy aligned with Owner's schedule flexibility and risk tolerance.

**Tension with Datasheet milestones:** Note that Datasheet.md "Expected Design Submission Milestones" includes "Foundation Issued for Construction (if needed)" as a separate milestone, which implies possible early foundation release (fast-track approach). This trade-off recommends single permit application (no fast-track), which is in tension with the milestone structure. The resolution is:
- Milestone structure reflects RFP Section 7.1.8 possibilities
- This trade-off recommends against using fast-track given project context
- Final decision is Owner/Design-Builder post-award based on site conditions and value analysis

*[Semantic Lensing B-010: Tension with Datasheet milestones documented per B:wisdom:consistency lens]*

---

### T-05: Design Team Size and Consultant Engagement Model

**Trade-off:** Larger design team (more consultants, more staff) provides more capacity and specialization but increases overhead costs. Smaller team reduces cost but may bottleneck at review milestones.

**Options:**
1. **Full consultant team from start** — Architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, specialty consultants all engaged at Design Development
2. **Phased consultant engagement** — Architectural and civil start; structural/MEP join at 60%; specialty consultants as needed
3. **Lean team with external reviews** — Small core team; external peer reviews for QC

**Considerations:**
- Design Brief requires all disciplines addressed (RFP Section 7.1.2, pages 16-17)
- Coordination requirements demand concurrent discipline involvement — Source: Appendix J SC8, page 64
- Owner expects professional seal on all documents — all disciplines must have registered professional — Source: RFP Section 7.2, page 20
- **ASSUMPTION:** Full team from Design Development (Option 1) is necessary to meet coordination and quality requirements

**Methodology implication:** Describe consultant team structure and engagement model (roles, responsibilities, coordination mechanisms).

---

### T-06: Level of Detail in Proposal-Stage Methodology Description

**Trade-off:** Highly detailed methodology narrative demonstrates thoroughness but may be lengthy and reduce readability. Concise high-level methodology is easier to evaluate but may not demonstrate depth of understanding.

**Options:**
1. **High detail** — Detailed process steps, RACI matrices, specific timelines, flowcharts, forms/templates
2. **Moderate detail** — Clear process framework with key milestones and roles, but not step-by-step procedures
3. **High-level only** — Conceptual approach with principles, but minimal procedural detail

**Considerations:**
- RFP emphasizes "clear, concise, and comprehensive" (Section 4.1, page 12) — balance of brevity and completeness
- 15 MB PDF size limit for entire proposal (Section 4.2, page 12) — excessive detail in one deliverable reduces space for others
- Evaluation Committee evaluates extent of "understanding of the requirements" (Section 8.3, page 27) — detail demonstrates understanding
- **ASSUMPTION:** Moderate detail (Option 2) likely optimal — clear framework with enough specificity to demonstrate competence

**Methodology implication:** Structure narrative with executive summary/overview, then supporting detail; use visual aids to convey complexity concisely.

**Tension with innovation aspiration:** Note potential tension between this trade-off (moderate detail assumption) and evaluation scoring which awards 100% for innovation (Specification.md Notes). If targeting top scores (100% Exceptional), the methodology may need to include innovative elements that demonstrate more than moderate detail in specific areas. The "moderate detail" assumption optimizes for efficiency but may limit innovation demonstration.

## Examples

### Example 1: Design Milestone Review Cycle (ASSUMPTION)

**ASSUMPTION:** A typical review cycle for the 60% Detailed Design milestone might follow this sequence:

1. **Design-Builder preparation** (2-3 weeks) — Consultants develop 60% drawings and outline specifications
2. **Internal QC review** (3-5 days) — Design-Builder reviews for coordination and completeness before submission
3. **Submission to Owner** — 60% package delivered with transmittal and review request
4. **Owner/Owner's Advisor review** (10-15 business days) — Review for OSR compliance, functionality, cost implications
5. **Review meeting** (1-2 hours) — Discuss findings, clarify Owner direction, agree on action items
6. **Design-Builder response** (1-2 weeks) — Address Owner comments, revise drawings/specs
7. **Resubmission (if needed)** — Updated 60% package or proceed to next milestone based on extent of revisions
8. **Owner acceptance** — Approval to proceed to next milestone (100% Building Detail Design)

**Source for concept:** RFP Section 7.1.8 specifies "time for review and resubmission" at each milestone (page 18); specific durations are ASSUMPTION based on typical practice.

### Example 2: Interdisciplinary Coordination Meeting Agenda (ASSUMPTION)

**ASSUMPTION:** A typical coordination meeting during design phases might include:

**Attendees:** Architect (lead), Civil Engineer, Structural Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Design-Builder PM

**Frequency:** Weekly during active design phases (Design Development, 60%, 100%)

**Agenda:**
1. Design progress update by discipline (completeness %, issues identified)
2. Coordination issue review (clashes, conflicts, interface gaps identified since last meeting)
3. Issue resolution (assign responsibility, agree on solution approach, document decision)
4. Upcoming milestones and deliverables (who is submitting what, by when)
5. Owner/Project Committee feedback from recent reviews
6. Action item review (close-out completed items, update open items)

**Documentation:** Meeting minutes with action item register (assigned to, due date, status)

**Source for concept:** General design management best practice; not explicitly specified in RFP but implied by coordination requirements (Appendix J SC8, page 64).

### Example 3: Municipal Permit Application Sequence (ASSUMPTION - Town of Penhold context)

**ASSUMPTION:** For a Town of Penhold project, permitting sequence might be:

1. **Pre-application consultation** (during Design Development) — Meet with Town building/planning staff to discuss project, confirm zoning (PI - Public and Institutional, no redesignation required per RFP Section 2.2, page 8), discuss code interpretation
2. **Development Permit application** (at 100% Building Detail Design or earlier) — Submit site plan, building elevations, confirm compliance with Land Use Bylaw
3. **Building Permit application** (at 100% IFC or shortly after) — Submit complete IFC package (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical)
4. **Permit review and approval** (AHJ review time TBD — typical small municipality may be 2-4 weeks)
5. **Permit issuance** — Authorization to commence construction
6. **Inspections during construction** — Footing, foundation, framing, rough-in (mechanical/electrical), insulation, final
7. **Occupancy Permit** — Issued upon successful final inspection and commissioning

**Source for concept:** General Alberta municipal permitting practice; specific Town of Penhold process and timelines are **TBD** (not detailed in RFP).

### Example 4: Value Engineering Workshop Approach (ASSUMPTION)

**ASSUMPTION:** To leverage Owner's schedule flexibility for cost reduction (per RFP Section 2.2, page 8), a formal value engineering workshop might be conducted:

**Timing:** After Design Development submission, before 60% Detailed Design commences

**Participants:** Design-Builder team (Architect, Engineers, Estimator, Constructor), Owner/Project Committee

**Duration:** 1-2 days (full-day workshop plus follow-up session)

**Process:**
1. **Information phase** — Review design basis, OSR, cost model, operational requirements
2. **Speculation phase** — Brainstorm alternatives for high-cost items (structural system, building envelope, mechanical systems, site work)
3. **Evaluation phase** — Assess alternatives for cost impact, OSR compliance, life-cycle implications, schedule impact
4. **Development phase** — Develop promising alternatives to sufficient detail for Owner decision
5. **Presentation phase** — Present recommendations to Owner with cost/benefit analysis
6. **Decision phase** — Owner selects preferred alternatives; Design-Builder incorporates into 60% design

**Focus areas for this project (ASSUMPTION based on building type):**
- Structural system (clear-span requirements for apparatus bays and storage buildings)
- Building envelope (durability and maintenance per RFP Section 7.1.4)
- Mechanical systems (HVAC for large bay spaces, fire apparatus exhaust system)
- Site development (paving extent, stormwater management, future expansion provisions)

## Lifecycle Feedback Note

**Post-occupancy lessons learned:** The Guidance considerations (C-01 through C-10) and trade-offs (T-01 through T-06) address design-phase activities comprehensively but do not address post-occupancy lessons-learned or feedback loop from warranty period into future design practice. This is appropriate for the proposal-stage methodology narrative, as the focus is on design delivery. However, for continuous improvement:
- Consider documenting lessons learned during 12-month warranty period
- Feed warranty issues back into design practice for future projects
- This is beyond scope of DEL-03-01 but noted for organizational learning

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

**Status:** Conflicts identified during Pass 3 (Semantic Lensing Enrichment) are documented below.

| Conflict ID | Source Items | Description | Documents Affected | Proposed Resolution | Human Ruling |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| B-010 | Guidance T-04, Datasheet Milestones | Guidance recommends single permit (no fast-track) but Datasheet includes Foundation IFC milestone (implies possible fast-track) | Guidance.md, Datasheet.md | Milestone structure reflects RFP possibilities; T-04 is recommended strategy for this project; final decision post-award | TBD |
| X-006 | Guidance T-06, Specification Notes | T-06 assumes moderate detail is optimal; Specification Notes indicates 100% score requires innovation which may require more detail | Guidance.md, Specification.md | Target moderate detail overall with selective depth in innovative areas | TBD |
| D-001 | Specification R-30, Procedure Step 3.6 | Specification marks BIM as TBD; Procedure references "clash detection, overlay reviews" implying 3D coordination | Specification.md, Procedure.md | Clarified in Specification R-30 that coordination can be traditional overlay methods, not necessarily BIM | TBD |
