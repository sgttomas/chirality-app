### Expected Design Submission Milestones

From RFP Section 7.1.8 (page 18), the following design review milestones are expected:

| Milestone | Description | Review/Resubmission Time Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Building Design Development | Initial design direction and approach | **ASSUMPTION:** 10-15 business days |
| 60% Detailed Design review | Intermediate design progress check | **ASSUMPTION:** 10-15 business days |
| Foundation Issued for Construction | Foundation-specific release (if needed) | **ASSUMPTION:** 5-10 business days |
| 100% Building Detail Design | Complete design package before IFC | **ASSUMPTION:** 5-10 business days |
| 100% IFC Detailed Design Package | Full Issued for Construction package | **ASSUMPTION:** 5-10 business days |

*[Semantic Lensing B-002: Review durations populated with proposed assumptions per B:data:completeness lens; sourced from Guidance.md C-02]*

**Note on Foundation IFC Milestone:** The "Foundation Issued for Construction (if needed)" milestone trigger conditions are **TBD** — decision to be made by Owner/Design-Builder post-award based on site conditions, schedule optimization needs, and permitting strategy.
*[Semantic Lensing B-011: Conditional milestone trigger criteria flagged per B:wisdom:consistency lens]*

### Document Format Requirements
- **Format:** Narrative text (part of PDF proposal submission)
- **Size constraint:** Contributes to overall 15 MB PDF limit — Source: RFP Section 4.2, page 12
- **Ordering requirement:** Must follow main headings and present information in order provided in Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 — Source: RFP Section 4.3, page 12
- **Page/word count allocation:** **TBD** — Recommended allocation to be determined based on overall proposal structure and relative weighting (3 of 100 points suggests proportionally modest allocation)
  - *[Semantic Lensing E-007: Space allocation within proposal PDF flagged as TBD per E:evaluative:completeness lens]*

### Implementation Capacity (ASSUMPTION)
- **Estimated production effort:** **TBD** — Effort to be estimated during proposal planning based on team availability and other deliverable demands
- **Team size:** **TBD** — Minimum: Design Manager/PM as primary author with input from discipline leads; full team composition per Procedure.md
- **Production timeline:** **TBD** — To be coordinated with proposal schedule constraints
  - *[Semantic Lensing X-003: Implementation capacity attributes added per X:applying:necessity lens]*

## Conditions

### Upstream Dependencies
- Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (NOT_TRACKED mode) — Source: `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
- **ASSUMPTION:** Likely depends on concept design direction (DEL-02-01) to describe methodology for that specific concept
- **ASSUMPTION:** Likely informs detailed design documentation plan (DEL-03-02)
- **Strategic prerequisite question:** Is concept design direction (DEL-02-01) a hard prerequisite, or can methodology narrative be written generically? — **TBD:** To be determined during proposal planning
  - *[Semantic Lensing X-001: Prerequisite foundation uncertainty flagged per X:guiding:necessity lens]*

### Constraints
- Must demonstrate understanding that project is NOT schedule-driven — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 8; Decomposition Section 2
- Must address Owner's flexibility on schedule and how it can reduce costs or increase value — Source: RFP Section 2.2, page 8
- Must align with CCDC 14-2013 contract framework — Source: RFP Section 5.4, page 15
- Must address Design-Build project delivery methodology specifically — Source: RFP Section 7.1, page 16

### Success Criteria
- **Acceptance criteria:** Meets Section 7.1 intent; clear phases and interfaces with Owner/OSR — Source: `_CONTEXT.md`
- **Scoring approach:** Evaluated on scale from 0-100% of 3 available points based on extent of meeting expectations — Source: RFP Section 8.3, pages 26-27
- **Quality threshold:** Response should demonstrate "clear understanding of requirements that provides certainty of success" for high scores (80-100%) — Source: RFP Section 8.3, page 27
- **Adjudicative authority:** Evaluation Committee evaluates proposals; committee composition and disagreement resolution process per RFP Section 8.1 — **TBD:** Specific adjudicative process not detailed in accessible sources
  - *[Semantic Lensing X-005: Adjudicative authority clarification flagged per X:judging:necessity lens]*

## Construction

### Document Structure (ASSUMPTION - typical design methodology narrative)

**ASSUMPTION:** Based on RFP requirements and design management best practices, the narrative should be structured to address:

1. **Introduction/Overview** — Design-Build delivery model and collaborative intent
2. **Design Process Framework** — Phases, gates, milestones aligned to RFP Section 7.1.8
3. **Stakeholder Engagement Approach** — Owner, Project Committee, Project Manager interaction model
4. **Review and Approval Process** — Submission-review-resubmission cycles with timelines
5. **Municipal Permitting Strategy** — AHJ engagement, permit sequencing, inspection coordination
6. **Design Controls and Quality** — QA/QC, coordination across disciplines, compliance verification
7. **Innovation and Value** — How methodology enables value optimization and cost-effectiveness
8. **Special Considerations** — Project-specific factors (not schedule-driven, addenda integration, etc.)

## Semantic Lensing Notes

### Status Terminology Clarification
- **Datasheet "Status: OPEN"** refers to document generation/production state (this deliverable is open for production)
- **_STATUS.md "SEMANTIC_READY"** refers to deliverable lifecycle tracking state (ready for semantic lensing enrichment)
- These are distinct tracking systems and are not in conflict
  - *[Semantic Lensing B-005: Status terminology clarified per B:information:consistency lens; _STATUS.md is authoritative for lifecycle state]*

### Canonical Document Structure
The narrative structure defined in "Construction > Document Structure" section of this Datasheet is the canonical source for the eight-section narrative outline. Procedure.md Step 2 references this structure.
