# Deliverable: DEL-03-01 Design Methodology Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable articulates the structured design process -- its sequencing, stakeholder engagement, review controls, and permitting approach -- for a collaborative Design-Build delivery that must demonstrate value optimization through schedule flexibility. It carries knowledge of how multi-disciplinary coordination and professional accountability translate into credible, transparent progression from concept through construction documentation.
