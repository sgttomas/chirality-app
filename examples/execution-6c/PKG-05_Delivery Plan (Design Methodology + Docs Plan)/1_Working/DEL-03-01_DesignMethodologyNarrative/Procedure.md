## Steps

### Step 1: Review RFP Requirements and Context

**Action:**
1. Read RFP Section 7.1 (Design Methodology requirements, page 16) and identify the seven mandatory content elements:
   - Design deliverables production approach
   - Stakeholder and Project Team engagement
   - Collaborative design process
   - Design process sequencing
   - Review and approval timelines
   - Municipal permitting process
   - Special considerations
2. Read RFP Section 7.1.8 (page 18) and note the five design submission milestones:
   - Building Design Development
   - 60% Detailed Design review
   - Foundation Issued for Construction (if needed)
   - 100% Building Detail Design
   - 100% IFC Detailed Design Package
3. Read `_CONTEXT.md` for deliverable identity and acceptance criteria
4. Read Decomposition document Section 8 (DEL-03-01 entry) and Section 9 (SOW-008) for scope definition
5. Review Specification.md requirements (R-01 through R-30) for compliance checklist

**Verification:** All RFP requirements identified and understood; acceptance criteria clear.

**Intermediate checkpoint:** Before proceeding to Step 2, verify that each RFP Section 7.1 mandatory element can be mapped to a specific narrative section. Create a traceability matrix showing each mandatory element and where it will be addressed.

*[Semantic Lensing A-003: Intermediate verification checkpoint added per A:normative:applying lens]*

**Output:** Requirements checklist and content outline.

---

### Step 2: Establish Narrative Structure

**Action:**
1. Develop narrative outline addressing all seven RFP Section 7.1 mandatory elements (see Specification.md R-01 through R-07)
2. **Canonical structure source:** Datasheet.md "Construction > Document Structure" section is the canonical source for the eight-section narrative outline. The structure below references that canonical source:
   - **Introduction/Overview** — Design-Build delivery model and collaborative intent
   - **Design Process Framework** — Phases, gates, milestones aligned to RFP Section 7.1.8
   - **Stakeholder Engagement Approach** — Owner, Project Committee, Project Manager interaction model
   - **Review and Approval Process** — Submission-review-resubmission cycles with timelines
   - **Municipal Permitting Strategy** — AHJ engagement, permit sequencing, inspection coordination
   - **Design Controls and Quality** — QA/QC, coordination across disciplines, compliance verification
   - **Innovation and Value** — How methodology enables value optimization and cost-effectiveness
   - **Special Considerations** — Project-specific factors (not schedule-driven, addenda integration, etc.)
3. Align structure with Guidance.md Principles (P-01 through P-08) to ensure narrative reflects Design-Build integration, Owner collaboration, schedule flexibility as value lever, etc.
4. Coordinate with Construction Methodology narrative (DEL-04-01) to ensure consistency in terminology, assumptions, and sequencing

**Verification:** Narrative structure covers all RFP requirements and aligns with Specification.md and Guidance.md.

**Output:** Detailed narrative outline with section headings and key content points.

   - Address Owner's Advisor role (if retained) for OSR interpretation (Appendix J SC13, page 64)
   - Describe initial OSR review process (mandatory per Appendix J SC23, page 66)

4. **Review and Approval Process section:**
   - Describe submission-review-resubmission cycle at each design milestone
   - **Propose specific review durations** (e.g., 10-15 business days for major milestones) — addresses RFP Section 7.1 requirement for "timelines for review and approvals"
   - Clarify that Design-Builder retains full design responsibility despite Owner reviews (Appendix J SC14, page 65)
   - Describe design change management integration (Change Orders/Change Directives per RFP Section 7.2, page 19)

5. **Municipal Permitting Strategy section:**
   - Describe pre-application consultation with Town of Penhold (AHJ)
   - Outline permit sequence (Development Permit, Building Permit)
   - **Propose permitting timeline** (e.g., permit application at 100% IFC, review duration TBD based on AHJ)
   - Address inspection coordination (footing, foundation, framing, rough-in, insulation, final, occupancy permit per RFP Section 7.5, page 24)
   - Confirm Design-Builder responsibility for all permits and costs (RFP Section 7.2, page 19)

6. **Design Controls and Quality section:**
   - Describe QA/QC checkpoints at each design phase (internal review before Owner submission)
   - Address interdisciplinary coordination process (weekly coordination meetings during active phases per Guidance.md Example 2)
   - Describe coordination verification (clash detection, overlay reviews, drawing/spec consistency checks per Appendix J SC8, page 64)

**Verification:** All Specification.md requirements (R-01 through R-30) addressed; narrative aligns with Guidance.md principles and considerations.

**Output:** Complete narrative draft.

---

### Step 4: Incorporate Cross-Deliverable Consistency

**Action:**
1. Review Construction Methodology narrative (DEL-04-01) and ensure consistency in:
   - Terminology (e.g., "Design-Builder," "Owner," "Project Committee," milestone names)
   - Schedule assumptions (e.g., design milestone durations match construction schedule)
   - Process integration points (e.g., constructability reviews, value engineering timing)
2. Review Detailed Project Schedule (DEL-08-01) and ensure design milestones and review durations align
3. Review Design Brief narrative (DEL-02-02) and ensure design methodology describes how Design Brief disciplines (architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical) are coordinated
4. Confirm pricing narrative (DEL-05-03) assumptions align with design methodology (e.g., value engineering approach, consultant scope)
5. **Review Detailed Design Documentation Plan (DEL-03-02)** — This is the most proximate companion deliverable in PKG-05; ensure:
   - Methodology (DEL-03-01) and documentation plan (DEL-03-02) use consistent terminology
   - Design process outputs align with documentation plan inputs
   - QA/QC procedures are consistent across both deliverables

*[Semantic Lensing C-005: DEL-03-02 added to cross-deliverable consistency check per C:operative:completeness lens]*

**Coordination method:** For cross-deliverable consistency, use the following protocol:
- Maintain shared terminology register (key terms defined consistently)
- Cross-reference related sections explicitly in narrative
- Document any conflicts for resolution before finalization

*[Semantic Lensing D-004: Coordination method specified per D:operative:applying lens]*

**Verification:** No contradictions or inconsistencies across related deliverables.

**Output:** Consistency check completed; narrative updated as needed.

---

### Step 5: Apply Guidance Principles and Address Trade-offs

**Action:**
1. Review Guidance.md Principles (P-01 through P-08) and verify narrative reflects:
   - P-01: Design-Build integration (constructability, value engineering)
   - P-02: Owner collaboration (transparency, engagement, documentation)
   - P-03: Schedule flexibility as value lever (explicit discussion of cost/value optimization)
   - P-04: Value as differentiator (beyond compliance, innovation)
   - P-05: Multi-disciplinary coordination (coordination meetings, clash detection)
   - P-06: Professional accountability (seal requirements, professional review)
   - P-07: Design-Builder retains design responsibility (Owner review does not transfer liability)
   - P-08: Permitting as design constraint (code compliance integrated from start)

2. Review Guidance.md Trade-offs (T-01 through T-06) and make explicit decisions where needed:
   - T-02: Prescriptive vs. performance specifications — describe approach (ASSUMPTION: hybrid per Guidance.md)
   - T-03: Early Contractor Involvement — describe which trades/systems (ASSUMPTION: ECI for specialty/high-risk items)
   - T-04: Fast-track permitting vs. complete design — select approach (ASSUMPTION: single permit application per Guidance.md given non-schedule-driven nature)
   - T-05: Design team size — confirm full consultant team from Design Development (ASSUMPTION per Guidance.md)
   - T-06: Level of detail — ensure narrative is moderate detail (clear framework, not step-by-step procedures per Guidance.md)

**Trade-off decision capture protocol:** For each trade-off decision:
- Document which option was selected
- Record the rationale for selection
- Note who made the decision (author or delegated to stakeholder)
- Store decision record with draft narrative versions (see Records section)

*[Semantic Lensing C-006: Trade-off decision capture protocol added per C:operative:consistency lens]*

**Verification:** Narrative reflects Guidance.md principles and makes explicit trade-off selections where needed.

**Output:** Narrative refined with principles and trade-offs integrated.

---

### Step 6: Add Visual Aids and Supporting Material (Recommended)

**Note:** Given Guidance C-09 emphasis that Evaluation Committee may not be technical, visual aids are recommended rather than optional. Visual communication tools may be critical for evaluation success.

*[Semantic Lensing E-004: Visual aids elevated from optional to recommended per E:operative:completeness lens]*

**Action:**
1. Include visual aids to improve clarity and comprehension (per RFP Section 4.1, Evaluation Committee may not be completely knowledgeable, page 12):
   - **Design process flowchart** — showing phases, milestones, review gates, decision points
   - **Timeline diagram** — showing design milestones with proposed review durations
   - **Coordination matrix** — showing interdisciplinary coordination touchpoints
   - **Permitting sequence diagram** — showing permit applications and construction phasing

2. Ensure any graphics are clear, labeled, and support the narrative (do not add complexity)

3. Verify graphics contribution to 15 MB PDF size limit (RFP Section 4.2, page 12)

**Verification:** Visual aids improve clarity without excessive file size.

**Output:** Narrative with integrated graphics.

---

### Step 7: Quality Control Review

**QC role assignments:** Assign specific QC responsibilities before beginning review:
- **Completeness check:** Primary author (Design Manager/PM)
- **Clarity and readability check:** Peer reviewer (non-technical reader preferred)
- **Consistency check:** Lead Architect or designated discipline lead
- **Compliance check:** Primary author with input from Construction Manager

*[Semantic Lensing D-005: QC roles specified per D:operative:reviewing lens]*

**Action:**
1. **Completeness check:**
   - Verify all seven RFP Section 7.1 mandatory elements are addressed
   - Verify all Specification.md requirements (R-01 through R-30) are addressed
   - Verify acceptance criteria from `_CONTEXT.md` are met ("Meets Section 7.1 intent; clear phases and interfaces with Owner/OSR")

2. **Clarity and readability check:**
   - Review for plain language (avoid unnecessary jargon per Guidance.md C-09)
   - Verify narrative is "clear, concise, and comprehensive" per RFP Section 4.1, page 12 (canonical source for plain language requirement)
   - Check for consistent terminology (e.g., "Owner" not "Town," "Design-Builder" not "Contractor")

   *[Semantic Lensing B-007: RFP Section 4.1 cited as canonical source for plain language per B:knowledge:consistency lens]*

3. **Consistency check:**
   - Cross-reference with Datasheet.md, Specification.md, Guidance.md for consistency
   - Verify cross-deliverable consistency (DEL-04-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-05-03, DEL-03-02)

4. **Compliance check:**
   - Verify addenda acknowledgment (Addendum 03 impacts integrated)
   - Verify no non-compliance risks introduced (e.g., proposed timelines are reasonable, not aggressive)

**Verification:** Narrative passes all QC checks.

**Output:** QC checklist completed; issues resolved.

---

### Step 8: Final Review and Approval

**Entry criteria:** Before beginning Step 8, the following prerequisites must be verified:
- Step 7 QC checklist is complete and signed off
- All QC issues from Step 7 have been resolved
- Cross-deliverable consistency confirmed (Step 4)
- Trade-off decisions documented (Step 5)

*[Semantic Lensing X-007: Entry criteria added per X:reviewing:necessity lens]*

**Action:**
1. Submit draft narrative to Design Manager / PM for review
2. Circulate to key stakeholders (Lead Architect, Construction Manager, Scheduler) for technical review
3. Incorporate feedback and resolve comments
4. Obtain final approval from Design Manager / PM
5. Deliver to Proposal Manager for integration into proposal PDF

**Verification:** Final narrative approved by responsible parties.

**Output:** Approved Design Methodology Narrative ready for proposal inclusion.

## Verification

### Procedure Execution Verification

| Verification Point | Method | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------|
| RFP requirements coverage | Checklist review against RFP Section 7.1 | All seven mandatory elements addressed |
| Specification compliance | Checklist review against Specification.md R-01 through R-30 | All requirements addressed or marked TBD with rationale |
| Cross-document consistency | Review Datasheet.md, Specification.md, Guidance.md | Terminology, values, assumptions consistent |
| Cross-deliverable consistency | Review DEL-04-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-05-03 | No contradictions or inconsistencies |
| Clarity and readability | Peer review by non-technical reader | Narrative is understandable without specialized knowledge |
| Acceptance criteria | Review against `_CONTEXT.md` | "Meets Section 7.1 intent; clear phases and interfaces with Owner/OSR" |

### Deliverable Quality Gates

**Minimum acceptable quality:**
- All RFP Section 7.1 requirements addressed (mandatory compliance)
- Narrative is clear and concise (per RFP Section 4.1)
- No contradictions with other proposal sections
- Addenda integrated (Addendum 03 impacts acknowledged)

**Target quality (for high evaluation scores):**
- Demonstrates innovation or exceptional thoroughness (80-100% score range per RFP Section 8.3, page 27)
- Clearly articulates value optimization approach (leverages schedule flexibility per RFP Section 2.2)
- Provides confidence in Design-Builder's design process competence

**Quality target verification method:** **TBD** — Procedure does not define how achievement of target quality (80-100% score range) is verified internally before submission. Consider:
- Internal scoring simulation using RFP Section 8.3 criteria
- Peer review by someone familiar with evaluation methodology
- Checklist of innovation/differentiation elements included

*[Semantic Lensing F-009: Quality target verification method flagged per F:evaluative:completeness lens]*

## Records

### Documentation to Retain

1. **Draft narrative versions** — track evolution and decisions made
2. **Stakeholder review comments** — document feedback and resolutions
3. **QC checklist** — evidence of completeness and compliance verification
4. **Cross-deliverable coordination notes** — track consistency discussions with DEL-04-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-03-02, etc.
5. **Final approved narrative** — version submitted in proposal PDF
6. **Trade-off decision records** — rationale for each T-01 through T-06 selection (per Step 5 protocol)

**Cross-reference note:** This Records list documents production records retained for the proposal process. Specification.md Documentation section lists 11 required project deliverables from the design methodology (schedule, design submissions, shop drawing reviews, meeting minutes, etc.). These are different record types serving different purposes:
- Procedure Records = proposal production artifacts
- Specification Documentation = project execution deliverables

*[Semantic Lensing X-009: Records vs. Documentation distinction clarified per X:reviewing:consistency lens]*

### Post-Submission Reflection (Optional)

**ASSUMPTION:** Consider adding a post-submission reflection step to validate whether the methodology narrative achieved its intended quality and completeness goals. This could include:
- Brief lessons-learned capture after proposal submission
- Feedback from proposal team on process effectiveness
- Input into future proposal development

*[Semantic Lensing D-007: Post-submission reflection suggested per D:evaluative:reviewing lens]*

### Integration with Proposal Package

- Narrative integrated into proposal PDF by Proposal Manager (DEL-01-02)
- Ensure narrative appears in correct order per RFP Sections 6-9 requirement (RFP Section 4.3, page 12)
- Verify contribution to 15 MB PDF size limit (RFP Section 4.2, page 12)

---

## Notes

### Key Success Factors

1. **Early coordination** — Engage with Construction Methodology (DEL-04-01) and Schedule (DEL-08-01) authors early to ensure alignment
2. **Principle-driven narrative** — Ground narrative in Guidance.md principles (Design-Build integration, Owner collaboration, schedule flexibility, value optimization)
3. **Concrete over generic** — Avoid generic "we follow best practices" statements; provide specific processes, timelines, and touchpoints
4. **Balanced detail** — Provide enough detail to demonstrate competence without overwhelming reader (moderate detail per Guidance.md T-06)
5. **Innovation differentiation** — Identify at least one innovative element to target 90-100% evaluation score (per RFP Section 8.3, page 27)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Missing RFP Section 7.1 elements** — Ensure all seven mandatory content elements are explicitly addressed
2. **Vague timelines** — RFP requires "timelines for review and approvals" (Section 7.1, page 16); provide specific durations, not "as needed" or "TBD"
3. **Ignoring schedule flexibility** — Owner explicitly states project is NOT schedule-driven (Section 2.2, page 8); methodology must leverage this
4. **Inconsistency with Construction Methodology** — Design and construction narratives must align (terminology, assumptions, sequencing)
5. **Overpromising** — Avoid commitments that cannot be met post-award (e.g., unrealistic review turnaround times)

### Assumptions Requiring Validation

The following assumptions are made in this procedure and should be validated during narrative development:

- **ASSUMPTION:** Proposed Owner review durations (10-15 business days for major milestones) are acceptable — confirm with Owner's capacity or adjust based on similar project experience
- **ASSUMPTION:** Full consultant team engaged from Design Development (not phased engagement) — confirm with project budget and consultant availability
- **ASSUMPTION:** Single permit application approach (not fast-track) — confirm alignment with Owner's schedule expectations and construction approach (DEL-04-01)
- **ASSUMPTION:** Hybrid specification approach (prescriptive for specialty, performance for commodity) — confirm with Owner's preferences and operational standards (if any)
- **ASSUMPTION:** Value engineering workshop at Design Development — confirm timing aligns with schedule and estimating approach

### Communication Protocol (Post-Award)

**Note:** The Procedure focuses on proposal-stage narrative production. For post-award execution, the design methodology should include a communication plan/protocol for Design-Builder communication with Owner between formal milestones. This is addressed in the narrative content (Step 3 item 3, Stakeholder Engagement Approach) but should be called out explicitly:

- Communication mechanism between milestones (e.g., email, project portal, informal updates)
- Escalation path for urgent issues
- Response time expectations
