**QC Checkpoint Success Criteria:** **TBD** — Methodology should define what constitutes an acceptable QC outcome at each design milestone (e.g., coordination issues resolved, code compliance verified, professional review complete). Without defined success criteria, QC becomes procedural rather than substantive.

*[Semantic Lensing A-008: QC checkpoint success criteria flagged as TBD per A:operative:judging lens]*

**Best Practice Definition:** Per RFP Section 1 (page 6), "Best Practice" means "techniques... widely recognized by peers and the industry as generally being the most effective." All uses of "Best Practice" in this specification should be understood with this RFP-defined meaning.

*[Semantic Lensing B-007: Best Practice definition anchored to RFP Section 1 per B:knowledge:consistency lens]*

**Related:** Decomposition references quality management plan requirement (SOW-027) for design QC, construction QC, commissioning QC, documentation QC — Source: Decomposition Section 9, SOW-027

**Requirement:** The methodology shall reflect integration of all addenda impacts on design approach.

**Source:** RFP Section 2.9, page 11; Decomposition Section 4 (Addenda Integration Summary)

**Key addenda impacts:**

**Acceptance:** Methodology acknowledges addenda-driven design considerations.

**Compliance judgment criteria:** To achieve compliance ruling (not merely acknowledgment), the methodology must:
1. Explicitly list each addendum reviewed

**Acceptance:** Methodology references Design Brief development as part of design process.

---

### R-24: Substantial Performance and Closeout Integration (Interface Requirement)

**Requirement:** The methodology shall address design activities continuing through Substantial Performance and Total Completion, including as-built drawing preparation.

2. Final commissioning documents
3. All operations and maintenance manuals
4. As-Built Drawings
5. A Legal Survey

Source: RFP Section 7.5, page 24

**Training/Orientation consideration:** **TBD** — The methodology may need to address design support for Owner operations staff training/orientation as part of closeout activities, particularly for specialty systems (fire apparatus exhaust, HVAC controls, security systems). This requirement may be addressed in RFP Section 7.5 or related deliverables but is not explicitly scoped for DEL-03-01.

*[Semantic Lensing F-005: Training/orientation flagged per F:operative:completeness lens]*

---

### R-25: Design Consultant Site Inspection Cadence (Mandatory)

**Requirement:** The methodology shall ensure Design-Builder's consultant team for each discipline performs regular site inspections with written reports accompanying each progress draw.

**Inspection frequency:**
- **Architect:** Minimum monthly inspections
- **Other disciplines:** Inspections per approved project schedule and at all critical milestones

**Source:** RFP Section 7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration), page 21

**Acceptance:** Methodology specifies consultant site inspection schedule and reporting requirements.

---

### R-26: Owner's Review Without Responsibility (Critical Constraint)

**Requirement:** The methodology shall acknowledge that nothing in the Contract, including any review or acceptance by Owner or Owner's Advisor, makes the Owner responsible for the design. The Design-Builder remains solely liable for compliance with OSR and all Contract requirements.

**Source:** Appendix J SC14 (paragraph 2.5.3), page 65

**Acceptance:** Methodology clarifies Design-Builder retains full design responsibility notwithstanding Owner reviews. Beyond simple acknowledgment, methodology should include specific process safeguards demonstrating how Design-Builder maintains accountability (e.g., internal QC review prior to Owner submission, professional seal as QC gate, documented design basis records).

*[Semantic Lensing D-002: Acceptance strengthened to require process safeguards per D:normative:judging lens]*

---

### R-27: CAD Software Compatibility (Technical Requirement)

**Requirement:** Drawings shall be prepared using compatible computer aided drafting software.

**Acceptance:** Methodology includes design support during deficiency review, 12-month warranty review, and deficiency correction.

---

### R-29: Value Engineering Process (Recommended)

**Requirement:** The methodology should describe any formal value engineering or value optimization process during design phases.

**Rationale:** RFP encourages alternative options and creative methods to maintain efficiency (Section 8.5, page 28), and Owner emphasizes value and practical solutions (Section 2.2, page 8), but specific value engineering process requirements are not detailed in accessible sources.

**ASSUMPTION:** Best practice would include formal value engineering workshops at Design Development and/or 60% stages.

**Status clarification:** This requirement is classified as "Recommended" rather than "TBD" — the methodology is not obligated to include value engineering but should either describe the VE approach or explicitly state that formal VE is not proposed (with rationale).

*[Semantic Lensing F-002: Requirement status clarified from TBD to Recommended per F:normative:sufficiency lens]*

---

### R-30: BIM/3D Coordination Requirements (Optional)

**Requirement:** Use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) or other 3D coordination tools is not required by the RFP but may be proposed as part of the design methodology.

**Note:** RFP Section 7.1.1 states "Though not required, Proponents may wish to provide 3-D renderings to augment their submission" (page 16), but this refers to proposal presentation, not design production methodology.

**ASSUMPTION:** If BIM is proposed, methodology should describe BIM execution plan, model coordination process, and deliverable formats.

**Status clarification:** This requirement is classified as "Optional" rather than "TBD." If the methodology references 3D coordination capabilities (e.g., clash detection, overlay reviews), the Procedure should either:
1. Confirm BIM/3D tools will be used and describe the approach, OR
2. Clarify that 3D coordination refers to traditional overlay methods, not BIM

*[Semantic Lensing D-001, E-002: Requirement status clarified; conflict between Specification TBD and Procedure 3D references flagged per D:normative:guiding and E:normative:completeness lenses]*

### Evaluation Context

This deliverable is part of the **Project Delivery Plan** evaluation category:

| Sub-criterion | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Design Methodology | 3 |
| Construction Methodology | 3 |
| Commissioning, Training and Closeout Procedures | 2 |
| Detailed Project Schedule | 2 |
| **Project Delivery Plan Total** | **10** |

Source: RFP Section 8.3, page 26

**Critical success factor:** Design Methodology narrative must be "clear, concise, and comprehensive" to ensure Evaluation Committee (who may not be completely knowledgeable in all aspects of design and construction) has "full understanding of the design intent" — Source: RFP Section 4.1, page 12

### Key Differentiators for High Scores

Based on RFP evaluation scoring matrix (Section 8.3, page 27):

| Score Range | Rating | Key Characteristics |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| 100% | Exceptional | Exceeds expectations, demonstrates clear understanding, provides certainty of success, **adds a level of innovation** |
| 90% | Excellent | Exceeds expectations, demonstrates clear understanding, provides certainty of success |
| 80% | Very Good | Meets expectations, demonstrates understanding, gives high level of confidence |
| 70% | Good | Meets most expectations, moderate level of confidence |
| 60% | Fair | Meets basic expectations, some risk to project success |

**Implication:** To achieve top scores (90-100%), the methodology must go beyond merely describing a compliant process — it must demonstrate innovation or exceptional clarity/thoroughness.

### Plain Language Requirement

**Canonical source:** RFP Section 4.1 (page 12) establishes the "clear, concise, and comprehensive" standard for proposal submissions. This requirement is referenced in:
- Specification.md (this document) — Key Differentiators section
- Guidance.md — Consideration C-09
- Procedure.md — Step 7 Quality Control Review

All three documents should be understood as referencing the RFP Section 4.1 standard.
