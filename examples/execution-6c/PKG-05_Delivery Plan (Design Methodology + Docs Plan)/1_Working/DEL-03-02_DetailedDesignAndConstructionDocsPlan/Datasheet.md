### Design Constraints
- **Site constraints:** 12-acre developable area; flood fringe considerations; existing grading/utilities context
- **Program requirements:** Functional program (Appendix B of RFP); Owner Statement of Requirements (Appendix A)
- **Code compliance:** Alberta Building Code, fire code, accessibility standards
- **Addenda integration:** Addendum 03 clarifications (overhead door heights, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, solar-ready provisions, etc.)

*Source: Decomposition Section 4 (Addendum 03 impacts), Section 3 (hard constraints); specific code references from RFP Appendix A — location TBD*

### Limiting Conditions
- **Approval authority:** Town of Penhold retains design approval at key milestones
- **Permit jurisdiction:** Local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) for building permit
- **Timeline:** Driven by overall project schedule (DEL-08-01) and RFP submission deadline context (proposal phase complete by Aug 30, 2024)
- **Coordination dependencies:** Site survey files provided after award per Addendum 03; existing condition verification during DD phase

*Source: Decomposition Section 4 (Addendum 03), SOW-024; RFP contract terms — location TBD*

## Construction (Plan Production Process)

### Document Generation Workflow (ASSUMPTION: typical process)
1. **Discipline design development:** Each consultant produces deliverables per scope
2. **Internal QA/QC:** Discipline lead reviews for completeness and code compliance
3. **Interdisciplinary coordination:** Clash detection (BIM), overlay reviews, interface verification
4. **Design Manager consolidation:** Assemble complete set for milestone review
5. **Owner review cycle:** Submit for Owner comments; incorporate feedback
6. **Revision and reissue:** Track revisions; issue updated sets with revision marks
7. **Final issue for permit/construction:** Coordinated, sealed drawings per regulatory requirements

*Source: ASSUMPTION (industry standard workflow); specific process requirements from RFP Section 7.1.8 — location TBD*

### Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) Checkpoints (ASSUMPTION)

> **[SL:B-004]** Terminology standardized: QA (Quality Assurance) = upstream verification that requirements will be/are being met; QC (Quality Control) = downstream validation that work meets specifications. Both layers are required. *(SourcePath: Datasheet.md § Quality Assurance Checkpoints vs. Guidance.md § P-04 / Specification.md § RQ-03)*

**QA Layer (Upstream Verification):**
- **Drawing completeness check:** All sheets numbered, titled, dated; cover sheet index complete
- **Cross-discipline consistency review:** Design Manager verifies scope alignment across disciplines

**QC Layer (Downstream Validation):**
- **Code compliance review:** Third-party or internal code specialist review at DD and CD phases
- **Constructability review:** Construction Manager input on means/methods, sequencing, details
- **Cost estimate alignment:** Estimator verification that design aligns with budget (Appendix H baseline)

**Owner Validation:**
- **Owner acceptance signoff:** Formal acceptance at phase gates before proceeding

> **[SL:B-002]** Each QA/QC step must produce documented evidence. Evidence standard: signed checklist or dated review memo with reviewer identification. *(SourcePath: Datasheet.md § Construction / Document Generation Workflow vs. Specification.md § RQ-03)*

*Source: ASSUMPTION (typical QA/QC structure); specific QA/QC requirements from RFP Section 7.1.8 or quality management expectations — location TBD*

### Coordination Tools (ASSUMPTION)
- **BIM coordination:** 3D modeling for structural/MEP clash detection
- **Drawing overlay reviews:** 2D CAD overlay checks for site/civil coordination
- **Specification coordination:** CSI MasterFormat specs aligned with drawings
- **RFI/submittal tracking:** Log system for construction-phase information requests and submittals

*Source: ASSUMPTION (contemporary practice); Owner requirements or preferred platforms from RFP Section 7.1.8 — location TBD*

### Team Competency Framework (ASSUMPTION)

> **[SL:D-005]** Authoritative competence framework defines required qualifications for key roles to demonstrate credibility. Cross-reference Appendix I (team credentials) and DEL-07-02 (key resumes). *(SourcePath: Datasheet.md § Procedure / Team Readiness)*

| Role | Minimum Competency Requirements (ASSUMPTION) |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Design Manager** | 5+ years Design-Build experience; prior municipal/public facility background preferred; registered professional or licensed architect/engineer |
| **Discipline Leads** | Licensed professional in discipline; 3+ years experience in facility type (Fire Hall/public works preferred) |
| **Code Reviewer** | Building code specialist certification or demonstrated code review experience (Alberta jurisdiction) |
| **BIM Coordinator** | 2+ years BIM coordination experience; proficiency in coordination software (Navisworks or equivalent) |
| **Document Controller** | Experience with construction document management systems; familiarity with revision control protocols |

*Source: ASSUMPTION based on typical Design-Build competency requirements; specific credential requirements from Appendix I or RFP evaluation criteria — location TBD*
