## Upstream (I need these before I can proceed)

- DEL-03-01 (Design Methodology Narrative) — coordination interface; process descriptions must be consistent
- DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) — prerequisite; document production milestones must align with overall project schedule
- DEL-07-03 (Appendix I Subtrade and Consultant List) — prerequisite; identifies which disciplines/consultants are responsible for which scopes
- DEL-05-01 / DEL-05-02 (Pricing Summary / Cost Breakdown) — interface; budget baseline required for design cost estimate alignment (DD: ±10%, CD: ±5%)
- DEL-09-01 (Risk Register and Mitigation Plan) — interface; mobilization risks cross-referenced
- RFP Section 7.1.8 — governing requirement document
- Addendum 03 — required scope input (overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, solar-ready provisions, room sizing)

## Downstream (These need me)

- DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission Package) — DEL-03-02 plan document is incorporated into the proposal PDF at Step A-11
- DEL-06-01 (Commissioning, Closeout, Warranty Narrative) — IFC document set produced under this plan serves as the baseline for as-built markups; DEL-06-01 receives record drawings from this plan's execution

## Downstream Handoff Notes

> ConsumerContext: TASK_ESTIMATING

**Blocking dependencies (EstimateImpactClass = BLOCKING):**

- **DEP-03-02-001** (ANCHOR to PKG-05): Structural anchor confirming deliverable belongs to the correct work package. Required for any effort allocation.
- **DEP-03-02-002** (ANCHOR to SOW-018): Scope item anchor. Estimating scope for DEL-03-02 is bounded by SOW-018 ("Provide plan for detailed design and construction documents: coordination, QA/QC, issue cycles").
- **DEP-03-02-005** (PREREQUISITE on DEL-08-01): The plan document cannot finalize its milestone alignment table (Step A-09) without DEL-08-01 being available. If DEL-08-01 is not yet produced, estimate a placeholder duration for milestone alignment work.
- **DEP-03-02-007** (HANDOVER to DEL-01-02): DEL-03-02 output is a direct input to DEL-01-02. Handover is a hard gate; DEL-01-02 cannot be assembled without this deliverable.
- **DEP-03-02-012** (INTERFACE on Addendum 03): Addendum 03 integration (RQ-08, Step A-08) is an explicit requirement. Estimating must account for the addenda integration checklist artifact.

**Advisory dependencies (EstimateImpactClass = ADVISORY):**

- **DEP-03-02-004** (INTERFACE on DEL-03-01): Coordination with DEL-03-01 for process consistency. If DEL-03-01 is being produced concurrently, budget rework iterations for consistency alignment.
- **DEP-03-02-006** (PREREQUISITE on DEL-07-03): Appendix I must be available for discipline scope mapping. If not available, discipline scope assumptions will need to be flagged.
- **DEP-03-02-009** (INTERFACE on DEL-05-01): Budget baseline needed for post-award design cost estimate alignment. Not a gate for proposal production but becomes blocking for operational execution.
- **DEP-03-02-010** (INTERFACE on DEL-09-01): Risk register cross-reference for mobilization risks. Advisory for estimating; mobilization risk items may affect schedule assumptions.

## Run Notes

**Run date:** 2026-02-18
**Mode:** UPDATE (overwrite existing _DEPENDENCIES.md and Dependencies.csv)
**Strictness:** CONSERVATIVE
**Agent type:** TYPE 2 — DEPENDENCIES
**Schema version written:** v3.1

**Inputs used:**
- ANCHOR_DOC: `Datasheet.md` (primary anchor source; highest-confidence definition doc by heuristic)
- EXECUTION_DOCS (in order): `Procedure.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md`
- DECOMPOSITION_PATH: `/Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/chirality-app-test/test/execution-6c/_Decomposition/Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md`
- Decomposition status: FOUND AND READ — anchor validation performed successfully

**Defaults recorded:**
- SOURCE_DOCS: AUTO (all files in deliverable folder scanned; `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `Dependencies.csv`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`, `_STATUS.md` excluded as non-source)
- DOC_ROLE_MAP: DEFAULT heuristic applied
- EXECUTION_DOC_ORDER: AUTO (Procedure.md ranked highest for workflow signal; Specification.md second; Guidance.md third)
- CONSUMER_CONTEXT: TASK_ESTIMATING (inferred from invoker context; downstream handoff notes included)

**Decomposition resolution notes:**
- PKG-05 validated: Section 7 of decomposition explicitly lists DEL-03-02 as a primary deliverable of PKG-05.
- SOW-018 validated: Section 9 (Scope Ledger) row SOW-018 maps to DEL-03-02, PKG-05, OBJ-002.
- OBJ-002 validated: Section 6 defines OBJ-002 as "Maximize Project Delivery Plan score."
- All EXECUTION deliverable targets (DEL-03-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-07-03, DEL-01-02, DEL-06-01, DEL-05-01, DEL-09-01) confirmed in decomposition Section 8.

**Assumptions and decisions:**
- DEP-03-02-009 targets DEL-05-01 as the representative budget-baseline deliverable (DEL-05-01/02 named together in source; DEL-05-01 used as primary target since it is the Schedule A summary; DEL-05-02 is the cost breakdown companion — ASSUMPTION that DEL-05-01 is the primary baseline reference).
- DEP-03-02-008 (DEL-06-01 ENABLES) classified as DOWNSTREAM/ENABLES: the source states DEL-03-02's IFC set "serves as the baseline for as-built markups" and Step B-16 references DEL-06-01 for receiving those markups. This is a downstream information transfer, not a coordination-only relationship.
- No same-stage dependencies emitted without explicit information/asset transfer language in source text (CONSERVATIVE).
- _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md and _SEMANTIC.md read for context but no additional dependency signals extracted beyond those found in the primary source documents.

**Warnings:**
- None. All quality checks passed.
