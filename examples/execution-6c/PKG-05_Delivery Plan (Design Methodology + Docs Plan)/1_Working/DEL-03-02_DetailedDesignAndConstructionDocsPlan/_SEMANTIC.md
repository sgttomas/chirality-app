# Deliverable: DEL-03-02 Detailed Design and Construction Docs Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable governs how detailed design and construction documents are produced, coordinated, quality-checked, and controlled across all disciplines from design development through issued-for-construction. It must carry the knowledge of how document completeness, interdisciplinary coordination, and version control are systematically ensured throughout the design lifecycle.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**
- _CONTEXT.md — DEL-03-02 identity, scope traceability (SOW-018, OBJ-002), acceptance criteria
- _STATUS.md — Current state: INITIALIZED (2026-02-04)
- Datasheet.md — Discipline attributes, design phases, document control attributes, QA checkpoints, coordination tools
- Specification.md — RQ-01 through RQ-10 (completeness, coordination, QA/QC, document control, Owner review, discipline scope, code compliance, addenda integration, drawing/spec coordination, issuance protocols)
- Guidance.md — Principles P-01 through P-06, considerations (phase pacing, BIM vs 2D, Owner review duration, code review, permit coordination, as-built), trade-offs T-01 through T-03
- Procedure.md — Part A (proposal production steps A-01 through A-11), Part B (post-award operational steps B-01 through B-16), verification checkpoints, records
- _REFERENCES.md — RFP Section 7.1.8, Addendum 03
