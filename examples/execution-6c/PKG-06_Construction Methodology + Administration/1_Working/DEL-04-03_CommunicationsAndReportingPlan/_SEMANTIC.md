# Deliverable: DEL-04-03 Communications and Reporting Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** The Communications and Reporting Plan exists to structure how project information flows among stakeholders, ensuring that decision-making authority, reporting obligations, and coordination protocols are defined before work begins. It must carry knowledge of who communicates what, when, and through which channels across the full project lifecycle, so that transparency, accountability, and timely responsiveness are maintained between the Design-Builder and the municipal Owner.
