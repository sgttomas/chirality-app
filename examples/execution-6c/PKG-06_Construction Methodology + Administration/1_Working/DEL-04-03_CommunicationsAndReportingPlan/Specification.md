# Specification: DEL-04-03 Communications and Reporting Plan

## Scope

### In Scope

This Communications and Reporting Plan covers:

1. **Communication protocols** between Design-Builder and Owner (Town of Penhold) during design and construction phases
2. **Meeting structure** for design progress, construction progress, commissioning coordination, and project closeout
3. **Reporting cadence** including progress reports, meeting minutes, change order logs, RFI logs, and safety reports
4. **Stakeholder identification** and communication touchpoints for all project participants
5. **Escalation paths** for critical decisions, safety incidents, and schedule/budget impacts
6. **Subconsultant and subtrade coordination** communications (internal to Design-Builder team, with Owner visibility as required)

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (deliverable description); Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, Section 8 DEL-04-03 (acceptance criteria).

---

### Out of Scope

This plan does **not** cover:

1. **Public communications** or media relations (retained by Owner)
2. **Owner's internal communications** within Town of Penhold departments
3. **Subconsultant/subtrade internal communications** (Design-Builder manages these internally; plan addresses interface with Owner only)
4. **Post-warranty communications** (plan covers project delivery through warranty period only)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on typical Design-Build contract boundaries; specific exclusions location TBD in RFP.

## Requirements

### REQ-COMM-001: Communication Roles and Responsibilities

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall clearly define:
- The Design-Builder's primary point of contact for Owner communications: **Construction Manager** (per _CONTEXT.md responsible party designation)
- The Owner's designated representative for project communications
- The roles and responsibilities of all project team members in the communication structure
- The escalation authority for decisions exceeding site-level resolution
- **Plan governance authority:** Who has authority to approve changes to the communications plan itself (meeting frequency adjustments, reporting requirement modifications)

**Rationale:** Single point of responsibility is a core Design-Build principle; role clarity prevents communication breakdowns and decision delays. Plan governance authority (D-001) ensures meta-governance: authority over the plan, not just within it.

**Acceptance Threshold (A-004):** Roles documented with named positions; escalation paths defined with specific contact hierarchy; no ambiguity in primary contact designation.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on Design-Build delivery model (Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, Section 2); _CONTEXT.md (responsible party: Construction Manager). [Ref: _REFERENCES.md, RFP Section 7.3.4 — PDF not accessible]

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 2).

**Enrichment Source:** Items A-002, A-004, D-001 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix A: normative:guiding, normative:judging; Matrix D: normative:guiding).

---

### REQ-COMM-002: Meeting Cadence and Structure

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall specify:
- Meeting types (kickoff, design progress, construction progress, commissioning coordination)
- Meeting frequency (minimum frequencies for each phase)
- Standard agenda structure for each meeting type
- Attendee lists (roles, not necessarily names at proposal stage)
- Meeting minutes distribution protocol

**Rationale:** Regular, structured meetings ensure alignment between Design-Builder and Owner throughout the project lifecycle.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on municipal construction project norms; specific RFP requirement location TBD.

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 3).

---

### REQ-COMM-003: Progress Reporting

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall include:
- Monthly written progress reports covering:
  - Schedule status (milestones achieved, upcoming milestones, critical path items)
  - Budget status (committed costs, forecast at completion, variance analysis)
  - Quality and safety metrics (incidents, inspections, non-conformances)
  - Risk and issue register updates
  - Change order status
- Distribution list and delivery method for progress reports
- Report format and template (to be finalized during kickoff)
- **Performance target (A-008):** 95% of monthly reports delivered by 5th business day of following month

**Rationale:** Transparent reporting builds Owner confidence and enables proactive decision-making. Measurable performance target enables objective assessment of communications plan execution.

**Acceptance Threshold (A-004):** Report template includes all required sections; distribution list documented; delivery method specified; on-time delivery rate tracked.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on municipal project reporting norms. [Ref: _REFERENCES.md, RFP Section 7.3.4 — PDF not accessible]

---

### REQ-COMM-004: Change Management Communication

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall address:
- Change order proposal process (written proposals with scope, cost, and schedule impact)
- Change order log maintenance and distribution
- Owner approval workflow and decision timelines
- Communication of approved changes to all affected parties (design team, trades, inspectors)

**Rationale:** Transparent change management prevents disputes and maintains budget/schedule control.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on construction contract norms; specific RFP requirement location TBD (likely in Section 7.3 or contract terms).

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 5).

---

### REQ-COMM-005: Request for Information (RFI) Protocol

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall define:
- RFI submission process (format, routing, tracking)
- Response timelines for different RFI priority levels (routine vs. critical path)
- RFI log maintenance and access for Owner review
- Escalation process for overdue RFIs affecting schedule

**Rationale:** Timely RFI resolution is critical to maintaining design and construction momentum.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on construction project coordination norms; specific RFP requirement location TBD.

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 6).

---

### REQ-COMM-006: Safety and Emergency Communication

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall specify:

- Substantial completion and final acceptance communication protocols

**Rationale:** Successful commissioning and training require close coordination with end users; communication ensures operational readiness at turnover.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on commissioning process requirements (Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, PKG-07 Commissioning, Closeout & Warranty); specific RFP requirement location TBD (likely Section 7.3.6–7.3.7).

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 8).

---

### REQ-COMM-008: Subconsultant and Subtrade Coordination

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall describe:
- How Design-Builder manages communications with subconsultants and subtrades
- Owner visibility into subconsultant coordination (e.g., through progress reports or meeting summaries)
- Interface protocols when Owner needs direct interaction with specific disciplines (e.g., fire protection specialist)

**Rationale:** Design-Builder maintains single point of responsibility, but Owner may need assurance of competent subconsultant coordination and occasional direct technical interaction.

**Source:** _REFERENCES.md (RFP Section 7.3.4 subconsultant approach); Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, SOW-021 (subconsultant approach narrative); specific requirement location TBD in RFP.

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 9).

- Decision log (key design and construction decisions with rationale and date)
- Action item review cadence (e.g., standing agenda item in progress meetings)
- Escalation process for overdue action items affecting critical path

**Rationale:** Formal decision tracking ensures accountability and prevents decisions from being forgotten or misunderstood.

**Acceptance Threshold (A-004):** Register template provided; decision log template provided; review cadence specified; escalation thresholds defined (days overdue before escalation).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on project management best practices. [Ref: _REFERENCES.md, RFP Section 7.3.4 — PDF not accessible]

**Verification:** Document review (see Procedure.md, Step 11).

---

### REQ-COMM-011: Cyclic Plan Compliance Review (X-006)

**Requirement:** The Communications Plan shall include provisions for periodic review of plan compliance during project execution, including:
- Quarterly review of communications effectiveness (meeting frequency adherence, report timeliness, escalation path functionality)
- Post-phase review after design-to-construction transition
- Mechanism for plan adjustments based on review findings (subject to plan governance authority per REQ-COMM-001)

**Rationale:** Cyclic compliance assurance requires recurring verification, not just initial document review. The plan must include mechanisms to assess whether it is being followed during execution.

**Acceptance Threshold:** Review cadence documented; review criteria defined; adjustment mechanism specified.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on project management feedback loop principles.

**Verification:** Document review.

**Enrichment Source:** Items A-005, X-006 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix A: normative:reviewing; Matrix X: reviewing:necessity).
