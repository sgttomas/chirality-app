### Stakeholder Register

| Stakeholder Group | Role/Interest | Communication Needs | Primary Contact Point |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Town of Penhold (Owner)** | Project sponsor, decision authority, end user | Regular progress updates, decision requests, budget/schedule transparency | Owner representative (to be designated post-award) |
| **Design-Builder Project Manager** | Overall project accountability, coordination hub | Internal team coordination, Owner interface, subconsultant management | Design-Builder PM |
| **Design Leads (Architect, Engineers)** | Design development, code compliance, constructability | Design review meetings, RFI responses, submittal coordination | Discipline leads (to be named in proposal) |
| **Construction Manager / Site Superintendent** | Field execution, safety, quality, schedule | Daily site coordination, progress reporting, issue escalation | Construction Manager |
| **Subconsultants / Subtrades** | Specialized design and construction scopes | Work coordination, submittal schedules, safety protocols | Construction Manager (primary interface) |
| **Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)** | Building permits, inspections, code compliance | Permit applications, inspection coordination, code clarifications | Design-Builder PM (permit coordination) |
| **Town Fire Department Operations Staff** | End users (Fire apparatus bays, training facilities), emergency service operational requirements | Design input (apparatus dimensions, response time needs), commissioning participation (24/7 operational considerations), equipment training | Owner representative (coordination through); requires 24/7 communication capability during commissioning |
| **Town Public Works Operations Staff** | End users (vehicle storage, maintenance bays, administrative), fleet/equipment operational requirements | Design input (vehicle sizing, maintenance needs), commissioning participation (business hours typically sufficient), systems training | Owner representative (coordination through) |

**Note:** Fire Department and Public Works staff are differentiated due to distinct operational communication needs: Fire operations require 24/7 communication capability and emergency-service-specific coordination, while Public Works typically operates during standard business hours.

### Key Term Definition: Owner Representative (E-002)

**Owner representative** — The individual designated by the Town of Penhold to serve as the primary point of contact for all project communications between the Owner and Design-Builder. Designation to be confirmed post-award. The Owner representative has authority to: (a) receive and acknowledge progress reports; (b) participate in project meetings; (c) submit RFIs and receive responses; (d) approve or escalate change orders per delegated authority; (e) serve as escalation target for Construction Manager when issues exceed site-level resolution. When unavailable, the Owner representative shall designate a backup authority.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on typical Design-Build stakeholder structure; specific names and contact information to be populated post-award. [Ref: _REFERENCES.md, RFP Section 7.3.4 — PDF not accessible]

**Enrichment Source:** Items B-005, E-002 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix B: information:completeness — comprehensive understanding; Matrix E: normative:consistency — enduring systematic coherence).

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Tracking Frequency |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **RFI Response Timeliness** | 95% of RFIs responded within stated timelines (7 days routine, 3 days critical, 24 hours emergency) | RFI log analysis | Monthly |
| **Meeting Minutes Timeliness** | 100% of meeting minutes distributed within 24 hours | Meeting minutes timestamp | Per meeting |
| **Progress Report On-Time Delivery** | 100% of monthly reports delivered by 5th business day of following month | Report delivery log | Monthly |
| **Action Item Closure Rate** | 90% of action items closed by due date | Action item register analysis | Monthly |

## Conditions

### Operating Context

- **Project Delivery Model:** Design-Build (single point of responsibility)
- **Project Type:** Municipal facility (Fire Hall + Public Works integrated building)
- **Owner:** Town of Penhold (small municipality)
- **Submission Context:** Proposal evaluation criteria include "Project Delivery Plan" (10 points out of 100)
- **Proposal Scoring Sub-weight (D-006):** **TBD** — The specific scoring weight attributable to the Communications Plan within the 10-point "Project Delivery Plan" category is not specified in accessible materials. [Pending: RFP evaluation criteria details]

**Source:** Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, Section 2 (Intake Summary), Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk).

**Enrichment Source:** Item D-006 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix D: evaluative:judging — definitive value determination).

---

### Normal Conditions

- **Design Phase Communications:** Regular design progress meetings (proposed: bi-weekly); Owner input on functional requirements; design review and approval cycles
- **Construction Phase Communications:** Construction progress meetings (proposed: weekly); written progress reports (proposed: monthly); real-time issue escalation for critical path or safety impacts
- **Change Management Communications:** Transparent change order process with written proposals, cost/schedule impact documentation, and Owner approval before execution
- **Closeout Communications:** Commissioning coordination; training scheduling; deficiency tracking; warranty documentation handover

**Note (F-009):** Meeting and report frequencies stated as "proposed" pending Owner confirmation at kickoff. This harmonizes frequency language across the Datasheet to maintain consistent confidence characterization.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on standard Design-Build project lifecycle; specific protocols subject to Owner preferences and contract requirements. [Ref: _REFERENCES.md, RFP Section 7.3.4 — PDF not accessible]

**Enrichment Source:** Item F-009 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix F: evaluative:consistency — impartial effectiveness discipline).

---

### Limiting Conditions

- **Owner Availability:** Communications plan must accommodate Town staff availability (small municipality may have limited dedicated project oversight capacity)
- **Critical Decision Timelines:** Design and construction milestones require timely Owner decisions; communication protocols must include decision escalation paths to avoid schedule impacts
- **Subconsultant Coordination:** Design-Builder is responsible for coordinating all subconsultants and subtrades; Owner communications are channeled through Design-Builder PM to maintain single point of responsibility
- **Confidentiality and Public Communications:** Owner retains authority over public communications about the project; Design-Builder may not issue public statements without Owner approval

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on Design-Build contract norms and municipal procurement practices; specific contract requirements location TBD in RFP.
