# Guidance: DEL-04-03 Communications and Reporting Plan

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists

The Communications and Reporting Plan exists to:

1. **Establish trust and transparency** between the Design-Builder and the Town of Penhold, demonstrating proactive communication practices that align with municipal accountability expectations.
2. **Prevent miscommunication and decision delays** by defining clear roles, meeting cadences, and escalation paths before project work begins.
3. **Support proposal evaluation** by addressing RFP Section 7.3.4 requirements and contributing to the "Project Delivery Plan" evaluation category (10 points out of 100).
4. **Provide a roadmap for project execution** that can be refined during the kickoff meeting and adapted as the project progresses.

## Principles

### Underlying Engineering Rationale

#### Principle 1: Single Point of Responsibility (Design-Build Model)

**Canonical Statement (B-010):** In a Design-Build delivery model, the Design-Builder maintains single point of responsibility for all design and construction activities. The Owner communicates exclusively through the Design-Builder's designated representative (Construction Manager, per _CONTEXT.md) for all project matters. This single-point-of-responsibility principle ensures clarity, accountability, and prevents fragmented communication that could lead to errors, disputes, or decision delays.

**Rationale:** All communications with subconsultants, subtrades, and suppliers are managed internally by the Design-Builder. The Owner communicates with the Design-Builder's designated representative to maintain clarity and accountability.

**Implication:** The Communications Plan must clearly designate the Design-Builder's primary contact (Construction Manager) and describe how subconsultant coordination occurs "behind the scenes" while giving the Owner confidence that coordination is effective.

**Enrichment Source:** Item B-010 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix B: wisdom:consistency — principled integrity). This principle serves as the canonical statement for single-point-of-responsibility language used across all four documents.

---

#### Principle 2: Proactive Transparency Builds Trust

**Rationale:** Municipal owners value transparency because public funds are at stake and community stakeholders expect accountability. Proactive reporting (regular progress updates, early flagging of risks, transparent change management) builds Owner confidence and reduces adversarial dynamics.

**Implication:** The Communications Plan should emphasize frequent, structured reporting even when there are no major issues. Monthly progress reports, weekly construction meetings, and real-time escalation of critical issues demonstrate commitment to transparency.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on municipal procurement norms and public accountability expectations.

---

#### Principle 3: Right Level of Detail for the Right Audience

**Rationale:** Different stakeholders need different levels of detail. Owner representatives need high-level status and decision points; design leads need technical coordination details; site trades need daily work instructions. Overloading any audience with irrelevant detail reduces communication effectiveness.

**Implication:** The Communications Plan should tailor communication artifacts to the audience: executive summaries for Owner leadership, detailed technical coordination for design team, daily toolbox talks for site crews.

**Minimum Information Thresholds by Stakeholder (B-004):**

| Stakeholder | Minimum Information Required | Frequency |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| **Owner representative** | Project status (green/yellow/red), budget variance >5%, schedule variance >1 week, pending decisions, safety incidents | Monthly (report) + as-needed (incidents, decisions) |
| **Town Fire Operations** | Design decisions affecting apparatus operations, commissioning schedule, training dates, operational handover timeline | Per phase milestone + commissioning phase (weekly) |
| **Town Public Works Operations** | Design decisions affecting maintenance/storage functions, commissioning schedule, training dates, operational handover timeline | Per phase milestone + commissioning phase (weekly) |
| **Design-Builder PM** | All project information (comprehensive awareness) | Continuous |
| **Subconsultants** | Scope-relevant decisions, schedule impacts, coordination requirements | As-needed + coordination meetings |

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on PMI/PMBOK stakeholder communications principles.

**Enrichment Source:** Item B-004 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix B: information:necessity — required awareness).

---

#### Principle 4: Timely Decisions Prevent Schedule Impacts

**Rationale:** Design-Build projects move quickly, and decision delays can cascade into schedule and cost impacts. Clear communication protocols with defined response timelines (e.g., RFI turnaround, change order approval) keep the project on track.

**Implication:** The Communications Plan should include decision timelines and escalation paths for overdue decisions. If the Owner representative is unavailable, the plan should identify a backup decision authority.

**Procedural Steering Mechanism (A-006):**
- **Decision timeout trigger:** If no response received within stated timeline (e.g., 7 days for routine RFI), automatic escalation to backup authority
- **Escalation threshold:** Owner representative non-response for 3+ consecutive items triggers escalation to Town leadership
- **Backup authority identification:** Owner to designate backup decision authority at kickoff; if not designated, escalation defaults to Town CAO or designate

**Enrichment Source:** Item A-006 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix A: operative:guiding — procedural steering).

---

#### Principle 5: Document Everything (Risk Mitigation)

**Rationale:** Construction projects are legally complex, and disputes often hinge on "who said what, when." Formal documentation (meeting minutes, decision logs, change order records, RFI logs) protects both parties and provides a factual record if disagreements arise.

**Implication:** The Communications Plan should mandate written documentation for all key decisions and communications, with version control and distribution protocols.

## Considerations

### Factors to Weigh During Plan Execution

#### Owner Capacity and Availability

**Consideration:** The Town of Penhold is a small municipality. The Owner's designated representative may have other responsibilities and limited bandwidth for intensive project oversight.

**How to Address:**
- Propose a communication structure that is regular but not overly burdensome (e.g., monthly reports rather than weekly; concise executive summaries).
- Offer flexibility in meeting formats (in-person vs. video call) and timing (accommodate Town staff schedules).
- Provide clear decision points with sufficient lead time so the Owner can prepare and respond without feeling rushed.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on small-municipality context (Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, Section 1 Intake Summary: Town of Penhold as Owner).

---

#### Design-Build Team Coordination Complexity

**Consideration:** The Design-Build team includes multiple disciplines (architecture, structural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, civil/site) and numerous subtrades. Coordinating this team while maintaining a unified interface to the Owner requires discipline.

**How to Address:**
- Establish internal coordination meetings (separate from Owner meetings) to resolve design/construction issues before presenting to Owner.
- Designate a single point of contact for Owner communications (Construction Manager or PM) to filter and consolidate information.
- Use shared project management tools (RFI logs, change order logs, action item registers) to track internal coordination and provide Owner visibility without overwhelming them with detail.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on Design-Build team structure (Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, Section 7 PKG-03 Team Qualifications, PKG-06 Construction Methodology).

---

#### Commissioning and End-User Engagement

**Consideration:** The building serves two distinct user groups (Fire Department and Public Works). Effective commissioning and training require direct engagement with operations staff, which may necessitate more frequent communication during the commissioning phase.

**Operational Communication Differences (F-008):**
- **Fire Department:** Emergency service operations require 24/7 communication capability during commissioning; training coordination must account for shift schedules and minimum staffing requirements; apparatus bay commissioning may require coordination with mutual aid agreements during testing
- **Public Works:** Typically operates during standard business hours; commissioning coordination can generally follow normal meeting schedules; fleet/equipment commissioning less time-critical than emergency services

**How to Address:**
- Plan for increased communication frequency during commissioning (e.g., weekly coordination meetings with Fire and Public Works staff).
- Schedule training sessions well in advance and confirm attendance to avoid delays in substantial completion.
- Use commissioning reports and deficiency tracking to maintain transparency and ensure all systems are fully functional at turnover.
- Establish separate communication protocols for Fire (24/7 capable) and Public Works (business hours) during commissioning phase.

**Enrichment Source:** Item F-008 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix F: evaluative:completeness — authoritative impact comprehension).

---

#### Regulatory and Permit Coordination

**Consideration:** The project requires building permits and inspections from Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). Permit delays or failed inspections can impact the schedule, and the Owner expects to be kept informed.

**How to Address:**
- Include permit status and upcoming inspection milestones in monthly progress reports.
- Notify Owner immediately if a permit delay or inspection failure occurs, along with the mitigation plan.
- Maintain a permit and inspection log as part of the overall project documentation.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on construction permitting norms. [Ref: _REFERENCES.md, RFP Section 7.3.4 — PDF not accessible]

---

#### Cross-Deliverable Communication Integration (B-009)

**Consideration:** This Communications Plan must coordinate with communication requirements embedded in other deliverables. Communication is not isolated to DEL-04-03; it is a cross-cutting concern.

**Adjacent Deliverable Communication Requirements:**
- **DEL-04-02 (Budget Control and Change Management Plan):** Change communication protocols must align; progress report budget sections must use consistent data sources and formats
- **DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative):** Construction phase communication cadence must align with construction methodology milestones
- **DEL-03-01 (Design Methodology Narrative):** Design phase communication cadence must align with design development phases
- **DEL-06-01 (Commissioning, Training, Closeout, Warranty Narrative):** Commissioning communication protocols must align with commissioning procedures; training scheduling must align with training plan

**How to Address:**
- Cross-reference adjacent deliverables during plan development (see Procedure.md, Step 13)
- Verify consistency of meeting frequencies, reporting cadences, and artifact definitions across deliverables
- Use this Communications Plan as the authoritative source for communication protocols; other deliverables reference this plan rather than duplicating content

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on integrated deliverable coordination requirements.

**Enrichment Source:** Item B-009 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix B: wisdom:completeness — holistic insight).

---

#### Quality Assurance of Communication Outputs (C-007)

**Consideration:** Communication artifacts (progress reports, meeting minutes, change order logs) carry project-critical information. Errors in these artifacts can lead to misunderstandings, disputes, or incorrect decisions.

**How to Address:**
- Progress reports reviewed by Design-Builder PM before distribution to Owner
- Meeting minutes reviewed by meeting organizer and Construction Manager before distribution
- Change order cost/schedule data verified against source documents before inclusion in logs
- Fact-checking protocol: data in reports must be current within 5 business days of report date

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on quality management principles.

**Enrichment Source:** Item C-007 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix C: evaluative:necessity — impact-conscious quality assurance).

## Trade-offs

### Competing Concerns in Communications Planning

#### Trade-off 1: Frequency vs. Burden

**Tension:** More frequent communication (e.g., weekly progress meetings) provides tighter control and faster issue resolution, but increases time burden on both Owner and Design-Builder.

**Value Hierarchy (A-010):** When frequency conflicts with burden, the following priority order applies:
1. **Safety communication** — never reduced; immediate notification always required
2. **Decision-blocking communication** — prioritized to prevent schedule impacts
3. **Transparency communication** — maintained at minimum monthly cadence
4. **Relationship communication** — can be adjusted based on Owner preference

**Default Position (D-005):** Start with a moderate cadence (monthly written reports, bi-weekly design meetings, weekly construction meetings). This is a committed default, not indefinitely deferred. Adjustments require mutual agreement documented in meeting minutes.

**Recommendation:** Offer flexibility to increase frequency during critical phases (e.g., design milestones, permitting, commissioning). Reductions below default require Owner written approval.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on project communications best practices.

**Enrichment Source:** Items A-010, D-005 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix A: evaluative:guiding — value orientation; Matrix D: evaluative:guiding — decisive priority commitment).

---

#### Trade-off 2: Detail vs. Clarity

**Tension:** Detailed reports (e.g., full schedule Gantt charts, line-item budget breakdowns) provide comprehensive information but can overwhelm non-technical Owner representatives. High-level summaries are easier to digest but may omit critical details.

**Recommendation:** Use layered reporting: executive summary (1 page) with key status indicators (red/yellow/green), followed by detailed sections for those who want deeper analysis. Provide access to detailed logs (RFI, change orders) but don't require Owner to read them unless issues arise.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on PMI/PMBOK communications best practices.

---

#### Trade-off 3: Formal vs. Informal Communication

**Tension:** Formal communication (written reports, documented meeting minutes) creates a clear record and supports accountability, but can feel rigid and slow. Informal communication (phone calls, site visits, casual conversations) is faster and builds relationships, but lacks documentation.

**Recommendation:** Use both. Establish formal channels for decisions, approvals, and issue escalation (written change orders, meeting minutes). Use informal channels for day-to-day coordination and relationship-building (site visits, phone calls), but follow up important decisions with written confirmation.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on construction project relationship management norms.

---

#### Trade-off 4: Owner Involvement vs. Design-Builder Autonomy

**Tension:** The Owner wants visibility and input into design and construction decisions, but excessive Owner involvement can slow the project and undermine the Design-Build model's efficiency.

**Project-Specific Discernment (B-008):** For this project (Town of Penhold, small municipality, first major integrated facility project), the recommended balance point is:
- **Higher Owner involvement:** Design decisions affecting operational functionality (apparatus bay dimensions, maintenance bay layout, office configurations); significant aesthetic decisions (exterior finishes, public-facing interior finishes); budget decisions >$10,000 impact
- **Design-Builder autonomy:** Technical coordination decisions; construction sequencing; minor design refinements within approved scope; decisions <$10,000 impact unless cumulative threshold exceeded
- **Rationale:** Small municipality with limited project oversight capacity benefits from clear decision gates rather than continuous involvement; first major facility project warrants Owner engagement on key functional decisions

**Recommendation:** Define clear decision gates where Owner input is required (e.g., design milestones, major cost changes, schedule adjustments) and trust the Design-Builder to manage day-to-day execution autonomously. Use progress reports and meetings to provide transparency without requiring Owner approval for routine decisions.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on Design-Build delivery model principles and small-municipality project context.

**Enrichment Source:** Item B-008 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix B: wisdom:necessity — critical discernment).

5. **Upcoming milestones and schedule** (5 min)
6. **New action items and responsible parties** (5 min)

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on typical design team meeting structure.

---

### Example 2: Monthly Progress Report Structure

**Purpose:** Consistent report format makes it easy for Owner to track status over time.

**Sample Report Sections:**
1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Overall project status (green/yellow/red)
   - Key accomplishments this month
   - Critical issues and mitigation actions
   - Upcoming milestones
2. **Schedule Status**
   - Milestones achieved vs. planned
   - Current critical path activities
   - Schedule risks and mitigation
3. **Budget Status**
   - Committed costs vs. budget
   - Forecast at completion
   - Variance analysis (if any)
4. **Quality and Safety**
   - Inspections completed
   - Safety incidents (if any)
   - Quality non-conformances (if any)
5. **Change Orders**
   - Pending change orders (scope, cost, schedule impact)
   - Approved change orders
6. **Risks and Issues**
   - Top 5 active risks and mitigation status
7. **Next Month's Focus**
   - Key activities planned
   - Owner decisions required

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on municipal construction project reporting norms.

### Example 3: RFI Escalation Process

**Purpose:** Ensure timely RFI responses to avoid schedule delays.

**Process:**
1. **Day 0:** Design-Builder submits RFI to Owner (via email or shared log).
2. **Day 3:** If no response, Design-Builder sends reminder.
3. **Day 7:** If no response, Design-Builder escalates to Owner's backup decision authority (identified in Communications Plan).
4. **Day 10:** If still no response and RFI is critical path, Design-Builder documents schedule impact and proposes interim solution or delay justification.

**Normative RFI Response Framework (F-005):** The Procedure.md Step 6 defines the normative RFI response timelines:
- **Routine RFIs:** 7 business days
- **Critical path RFIs:** 3 business days
- **Emergency RFIs:** 24 hours

This Example 3 illustrates the escalation process for a routine RFI. For critical path and emergency RFIs, escalation timelines are compressed proportionally. Procedure.md Step 6 is the authoritative source for response timelines; this example is illustrative.

**Enrichment Source:** Item F-005 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix F: operative:consistency — methodical coordination fidelity).

---

#### Communication Prioritization Under Conflict (D-003)

**Consideration:** Multiple communication demands may conflict (e.g., safety incident communication vs. scheduled progress meeting vs. Owner decision request, all competing for Construction Manager attention).

**Prioritization Rules:**
1. **Safety incidents** — Immediate priority; all other communication activities deferred until incident notification complete and situation stabilized
2. **Emergency RFIs / Stop-work events** — Second priority; Owner decision requests affecting active work
3. **Critical path decisions** — Third priority; decisions blocking schedule progress
4. **Scheduled meetings** — Fourth priority; may be rescheduled if higher-priority items require attention
5. **Routine reporting** — Fifth priority; may be delayed (not cancelled) if higher-priority items require attention

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on construction project priority management principles.

**Enrichment Source:** Item D-003 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix D: operative:guiding — settled workflow priority).

---

#### Requirements Justification (F-006)

**Consideration:** The specification includes 12 requirements (REQ-COMM-001 through REQ-COMM-012). This section provides rationale for why this set of requirements is both necessary and sufficient for the communications plan.

**Requirement Set Justification:**
- REQ-COMM-001 through REQ-COMM-010 address core communication functions: roles, meetings, reporting, changes, RFIs, safety, commissioning, subconsultants, documents, decisions
- REQ-COMM-011 (Cyclic Review) and REQ-COMM-012 (Operational Validation) address gaps identified during semantic lensing — operational compliance and Owner validation mechanisms
- **Potential gap noted:** No requirement explicitly addresses community/public communication coordination with the Owner. This is intentionally excluded as "Out of Scope" (public communications retained by Owner), but the boundary should be clearly communicated to the Owner.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on communications plan completeness analysis.

**Enrichment Source:** Item F-006 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix F: evaluative:necessity — critical effectiveness imperative).

---

#### Proposal Scoring Calibration (E-005)

**Consideration:** The communications plan contributes to the "Project Delivery Plan" evaluation category (10 points out of 100). Understanding how plan quality maps to scoring outcome would enable calibrated effort allocation.

**Current State:** The specific scoring sub-weight for communications is not available in accessible materials (marked TBD in Datasheet.md). Without this information, the plan is developed to a standard of completeness that would satisfy a reasonable evaluator, but effort calibration is not possible.

**Recommendation:** If scoring sub-weight becomes available before submission, reassess plan completeness against scoring expectations. If time permits, enhance areas of evaluator emphasis.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on proposal strategy principles.

**Enrichment Source:** Item E-005 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix E: evaluative:sufficiency — calibrated outcome validation).

---

#### Closeout Retrospection (X-008)

**Consideration:** At project closeout, communication effectiveness should be retrospectively assessed to capture lessons learned.

**How to Address:**
- Include communication effectiveness review as agenda item in closeout meeting (coordinate with PKG-07 DEL-07-01 Closeout procedures)
- Document what worked well and what could be improved in future projects
- Archive lessons learned in project records for Design-Builder organizational learning

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on project management lessons-learned principles.

**Enrichment Source:** Item X-008 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix X: reviewing:completeness — total governance retrospection).
