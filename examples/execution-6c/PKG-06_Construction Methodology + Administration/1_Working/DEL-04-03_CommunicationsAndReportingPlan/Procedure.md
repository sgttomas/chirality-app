### Communications Infrastructure Prerequisites (C-004)

Before the communications plan can be executed (post-award), the following infrastructure must be operationally ready:

| Infrastructure Component | Responsible Party | Target Ready Date | Verification Method |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Project portal / shared document platform | Design-Builder PM | Kickoff + 2 weeks | Platform accessible, permissions configured |
| Email distribution lists (project team, Owner contacts) | Design-Builder PM | Kickoff + 1 week | Test email to all lists successful |
| Shared drive / cloud storage | Design-Builder PM | Kickoff + 2 weeks | All team members can upload/download |
| Meeting minutes template | Construction Manager | Kickoff + 1 week | Template reviewed and approved |
| Progress report template | Construction Manager | Kickoff + 2 weeks | Template reviewed and approved |
| RFI log / Action item register templates | Construction Manager | Kickoff + 1 week | Templates reviewed and approved |

**Note:** This is an operational readiness prerequisite for plan execution, not for plan production. The plan can be produced (for proposal submission) without this infrastructure in place.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on communications infrastructure requirements.

**Enrichment Source:** Item C-004 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix C: operative:necessity — operational readiness baseline).

### Knowledge and Skills Required

- **Project management experience** with Design-Build delivery models
- **Municipal construction project communications** norms and expectations
- **Understanding of stakeholder analysis** and communication planning (PMI/PMBOK principles)
- **Familiarity with construction contract terms** (CCDC or similar) for change management and reporting obligations

**Competency Verification (B-007):** The plan author's competency in the above areas should be verified by the Design-Builder PM or senior project management staff before plan production begins. Verification may be demonstrated through:
- Documented experience on comparable projects (Design-Build, municipal construction)
- Professional credentials (PMP, P.Eng with project management experience)
- Organizational assignment by qualified superior

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on deliverable discipline (Project Management) and type (Plan Document).

**Enrichment Source:** Item B-007 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (Matrix B: knowledge:necessity — foundational competence).

## Steps

### Step 1: Review Project Context and Objectives

**Action:**
1. Read the decomposition document (Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md) to understand:
   - Project delivery model (Design-Build)
   - Owner (Town of Penhold, small municipality)
   - Facility type (integrated Fire Hall + Public Works)
   - Evaluation criteria (Project Delivery Plan = 10 points; team qualifications contribute to proposal score)
2. Read _CONTEXT.md to confirm deliverable scope, responsible party, and acceptance criteria.
3. Identify applicable objectives (OBJ-002: Maximize Project Delivery Plan score; OBJ-006: Demonstrate strong team).

**Verification:** Deliverable context and evaluation criteria are clearly understood.

**Source:** AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS.md, Step 1 (Read Context); _CONTEXT.md; Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_Final_AddendumIntegrated_v1.md, Section 6 (Objectives), Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria).

---

### Step 2: Define Communication Roles and Responsibilities (REQ-COMM-001)

**Action:**
1. Designate the Design-Builder's primary point of contact for Owner communications: **Construction Manager** (per _CONTEXT.md responsible party designation — this is the authoritative designation, not "typically" or "Project Manager or Construction Manager").
2. Identify the Owner's anticipated representative (to be confirmed post-award; use placeholder "Owner Representative" in proposal).
3. Define roles for all project team members in the communication structure:
   - Design-Builder PM: Overall coordination, Owner interface, subconsultant management
   - Construction Manager: Primary Owner contact, site-level communications, progress reporting, safety escalation
   - Design Leads: Technical coordination, RFI responses, design review participation
   - Subconsultants/Subtrades: Internal coordination (managed by Design-Builder per single-point-of-responsibility principle)
4. Establish escalation authority for decisions exceeding site-level resolution (e.g., Owner representative → Town leadership).
5. **(D-001)** Define plan governance authority: Construction Manager has authority to implement plan; Design-Builder PM must approve any changes to meeting frequencies, reporting requirements, or escalation paths.

**Verification:** Roles and escalation paths are clearly documented in the Communications Plan (see Specification.md, REQ-COMM-001).

**Source:** Specification.md, REQ-COMM-001; _CONTEXT.md (responsible party: Construction Manager).

**Action (Plan Activation - E-003):**
1. Upon project award, formally activate the Communications Plan:
   - Confirm all infrastructure prerequisites are met (see Communications Infrastructure Prerequisites above)
   - Issue activation notice: "The Communications and Reporting Plan (DEL-04-03) is now in effect as of [kickoff meeting date]"
   - Record activation date in plan revision history
2. Conduct kickoff meeting agenda items for communications:
   - Confirm Owner representative and backup authority
   - Confirm meeting frequencies (finalize "proposed" items)
   - Confirm communication platform selection
   - Review safety notification protocols and demonstrate 24/7 contact availability

**Action (Plan Transition - C-005):**
1. At project award, transition plan from "proposal mode" to "execution mode":
   - Replace all "proposed" frequency statements with confirmed frequencies (per kickoff decisions)
   - Replace all "TBD" infrastructure items with confirmed platforms/contacts
   - Update plan version to reflect post-award baseline
2. At design-to-construction transition:
   - Review communication cadences and adjust if needed
   - Confirm construction phase meeting attendees
   - Update plan version if changes made

**Action (Cyclic Review - D-004, A-005, A-009):**
1. Conduct quarterly communications plan compliance review:
   - Review KPI performance (from Datasheet: RFI response timeliness, meeting minutes timeliness, etc.)
   - Assess whether plan is being followed
   - Collect stakeholder feedback on communication effectiveness
   - Document review findings and any plan adjustments
2. Conduct post-phase review after design-to-construction transition:
   - Assess design phase communication effectiveness
   - Identify lessons learned for construction phase
   - Document findings
3. Conduct closeout communications review (coordinate with PKG-07):
   - Assess overall project communication effectiveness
   - Document lessons learned for future projects

**Action (Recurring Governance Verification - X-007):**
1. Monthly: Verify meetings are occurring at planned frequency (compare meeting log to plan)
2. Monthly: Verify reports are being distributed per plan (compare distribution log to plan)
3. Quarterly: Verify escalation paths are functioning (review any escalations that occurred)
4. Document verification results in quarterly compliance review

**Verification:** Activation documented; cyclic reviews completed per schedule; governance verification ongoing.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on operational plan management principles.

**Enrichment Source:** Items A-005, A-009, C-005, D-004, E-003, X-007 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md (plan activation, transition, cyclic review, feedback collection, recurring verification).
