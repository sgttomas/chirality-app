## Attributes

### Plan Scope
- **Coverage**: Budget control framework, change management workflow, cost reporting protocols
- **Application phase**: Design-Build project delivery (design through commissioning)
- **Primary stakeholders**: Town of Penhold (Owner), Design-Builder Project Manager, Construction Manager, Estimator/Commercial Lead
- **Relationship to pricing**: Consistent with Appendix H pricing structure (Schedule A + Schedule B) [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-04-02; _CONTEXT.md]

### Control Mechanisms
- **Budget baseline**: TBD (derived from accepted Appendix H pricing)
- **Change order threshold**: TBD (to be established in plan)
- **Cost code structure**: TBD (minimum: General Requirements, Building, Sitework per Schedule B format; Additional Options 1-6 tracked separately; FF&E if included) [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-05-02] — **NOTE**: Canonical definition in Specification REQ-2 [Lensing: B-004 — uniform recording]
- **Reporting frequency**: TBD (plan to establish cadence; monthly minimum as baseline, with escalation triggers for peak construction periods) [Lensing: B-011 — principled steadfastness]
- **Contingency management**: TBD (approach per Specification REQ-7 as canonical) [Lensing: F-010 — dependable valuation discipline]
- **Measurement units and precision**: Cost tracking to nearest dollar; variance reporting as percentage with one decimal precision (e.g., 5.2%); forecast to complete as dollar amount [Lensing: B-001 — essential measurement]
- **Tracking system/tool**: TBD (options: spreadsheet-based cost tracking, dedicated software such as Procore/Sage, or ERP system integration — to be confirmed during contract negotiation based on Owner preferences and Design-Builder standard practices) [Lensing: F-004 — vital tracking competence]

### Change Management Elements
- **Change identification**: TBD (process for recognizing scope/cost changes)
- **Change authorization levels**: TBD (delegation of authority matrix)
- **Change documentation**: TBD (forms, logs, tracking system)
- **Change pricing methodology**: TBD (markup structure, time/materials rates)
- **Owner approval workflow**: TBD (submittal → review → authorization sequence)

### Cost Reporting Elements
- **Budget vs. actual tracking**: TBD (methodology and format)
- **Forecast to complete**: TBD (projection methodology)
- **Variance reporting**: TBD (thresholds for flags/escalation)
- **Commitment tracking**: TBD (purchase orders, subcontracts, pending changes)
- **Cash flow projection**: TBD (draw schedule alignment)

### Supervisory Roles for Budget Control Operations [Lensing: D-005 — active supervisory deployment]
- **Daily cost tracking**: Project Accountant / Cost Controller (TBD: role to be confirmed)
- **Weekly reviews**: Construction Manager + Commercial Lead
- **Monthly reporting**: Project Manager presents to Owner; Construction Manager prepares report
- **Change authorization**: Per delegation of authority matrix (see Specification REQ-4)

### Document Control Infrastructure [Lensing: E-004 — vital governance infrastructure]
- **Version control**: TBD (plan document to be version-controlled with revision history maintained)
- **Distribution tracking**: TBD (distribution list to be established; acknowledgement of receipt required for formal transmittals)
- **Supersession protocol**: Current version supersedes all prior versions; superseded versions archived

### Plan Quality Metrics [Lensing: A-011 — merit-based execution]
- **Completeness score**: TBD (percentage of required sections fully populated vs. TBD placeholders)
- **Alignment confidence**: TBD (degree of verified alignment with Appendix H pricing — to be assessed during internal review)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Plan quality metrics will be used for internal assessment; not formal submission criteria

## Conditions

### Operating Context
- **Project delivery method**: Design-Build (integrated design and construction responsibility) [Source: Decomposition §1]
- **Contract type**: Stipulated Price with Additional Options (1-6) [Source: Decomposition §5 Vocabulary Map; §8 DEL-05-01]
- **Owner expectations**: Transparency and control [Source: _CONTEXT.md Acceptance Criteria]
- **Addenda integration**: Addenda 01-03 impacts incorporated in baseline budget [Source: Decomposition §4]

### Design Context
- **Budget establishment point**: Proposal submission (Appendix H Schedule A + B totals) [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-05-01/02]
- **Scope clarifications impacting budget**:
  - Pickled Sand Storage building removed from scope [Source: Decomposition §4 Addendum 03]
  - Site servicing tie-ins allowance permitted [Source: Decomposition §4 Addendum 03]
  - FF&E may be additional item (not in base cost) [Source: Decomposition §5 Vocabulary Map]
  - **ASSUMPTION**: Budget baseline will reflect these exclusions/inclusions as priced in Appendix H

### Limiting Conditions
- **RFP compliance requirement**: Plan must demonstrate transparency and control consistent with pricing approach [Source: _CONTEXT.md]
- **Evaluation criterion**: Plan contributes to Project Delivery Plan score (10 points) [Source: Decomposition §15]
- **Constraint**: Dependencies coordinated externally (NOT_TRACKED mode) [Source: _DEPENDENCIES.md]

### Budget Authority Hierarchy [Lensing: E-001 — inviolable stewardship authority]
- **Ultimate authority**: Owner (Town of Penhold) — final approval for all changes above threshold; budget baseline acceptance
- **Design-Builder executive authority**: VP Construction or Project Director — approval of internal Design-Builder expenditures; changes below Owner threshold
- **Day-to-day stewardship**: Construction Manager — operational budget control; change identification; report preparation
- **NOTE**: Relationship between roles to be formalized in Specification REQ-4 authorization workflow

## Construction

### Plan Structure (anticipated) [Lensing: C-007, C-008 — exhaustive operational accounting; aligned with Procedure Step 3 as canonical]
- **Section 1**: Introduction (purpose, scope, relationship to Appendix H, key principles)
- **Section 2**: Budget Baseline and Cost Code Structure
- **Section 3**: Change Management Workflow (identification → pricing → approval → execution)
- **Section 4**: Cost Reporting Protocols (frequency, format, distribution)
- **Section 5**: Contingency Management Strategy
- **Section 6**: Integration with Project Controls (schedule, risk, communications, quality, safety)
- **Section 7**: Implementation and Governance (roles, responsibilities, tools, continuous improvement)
- **Appendices** (optional): Change Request Form Template, Change Order Log Template, Monthly Cost Report Template, Delegation of Authority Matrix
- **ASSUMPTION**: Standard Design-Build plan structure adapted to RFP requirements

### Workflow Components (anticipated)
- **Change identification trigger**: Owner request, design development, site conditions, unforeseen circumstances
- **Change request form**: Standard template (to be developed)
- **Change order log**: Chronological tracking of all changes (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Authorization matrix**: Owner signoff required for changes above threshold
- **Cost impact analysis**: Impact on budget, schedule, and project objectives
- **ASSUMPTION**: Industry-standard Design-Build change management practices apply

### Change Lifecycle Terminology (Canonical) [Lensing: F-007 — disciplined tracking consistency]
- **Change Identification Notice (CIN)**: Initial documentation that a potential change has been identified
- **Change Request (CR)**: Formal request for change, including proposed scope, cost, and schedule impact
- **Change Order (CO)**: Authorized change with signed approval from both Design-Builder and Owner
- **Change Order Threshold**: Dollar value above which Owner approval is required before proceeding
- **Change Authorization Matrix**: Delegation of authority defining approval levels by change value and type
- **NOTE**: All documents to use this canonical terminology consistently

### Reporting Components (anticipated)
- **Budget summary report**: Baseline, commitments, actual costs, forecast to complete, variance
- **Change order register**: All changes with status, value, cumulative impact
- **Cash flow projection**: Monthly draw forecast vs. actual
- **Contingency burn rate**: Tracking of contingency allocation and utilization
- **ASSUMPTION**: Reporting format to align with Owner's financial tracking needs
