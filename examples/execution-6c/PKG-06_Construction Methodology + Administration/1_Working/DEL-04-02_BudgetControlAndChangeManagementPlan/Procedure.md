## Steps

### Step 1: Review Context and Requirements
**Action**: Read and internalize the deliverable context and requirements.

**Tasks**:
1. Read **_CONTEXT.md** to understand deliverable identity, acceptance criteria, and scope traceability
2. Read **Decomposition §8 DEL-04-02** to understand output expectations and acceptance criteria
3. Read **Datasheet.md** to understand deliverable attributes, conditions, and related deliverables
4. Read **Specification.md** to understand the 12 requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-12) that the plan must address
5. Read **Guidance.md** to understand purpose, principles, considerations, trade-offs, and examples

**Output**: Clear understanding of what the plan must accomplish and how it will be evaluated.

**Verification**: Team can articulate the plan's purpose ("demonstrate transparency and control consistent with pricing approach") and the key requirements (budget baseline, cost codes, change workflow, reporting, contingency management, integration, consistency with Appendix H).

---

### Step 2: Confirm Coordination Inputs Available
**Action**: Verify that coordination inputs from related deliverables are available or understand their status.

**Tasks**:
1. **Check DEL-05-01/02 status**: Are Appendix H Schedule A and B substantially complete? If not, when will they be available?
2. **Check DEL-05-03 status**: Is the Pricing Narrative and Assumptions available to understand allowances, exclusions, and pricing basis?
3. **Check DEL-04-03 status**: Is the Communications and Reporting Plan in development? Can we coordinate on reporting frequency?
4. **Check DEL-08-01 status**: Is the schedule available for reference in the integration section?
5. **Check DEL-09-01 status**: Is the risk register available to inform contingency discussion?

**Output**: Status of coordination inputs documented; plan for how to handle missing inputs (e.g., placeholder text, TBD notes, assumptions).

**Verification**: Team knows which inputs are available now vs. will be available later; plan includes appropriate TBD or ASSUMPTION flags for missing inputs.

**Note**: Per _DEPENDENCIES.md, dependencies are coordinated externally. This step is about understanding status, not blocking progress. If inputs are not yet available, proceed with placeholders and revisit during proposal integration. [Source: _DEPENDENCIES.md — NOT_TRACKED mode]

**Critical Hold Points** [Lensing: C-005 — critical process control]:
While NOT_TRACKED mode means dependencies do not block progress, the following are critical hold points where proceeding without input significantly increases rework risk:
- **HOLD POINT 1**: Appendix H Schedule A/B availability — Budget baseline section (Step 4, Section 2) cannot be finalized without this input; placeholder acceptable but must be flagged for priority update
- **HOLD POINT 2**: Pricing Narrative (DEL-05-03) availability — Change pricing methodology (Step 4, Section 3) must align with pricing basis; inconsistency will fail cross-reference check (Step 5)
- **Action if hold point not cleared**: Document the gap explicitly in the plan with TBD flag; notify PM of coordination risk; schedule follow-up before finalization (Step 10)

---

### Step 3: Draft Plan Framework (Skeleton)
**Action**: Create the plan document structure with section headings and placeholders.

**Recommended Plan Structure** (adapt as needed):
```markdown
# Budget Control and Change Management Plan
## Penhold Public Services Building — Design-Build Proposal

### 1. Introduction
- Project overview
- Plan purpose and scope
- Relationship to proposal pricing (Appendix H)
- Key principles (transparency, control, integration)

### 2. Budget Baseline Establishment
- Budget baseline definition (Appendix H Schedule A totals)
- Addenda integration (scope changes reflected in baseline)
- Cost code structure (aligned with Schedule B)
- Budget reconciliation (baseline to approved contract)

### 3. Change Management Workflow
- Change identification triggers
- Change request process (form, submission, review)
- Change pricing methodology (consistent with proposal basis)
- Authorization and approval (delegation of authority matrix)
- Change order documentation and tracking
- Communication of approved changes

### 4. Cost Reporting Protocols
- Reporting frequency (monthly minimum)
- Report content and format (budget summary, change register, contingency, cash flow)
- Distribution list (Owner, Design-Builder PM, executive)
- Variance analysis and escalation thresholds

### 5. Contingency Management
- Contingency allocation (design, construction, Owner)
- Contingency authorization process
- Contingency utilization tracking and reporting
- Replenishment and reallocation process

### 6. Integration with Project Controls
- Schedule integration (cost-loaded schedule; milestone tracking)
- Risk management integration (contingency informed by risk register)
- Communications integration (reporting cadence aligned with Communications Plan)
- Quality management integration (budget for QA/QC activities)

### 7. Implementation and Governance
- Roles and responsibilities (PM, Construction Manager, Estimator, Owner Rep)
- Tools and systems (cost tracking software, document control)
- Continuous improvement (lessons learned, process refinement)

### Appendices (optional for proposal; may be developed during contract negotiation)
- Appendix A: Change Request Form Template
- Appendix B: Change Order Log Template
- Appendix C: Monthly Cost Report Template
- Appendix D: Delegation of Authority Matrix
```

**Output**: Plan document with section headings and brief placeholders ("This section will address...").

**Verification**: Structure is logical, comprehensive, and aligns with Specification REQ-1 through REQ-12.

---

### Step 4: Populate Plan Sections Using Specification and Guidance
**Action**: Develop narrative content for each plan section, drawing from Specification requirements and Guidance principles/considerations.

**Tasks for each section**:
1. **Review Specification REQs** relevant to the section (e.g., Section 2 Budget Baseline → REQ-1, REQ-2; Section 3 Change Management → REQ-3, REQ-4, REQ-5)
2. **Review Guidance principles and considerations** relevant to the section (e.g., Section 3 → Principle 2 "Early Change Identification", Principle 3 "Authority Clarity", Principle 4 "Consistent Pricing Methodology")
3. **Draft narrative** that:
   - States what the process/framework is (descriptive)
   - Explains why it's structured that way (rationale, referencing Guidance principles)
   - Identifies key decision points or flexibilities (e.g., "thresholds to be finalized during contract negotiation")
   - Cites sources where applicable (Appendix H, Decomposition, Addenda)
   - Flags TBD or ASSUMPTION where information is not yet available
   - **Specifies mandatory format requirements** [Lensing: A-003 — prescribed implementation]: Plan document shall include all sections listed in Step 3 skeleton; minimum plan length of 8-10 pages narrative (excluding appendices); submission format per proposal document standards (PDF, consistent formatting with other proposal sections)
4. **Include examples** where helpful (e.g., sample authority matrix from Guidance Example 2; sample report structure from Guidance Example 1)
5. **Emphasize transparency and control** to align with acceptance criteria [Source: _CONTEXT.md]

**Output**: Draft plan narrative with all major sections populated.

**Verification**: Each Specification REQ (REQ-1 through REQ-12) is addressed in at least one plan section; narrative demonstrates understanding of Design-Build budget control and change management.

---

### Step 5: Ensure Consistency with Appendix H Pricing (REQ-9)
**Action**: Cross-check the plan against Appendix H Schedule A, Schedule B, and Pricing Narrative (DEL-05-03) to ensure consistency.

**Consistency checks**:
1. **Budget baseline**: Plan states that budget baseline is the Appendix H Schedule A total (base + any selected Additional Options) → verify this matches Schedule A structure
2. **Cost codes**: Plan's cost code structure aligns with Schedule B breakdown (General Requirements, Building, Sitework, plus Additional Options 1-6 if applicable, plus FF&E if applicable) → verify alignment
3. **Change pricing methodology**: Plan states that change pricing will use markups/rates consistent with original proposal basis → verify this is consistent with DEL-05-03 pricing narrative
4. **Allowances and exclusions**: Plan acknowledges allowances (e.g., site servicing tie-ins) and exclusions (e.g., pickled sand storage building removed per Addendum 03) → verify consistency with DEL-05-03
5. **Optional items**: Plan addresses tracking of Additional Options 1-6 separately from base scope → verify alignment with Schedule A structure

**Output**: Plan narrative is consistent with Appendix H structure and assumptions; any inconsistencies identified and resolved (or flagged as conflicts).

**Verification**: No contradictions between plan and Appendix H; plan explicitly references Appendix H as budget baseline source.

**Consistency Evidence Requirements** [Lensing: B-002 — adequate evidence for coordination]:
To demonstrate adequate evidence of consistency with Appendix H:
- **Reconciliation table**: Create a table mapping plan cost code structure to Schedule B line items; document any gaps or additions
- **Cross-reference checklist**: Complete checklist confirming alignment on: baseline total, cost codes, allowances, exclusions, optional items, pricing methodology
- **Sign-off memo** (optional for proposal; recommended for contract): CM and Commercial Lead sign memo attesting to consistency review completion
- **Evidence artifact location**: Consistency evidence retained in deliverable working folder or proposal assembly records

**Note**: If DEL-05-01/02/03 are not yet complete, include placeholder text and note "To be confirmed upon completion of Appendix H (DEL-05-01/02/03)". [Source: Specification REQ-9; Guidance Consideration 3]

---

### Step 6: Ensure Integration with Other Deliverables (REQ-8)
**Action**: Verify that the plan describes integration with schedule, risk, communications, quality, and safety management.

**Integration checks**:
1. **Schedule integration** (DEL-08-01):
   - Plan states that budget will be tracked against project schedule (e.g., cost-loaded schedule showing planned vs. actual spend by milestone)
   - Plan references schedule as context for cash flow forecasting
   - If schedule is not yet available, include placeholder: "Integration with project schedule (DEL-08-01) will enable cost-loaded tracking and milestone-based budget reviews."
2. **Risk management integration** (DEL-09-01):
   - Plan states that contingency allocation is informed by the risk register (high-likelihood, high-impact risks drive contingency sizing)
   - Plan references risk register as a living document that may trigger contingency adjustments
   - If risk register is not yet available, include placeholder: "Contingency allocation informed by Risk Register (DEL-09-01); initial allocation based on industry benchmarks, to be refined as risks are quantified."
3. **Communications integration** (DEL-04-03):
   - Plan states reporting frequency and aligns with Communications Plan cadence (e.g., "Monthly cost reports will be issued in conjunction with monthly project status meetings as defined in the Communications and Reporting Plan (DEL-04-03)")
   - If Communications Plan is not yet available, propose a reporting frequency (e.g., monthly) and note coordination: "Reporting cadence to be finalized in coordination with Communications Plan (DEL-04-03)."
4. **Quality management integration** [Lensing: F-006]:
   - Plan addresses budget allocation for QA/QC activities (inspections, testing, third-party reviews)
   - Plan addresses cost impact of rework and quality deficiencies
   - Include placeholder if quality plan not yet available: "Budget for QA/QC activities to be aligned with Quality Management Plan; rework costs tracked as a variance category."
5. **Safety management integration** [Lensing: F-006]:
   - Plan addresses budget allocation for safety measures (equipment, training, site safety personnel)
   - Plan addresses cost impact of safety incidents (lost time, remediation, regulatory compliance)
   - Include placeholder: "Safety budget integrated with project safety plan; safety incident costs tracked separately for lessons learned."

**Output**: Plan includes explicit integration statements for all five management domains (schedule, risk, communications, quality, safety); references specific deliverables where applicable.

**Verification**: Specification REQ-8 is satisfied; plan demonstrates holistic project management approach across all five integration domains.

---

### Step 7: Review Against Evaluation Criteria and Acceptance Criteria
**Action**: Step back and assess whether the plan will score well on evaluation criteria and meet acceptance criteria.

**Evaluation check** (Decomposition §15: Project Delivery Plan = 10 points):
- **Credibility**: Does the plan read as realistic and implementable, not just boilerplate?
- **Thoroughness**: Does the plan address all aspects of budget control and change management (baseline, change workflow, reporting, contingency, integration)?
- **Clarity**: Is the plan easy to understand? Will evaluators be able to follow the change workflow and reporting approach?
- **Consistency**: Is the plan consistent with Appendix H pricing and other proposal sections (construction methodology, schedule, risk)?

**Acceptance criteria check** (_CONTEXT.md):
- **Transparency**: Does the plan clearly define all cost tracking, reporting, and change processes so the Owner has visibility?
- **Control**: Does the plan demonstrate mechanisms to prevent uncontrolled cost growth (authorization thresholds, contingency management, variance tracking)?
- **Consistency with pricing approach**: Is the plan aligned with Appendix H structure and assumptions?

**Output**: Plan is assessed against criteria; any gaps or weaknesses identified and addressed.

**Verification**: Team is confident that the plan will score well and meet acceptance criteria; no obvious evaluation risks.

---

### Step 8: Add TBD Flags and Assumptions Log
**Action**: Review the plan and ensure all unknowns, assumptions, and placeholders are clearly flagged.

**Tasks**:
1. **TBD flags**: Search for any statements that require additional information (e.g., "Owner approval threshold TBD pending contract negotiation"; "Reporting format TBD based on Owner preferences")
2. **ASSUMPTION labels**: Search for any inferred or assumed statements and ensure they are labeled (e.g., "ASSUMPTION: Monthly reporting is acceptable minimum frequency")
3. **Assumptions log**: Create a summary section or appendix listing all key assumptions (e.g., "Assumptions: (1) DBIA best practices applicable; (2) Owner will require approval for changes >$10,000; (3) Monthly reporting acceptable minimum; (4) RFP Section 7 contains detailed requirements (PDF not accessible)")
4. **Missing inputs log**: Document any reference materials that could not be accessed (e.g., "RFP Section 7 detailed requirements location TBD (PDF not accessible); Addendum 03 full text location TBD")

**Output**: Plan includes clear TBD flags, ASSUMPTION labels, and an assumptions log or notes section.

**Verification**: No unsupported statements presented as fact; all inferences and unknowns are transparent.

[Source: AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol — source-anchored with explicit assumptions; TBDs for unknowns]

---

### Step 9: Internal Review and Refinement
**Action**: Conduct internal team review of the draft plan before finalizing.

**Review roles**:
- **Construction Manager**: Verify that the change management workflow and construction phase cost control approach are realistic and implementable
- **Commercial Lead / Estimator**: Verify that the change pricing methodology and cost code structure are consistent with Appendix H and defensible
- **PM or Proposal Manager**: Verify that the plan aligns with overall proposal strategy, reads well, and will score well on evaluation criteria

**Review focus**:
- Clarity and readability (evaluators will read this under time pressure)
- Completeness (all Specification REQs addressed)
- Consistency (no contradictions with Appendix H or other deliverables)
- Credibility (does this sound like a real plan or just generic text?)
- Transparency and control emphasis (alignment with acceptance criteria)

**Role-Specific Verification Criteria** [Lensing: C-006 — competent oversight with specific checklists]:
- **Construction Manager verifies**:
  - [ ] Change identification triggers are realistic and comprehensive
  - [ ] Authorization matrix aligns with typical project operations
  - [ ] Reporting frequency is operationally feasible
  - [ ] Contingency management approach is practical
  - [ ] Integration with schedule/risk is achievable

- **Commercial Lead / Estimator verifies**:
  - [ ] Cost code structure matches Schedule B exactly
  - [ ] Budget baseline calculation is correct
  - [ ] Change pricing methodology is consistent with proposal basis
  - [ ] Markups and rates are defensible
  - [ ] Contingency percentages align with risk profile

- **PM / Proposal Manager verifies**:
  - [ ] Plan aligns with overall proposal strategy and messaging
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria from _CONTEXT.md are addressed
  - [ ] Evaluation criteria considerations are satisfied
  - [ ] No contradictions with other proposal sections
  - [ ] Professional presentation quality

**Evaluation Rating Scale** [Lensing: C-010 — consistent evaluative discipline]:
For Step 7 review, use the following rating scale for each evaluation dimension:
- **5 - Excellent**: Exceeds expectations; differentiates from competitors; no improvements needed
- **4 - Good**: Meets all requirements; minor enhancements possible but not essential
- **3 - Acceptable**: Meets minimum requirements; noticeable gaps or weaknesses
- **2 - Weak**: Falls short of requirements; significant revision needed
- **1 - Inadequate**: Fails to address requirement; major rework required

Minimum acceptable score: 3 on all dimensions; target score: 4+ on all dimensions

**Output**: Reviewed plan with revisions incorporated; team sign-off that plan is ready for finalization.

**Verification**: All reviewers agree that the plan meets requirements and will perform well in evaluation; all role-specific checklists completed.

---

### Step 10: Finalize and Deliver
**Action**: Finalize the plan document and deliver to the proposal assembly process.

**Tasks**:
1. **Formatting**: Ensure consistent formatting (headings, fonts, spacing) per proposal style guide
2. **Document metadata**: Add document title, project name, date, version, responsible parties (e.g., "Prepared by [Construction Manager Name], [Company], [Date]")
3. **Cross-references**: Verify that all references to other deliverables (DEL-05-01/02/03, DEL-04-03, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-01) are accurate
4. **Save and deliver**: Save final version to deliverable folder and notify proposal assembly lead that DEL-04-02 is ready for integration into proposal PDF

**Output**: Finalized Budget Control and Change Management Plan ready for inclusion in the proposal.

**Verification**: Document is complete, professionally formatted, and ready for proposal integration.

**Formal Attestation** [Lensing: F-002 — sufficient governance attestation]:
Before delivery, complete the following attestation:
- **Attestation statement**: "I attest that this Budget Control and Change Management Plan has been reviewed against all specified requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-12) and meets the acceptance criteria for submission."
- **Attestation by**: PM or Proposal Manager (name, date, signature if physical; email confirmation if electronic)
- **Record retention**: Attestation retained with proposal assembly records
- **NOTE**: For proposal phase, informal attestation (email confirmation) is acceptable; for contract execution, formal sign-off may be required

---

### Step 11: Update Status File
**Action**: Update _STATUS.md to reflect completion of initial document generation.

**Tasks**:
1. Read _STATUS.md and confirm current state is OPEN
2. If state is OPEN, update to INITIALIZED with history entry: `[2026-02-04] — State set to INITIALIZED (4_DOCUMENTS agent — enrichment pass completed)`
3. If state is not OPEN, do not modify _STATUS.md (no state regression); report to ORCHESTRATOR

**Output**: _STATUS.md updated to INITIALIZED (if applicable).

**Verification**: Status reflects deliverable state accurately.

[Source: AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol Step 7]

---

### Step 12: Plan Validation Walkthrough [Lensing: A-007 — executed protocol validation]
**Action**: Conduct a tabletop walkthrough of the budget control and change management processes described in the plan.

**Tasks**:
1. Assemble key team members (CM, Commercial Lead, PM) for 30-60 minute walkthrough session
2. Present a hypothetical change scenario (e.g., "Unforeseen geotechnical condition requiring additional foundation work; estimated cost $75,000")
3. Walk through the plan's change identification, pricing, authorization, and documentation process step by step
4. Identify any gaps, ambiguities, or impractical steps
5. Document findings and update plan if revisions needed

**Output**: Validated plan with walkthrough findings documented; confidence that plan is implementable.

**Verification**: Team can execute the plan processes in a realistic scenario without confusion or gaps.

**Note**: This step is optional for proposal phase (time permitting) but strongly recommended before contract execution.

---

### Step 13: Regulatory Review/Update Provision [Lensing: A-005 — regulatory reassessment]
**Action**: Establish a process for reassessing the plan if regulatory requirements change.

**Tasks**:
1. Document in the plan that regulatory review will be triggered by:
   - Issuance of new RFP addenda post-proposal submission
   - Changes to building codes or safety regulations during project
   - Municipal bylaw changes affecting budget reporting or procurement
2. Assign responsibility for monitoring regulatory changes (typically PM or Construction Manager)
3. Define update process: flag change → assess impact → revise affected plan sections → obtain sign-off

**Output**: Plan includes provision for regulatory reassessment; responsibility assigned.

**Verification**: Plan narrative includes regulatory update provision in Implementation and Governance section.

---

### Step 14: Enforcement and Compliance Provisions [Lensing: D-002 — enforceable compliance deployment]
**Action**: Ensure the plan addresses what happens if the budget control and change management processes are not followed during project execution.

**Tasks**:
1. Draft enforcement provisions for inclusion in plan's Governance section:
   - Non-compliance identification: How will deviations from the plan be identified? (e.g., audit of change order log, variance reporting review)
   - Consequences: What are the consequences of non-compliance? (e.g., escalation to PM, executive notification, contract remedies for material breaches)
   - Remediation: How will non-compliance be corrected? (e.g., retroactive documentation, process retraining, enhanced oversight)
2. Coordinate enforcement language with contract terms (during contract negotiation)

**Output**: Plan includes enforcement provisions addressing non-compliance identification, consequences, and remediation.

**Verification**: Governance section of plan includes enforcement language.

---

### Step 15: Post-Submission Re-Assessment Process [Lensing: X-008 — fundamental stewardship re-assessment]
**Action**: Define when and how the plan will be re-assessed after proposal submission.

**Tasks**:
1. Document re-assessment triggers:
   - Award of contract (plan becomes binding; must be reviewed for contract alignment)
   - Owner feedback during evaluation or negotiation (may require plan modifications)
   - Significant project scope change during negotiation
2. Define re-assessment process:
   - PM initiates review within 5 business days of trigger
   - CM and Commercial Lead review affected sections
   - Revisions drafted, reviewed, and approved before contract execution
3. Include re-assessment provision in plan narrative

**Output**: Plan includes post-submission re-assessment provision; process defined.

**Verification**: Plan narrative addresses post-submission update process.

### Process Audit Checkpoint [Lensing: A-009 — process audit during execution]
**Purpose**: During project execution (post-award), periodically review whether budget control and change management processes are being followed correctly.

**Audit frequency**: Quarterly during design phase; monthly during construction phase

**Audit scope**:
- Are change identification notices being documented for all potential changes?
- Is the authorization matrix being followed (appropriate approvals obtained)?
- Are cost reports being issued on schedule?
- Is the change order log current and accurate?
- Is contingency utilization being tracked and reported?

**Audit responsibility**: PM or designated project controls staff

**Audit output**: Brief audit memo documenting compliance status and any corrective actions required

**NOTE**: This checkpoint applies to project execution, not proposal preparation. Include in plan as a process audit commitment.

### Monitoring Effectiveness Review [Lensing: D-006 — systematic monitoring examination]
**Purpose**: Assess whether the monitoring and reporting system is achieving its intended purpose.

**Review questions**:
- Are reports being produced on time? (Track timeliness over 3-month periods)
- Are reports being read and acted upon? (Solicit feedback from Owner and executives)
- Are variances being identified early enough for corrective action? (Compare variance identification timing to cost impact)
- Is the reporting level of detail appropriate? (Not too granular, not too summary)

**Review frequency**: Quarterly during project execution

**Review responsibility**: PM in consultation with Owner Rep

**Output**: Monitoring effectiveness assessment; recommendations for reporting adjustments

### Lessons Learned (for future deliverables)
- **Coordination challenge**: Budget control plan depends heavily on Appendix H pricing being substantially complete; future deliverables should sequence accordingly or include robust placeholders
- **PDF accessibility**: RFP and Addenda PDFs were not accessible via text extraction tools; alternative access methods (OCR, manual transcription, or human review) needed for detailed requirements
- **Semantic lensing**: _SEMANTIC.md was a placeholder at time of document generation; future enrichment by CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK may surface additional warranted items
- **Integration complexity**: Budget control plan touches many other deliverables (pricing, schedule, risk, communications); strong coordination mechanisms needed in proposal assembly

## Notes

### Procedure Interpretation
This procedure describes the **production** of the Budget Control and Change Management Plan deliverable (the document creation process), not the **operation** of the budget control and change management system (which will be implemented during the actual Design-Build project if the proposal is successful).

Per AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol, Procedure.md is dual-use and can describe production and/or operation. In this case, production is the primary focus because the deliverable is a proposal document, not an operational system. [Source: AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS §STRUCTURE — Procedure Schema interpretation rule]

### Assumptions and Limitations
1. **NOT_TRACKED dependency mode**: This procedure assumes that coordination with related deliverables (DEL-05-01/02/03, DEL-04-03, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-01) is managed externally by humans (e.g., proposal manager, coordination meetings). The procedure identifies coordination points but does not enforce blocking dependencies. [Source: _DEPENDENCIES.md]

2. **PDF accessibility**: This procedure was developed without direct access to RFP Section 7 and Addendum 03 detailed text (PDF extraction tools not available). Detailed requirements are marked TBD; human review of PDFs is needed to validate and refine the plan. [Source: Datasheet References section; Specification Missing Inputs]

3. **Semantic lensing deferred**: _SEMANTIC.md was a placeholder at time of this procedure's creation. Future semantic enrichment by CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK may identify additional warranted items to incorporate into the plan. This procedure should be re-run or updated if significant semantic lensing results are available. [Source: Datasheet References section; AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol Pass 3]

4. **Proposal phase scope**: This procedure produces a **proposal-phase** plan (framework and commitment to processes). If the proposal is successful, the plan will be refined during contract negotiation and implementation planning. The procedure does not address post-award plan refinement.
