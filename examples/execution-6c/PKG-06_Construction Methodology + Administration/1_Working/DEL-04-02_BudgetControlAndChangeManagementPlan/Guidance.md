# Guidance: DEL-04-02 Budget Control and Change Management Plan

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists
The Budget Control and Change Management Plan serves as the framework for financial stewardship during the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build project. Its purpose is threefold:

1. **Owner confidence**: Demonstrates to the Town of Penhold that the Design-Builder has robust systems for budget control and transparent change management [Source: _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria — transparency and control]

2. **Evaluation scoring**: Contributes to the Project Delivery Plan evaluation criterion (10 points), which assesses the proponent's ability to deliver the project successfully [Source: Decomposition §15 evaluation crosswalk]

3. **Operational framework**: Provides the Design-Build team with a clear, agreed-upon process for managing costs and changes throughout design and construction, reducing disputes and enabling proactive management [ASSUMPTION: Standard Design-Build practice rationale]

**Value Proposition** [Lensing: A-010 — value orientation beyond compliance]:
Beyond compliance purposes, the Budget Control and Change Management Plan delivers tangible value to the project:
- **Early warning of cost overruns**: Variance tracking and escalation thresholds enable proactive intervention before minor variances become major overruns
- **Reduced disputes**: Clear change authorization workflow and pricing methodology minimize disagreements about change order scope, pricing, and authority
- **Predictable cash flow**: Regular reporting and forecasting enable both Owner and Design-Builder to plan cash requirements accurately
- **Accountability trail**: Documented change history provides audit trail for project closeout and lessons learned

### Downstream Use
- **Proposal evaluation**: Evaluators will assess the plan's credibility, thoroughness, and alignment with the pricing submission (Appendix H)
- **Contract negotiation**: If the proposal is successful, this plan becomes the basis for negotiating detailed cost control and change management procedures in the Design-Build Agreement
- **Project execution**: During design and construction, the plan guides day-to-day budget tracking, change request processing, and cost reporting to the Owner
- **Lessons learned**: At project closeout, the plan's effectiveness will be reviewed to inform future Design-Build projects [ASSUMPTION: Standard project management practice]

**Plan Effectiveness Evaluation Criteria** [Lensing: D-007 — directed appraisal framework]:
Post-implementation, the plan's effectiveness should be evaluated against:
- Did the plan prevent budget overruns? (Compare final cost to original baseline)
- Were change orders processed efficiently? (Measure average change processing time; number of disputed changes)
- Was the Owner satisfied with reporting? (Solicit Owner feedback at project closeout)
- Were contingency funds managed appropriately? (Compare contingency consumption to risk register predictions)
- **NOTE**: These criteria to be formalized during contract negotiation as part of continuous improvement process

## Principles

### Underlying Engineering Rationale

#### Principle 1: Transparency Builds Trust
**Rationale**: In Design-Build delivery, the Design-Builder controls both design and pricing, which can create Owner concern about cost visibility. Proactive, transparent reporting—showing baseline, commitments, actuals, and forecast—demonstrates that the Design-Builder is managing costs as a steward of Owner funds, not just maximizing profit. [Source: _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria emphasizing transparency]

**Application**: The plan must define clear reporting formats, frequencies, and distribution lists that give the Owner real-time visibility into project finances.

---

#### Principle 2: Early Change Identification Minimizes Impact
**Rationale**: Changes identified early in the design process are far less costly and disruptive than changes during construction. A robust change identification process—triggered by design evolution, Owner requests, or unforeseen site conditions—enables proactive management rather than reactive crisis response. [ASSUMPTION: Standard construction management principle]

**Application**: The plan must define clear triggers for change identification (e.g., any deviation from baseline scope, Owner request, value engineering proposal, unforeseen site condition) and a low-friction process for raising potential changes for discussion.

---

#### Principle 3: Authority Clarity Prevents Disputes
**Rationale**: Ambiguity about who can authorize changes—and at what dollar threshold—leads to disputes, delays, and budget overruns. A clear delegation of authority matrix (Design-Builder internal authorities; Owner approval thresholds) ensures that changes are properly authorized before work proceeds. [ASSUMPTION: Standard Design-Build contract principle]

**Application**: The plan must establish a matrix showing which changes can be approved by the Design-Builder PM, which require Design-Builder executive approval, and which require Owner authorization (typically above a defined dollar threshold or any change affecting substantial completion date).

---

#### Principle 4: Consistent Pricing Methodology Reduces Friction
**Rationale**: If every change is priced using a different methodology (e.g., arbitrary markups, inconsistent unit rates), the Owner will lose confidence and every change becomes a negotiation. A consistent, transparent pricing methodology—aligned with the original proposal pricing basis—streamlines change pricing and approval. [Source: _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria — consistent with pricing approach]

**Application**: The plan must define how changes will be priced (e.g., time and materials with agreed rates; unit pricing where applicable; markup structure consistent with Schedule B breakdown).

---

#### Principle 5: Contingency Is Not Profit
**Rationale**: Contingency exists to manage risk and uncertainty, not to pad the Design-Builder's profit margin. Proper contingency management—with clear allocation (design contingency vs. construction contingency vs. Owner contingency), authorization, and tracking—ensures contingency is used appropriately and the Owner has visibility into its utilization. [ASSUMPTION: Standard project controls principle]

**Application**: The plan must define contingency allocation, how contingency is accessed (e.g., PM approval up to $X; Owner approval above $X), and how contingency utilization is reported (e.g., "design contingency 40% consumed; construction contingency 10% consumed").

**Project-Specific Contingency Benchmarks** [Lensing: B-009 — fundamental prudence with context-specific guidance]:
For a municipal facility in the ~$10-20M range delivered via Design-Build, typical contingency benchmarks are:
- **Design contingency**: 3-5% of design fees (to address design iterations and unforeseen complexity)
- **Construction contingency**: 5-10% of construction costs (higher for projects with geotechnical or site condition uncertainty, as with this project)
- **Owner contingency**: 5-10% held by Owner for Owner-directed changes (outside Design-Builder's control)
- **ASSUMPTION**: These benchmarks are industry norms; actual allocations to be informed by Risk Register (DEL-09-01) and negotiated during contract award
- **NOTE**: Site constraints (geotechnical conditions, wetlands, flood fringe) for this project suggest contingency toward higher end of ranges

---

#### Principle 6: Integration Enables Holistic Management
**Rationale**: Budget control does not exist in isolation. A change that saves cost may delay the schedule; a risk mitigation action may consume contingency. Integration with schedule management, risk management, and communications ensures that cost decisions consider project-wide impacts. [Source: Decomposition §8 — related deliverables DEL-04-03, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-01]

**Application**: The plan must describe how budget control integrates with:
- **Schedule**: Cost-loaded schedule or milestone-based cost tracking
- **Risk**: Contingency allocation informed by risk register likelihood/impact
- **Communications**: Reporting cadence aligned with Communications Plan (DEL-04-03)
- **Quality**: Budget allocation for QA/QC activities; cost tracking for rework [Lensing: F-006]
- **Safety**: Budget allocation for safety measures; cost tracking for safety incidents [Lensing: F-006]

**Stewardship Accountability Model** [Lensing: A-006 — procedural stewardship obligation]:
Beyond the Construction Manager's day-to-day responsibility, the stewardship obligation for the budget control process includes:
- **Primary steward**: Construction Manager — ensures process is followed; prepares reports; identifies deviations
- **Supervisory steward**: Project Manager — reviews compliance; approves reports; escalates issues
- **Executive steward**: VP Construction or Project Director — accountable for overall budget performance; authorizes significant expenditures
- **Escalation path**: CM → PM → VP/Director → Owner (for issues requiring Owner decision)
- **NOTE**: This accountability model should be formalized in the plan's Roles and Responsibilities section

## Considerations

### Factors to Weigh During Plan Development

#### Consideration 1: Owner Risk Tolerance
**Factor**: Some Owners prefer tight control (low change authorization threshold; frequent reporting) while others prefer autonomy (higher threshold; less frequent reporting). The plan must balance demonstrating control (for evaluation scoring) with avoiding excessive administrative burden.

**Guidance**: For a municipal Owner on a public procurement, err toward tighter control and more frequent reporting to demonstrate stewardship of public funds. Propose monthly cost reporting as a minimum, with the option to adjust frequency during contract negotiation. [ASSUMPTION: Municipal project best practice]

---

#### Consideration 2: Design Phase vs. Construction Phase Control
**Factor**: Budget control during design is fundamentally different from construction. During design, "cost" is mostly design labor and consultant fees, while the building cost is a forecast. During construction, the building cost becomes actual commitments and expenditures.

**Guidance**: The plan should acknowledge this duality and define distinct approaches:
- **Design phase**: Track design budget (internal labor, consultants) separately; track building cost as "estimate at completion" updated at key milestones (e.g., 30% DD, 60% DD, 90% CD)
- **Construction phase**: Track actual commitments (purchase orders, subcontracts) and expenditures; compare to baseline budget (accepted Schedule B)

---

#### Consideration 3: Addenda Impact on Baseline
**Factor**: Addendum 03 removed the pickled sand storage building and clarified allowances for site servicing tie-ins. The budget baseline must reflect these changes to avoid confusion. [Source: Decomposition §4 Addendum 03]

**Guidance**: The plan must explicitly state that the budget baseline is the **addenda-integrated Appendix H totals**, not the pre-addenda RFP scope. Any references to "original scope" should clarify whether they mean pre-addenda or post-addenda.

---

#### Consideration 4: Optional Items Tracking
**Factor**: The proposal includes six Additional Options (built-in wash bay, yard lighting, access control, security/cameras, exterior signage, appliances). If the Owner selects some but not all options, the budget must track base scope and optional scope separately. [Source: Decomposition §5 Vocabulary Map]

**Guidance**: The cost code structure should include separate codes for each Additional Option, enabling clear tracking of which options are authorized and their costs. Change orders should indicate whether they affect base scope or optional scope.

---

#### Consideration 5: FF&E Treatment
**Factor**: Addendum 03 allows FF&E (furniture, fixtures, equipment) to be included as an additional item, not in base cost. If FF&E is included, its budget must be tracked separately. [Source: Decomposition §5 Vocabulary Map; Open Issue OI-004]

**Guidance**: If FF&E is included in the proposal, establish a separate cost code for FF&E and clarify in the plan whether FF&E changes follow the same authorization process as base building changes or have a different process (e.g., Owner direct authorization).

---

#### Consideration 6: Site Condition Risks
**Factor**: The site has known constraints (geotechnical conditions, wetlands, flood fringe). If unforeseen site conditions arise, the change management process must handle them efficiently to avoid delays. [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-09-02 — site due diligence summary]

**Guidance**: The plan should identify site conditions as a specific change trigger and define an expedited review process for site condition changes (e.g., field review with Owner rep; immediate verbal authorization followed by formal change order).

## Trade-offs

### Competing Concerns in Budget Control and Change Management

#### Trade-off 1: Control Rigor vs. Administrative Burden
**Tension**: Tight budget control (low thresholds, frequent reporting, multiple approval layers) provides Owner confidence but increases administrative overhead and can slow decision-making.

**Considerations**:
- **Pro control**: Municipal project with public accountability; evaluation criterion emphasizes transparency and control [Source: _CONTEXT.md]
- **Pro efficiency**: Design-Build delivery model emphasizes speed and integrated decision-making

**Recommendation**: Propose monthly cost reporting and a change authorization threshold at a moderate level (e.g., Owner approval required for individual changes >$10,000 or cumulative changes >$50,000). Emphasize that thresholds can be adjusted during contract negotiation based on Owner preference. [ASSUMPTION: Reasonable threshold for a municipal facility project]

**Threshold Justification** [Lensing: B-010 — balanced judgment with project-specific reasoning]:
The proposed thresholds (~$10,000 individual; ~$50,000 cumulative) are calibrated to this project's characteristics:
- **Project value context**: For a ~$15M project (ASSUMPTION: mid-range of $10-20M), $10,000 represents ~0.07% of project value — small enough to enable operational flexibility, large enough to warrant Owner visibility
- **Municipal accountability**: Public funds require reasonable oversight; thresholds below typical municipal purchasing approval limits
- **Cumulative limit rationale**: $50,000 cumulative (~0.33% of project value) prevents "death by a thousand cuts" scenario where many small changes accumulate to significant budget impact without Owner awareness
- **ASSUMPTION**: These thresholds are starting points; Owner may request tighter control based on municipal policies or past project experience

---

#### Trade-off 2: Fixed Contingency vs. Risk-Informed Allocation
**Tension**: A fixed contingency percentage (e.g., 5% design, 5% construction) is simple but may not reflect actual project risks. A risk-informed allocation (contingency sized to risk register) is more sophisticated but harder to explain and defend.

**Considerations**:
- **Pro fixed**: Simple, traditional, easy to compare across proposals
- **Pro risk-informed**: Demonstrates maturity and aligns contingency with actual risks (DEL-09-01 Risk Register)

**Recommendation**: Use a hybrid approach—propose a fixed percentage contingency in the plan, but note that the allocation is informed by the risk register and will be refined as risks are retired or new risks emerge. Reference DEL-09-01 to show integration. [Source: Specification REQ-8 — integration with risk management]

---

#### Trade-off 3: Prescriptive Workflow vs. Flexible Process
**Tension**: A prescriptive change workflow (e.g., "Step 1: PM submits change request; Step 2: Owner reviews within 5 days; Step 3: Design-Builder prices within 10 days...") is clear but may not fit all change types. A flexible process ("changes are managed collaboratively") is adaptable but vague.

**Considerations**:
- **Pro prescriptive**: Proposal evaluators can assess the process credibility; reduces ambiguity
- **Pro flexible**: Real projects require adaptation to circumstances (urgent site condition changes, minor administrative changes, etc.)

**Recommendation**: Define a prescriptive workflow as the **default** but include exceptions for expedited changes (e.g., site condition changes with field authorization) and minor changes (e.g., changes <$1,000 processed as administrative adjustments without formal Owner approval, reported in monthly summary). This shows both rigor and pragmatism.

**Formalized Exception Workflows** [Lensing: F-005 — proportionate oversight with equal rigor for exceptions]:
The following exception workflows shall be defined with the same procedural rigor as the default workflow:

1. **Expedited Change Workflow** (site conditions, safety, or time-critical):
   - Trigger: Condition requiring immediate action to avoid delay, safety risk, or cost escalation
   - Authorization: Field authorization by PM + Owner Rep (verbal, followed by written confirmation within 24 hours)
   - Documentation: Change Identification Notice within 24 hours; formal Change Order within 5 business days
   - Reporting: Flagged in next monthly report with "Expedited" designation

2. **Minor Change Workflow** (<$1,000):
   - Trigger: Change below administrative threshold
   - Authorization: PM approval only (no Owner approval required)
   - Documentation: Entry in Change Order Log with "Administrative" designation
   - Reporting: Summarized in monthly report as "Administrative Adjustments"; individual items not detailed

3. **Emergency Change Workflow** (life safety or imminent property damage):
   - Trigger: Immediate threat to life safety or imminent property damage
   - Authorization: Any authorized personnel may take immediate action; PM notified within 2 hours
   - Documentation: Incident report within 24 hours; Change Order to follow standard expedited process
   - Reporting: Flagged in monthly report with "Emergency" designation; reviewed for lessons learned

---

#### Trade-off 4: Owner Transparency vs. Competitive Sensitivity
**Tension**: Full transparency (e.g., showing Design-Builder's actual subcontractor costs, markups, and profit margins) builds trust but may expose competitive information the Design-Builder prefers to protect.

**Considerations**:
- **Pro transparency**: Builds Owner confidence; reduces disputes
- **Pro confidentiality**: Protects Design-Builder's competitive position and subcontractor relationships

**Recommendation**: Propose transparency at the **cost code level** (e.g., "General Requirements actual: $X; Building actual: $Y; Sitework actual: $Z") without disclosing individual subcontractor bid details or markup percentages. This balances transparency with commercial reasonableness. Note that change order pricing will include markups consistent with the original proposal basis. [Source: Specification REQ-5 — consistent pricing methodology]

**Rationale for Cost Code Level Disclosure** [Lensing: B-007 — comprehensive disclosure justification]:
Cost code level represents the appropriate disclosure boundary because:
- It provides sufficient granularity for Owner to understand where costs are accumulating (General Requirements vs. Building vs. Sitework vs. Options)
- It protects Design-Builder's competitive pricing information (specific subcontractor costs, negotiated discounts, profit margins)
- It aligns with the Schedule B breakdown that Owner has already accepted as the pricing structure
- Line-item detail would be excessive (hundreds of items) and would risk competitive harm without proportional Owner benefit
- Aggregate-only reporting would be insufficient for Owner to understand cost drivers and exercise informed oversight

## Examples

### Example 1: Monthly Cost Report Structure (Illustrative)
**Context**: What a typical monthly cost report might include to demonstrate transparency and control.

**Sample Report Sections**:
1. **Executive Summary**: Budget status at a glance (green/yellow/red indicators for budget health)
2. **Budget Summary Table**:
   - Original baseline (Appendix H Schedule A total)
   - Approved change orders to date (cumulative)
   - Revised budget (baseline + approved changes)
   - Committed costs (POs, subcontracts issued)
   - Actual costs to date (invoices paid)
   - Forecast to complete (committed + anticipated remaining costs)
   - Variance (revised budget vs. forecast to complete)
3. **Change Order Register**:
   - Change order number, description, status (pending/approved/rejected), value, cumulative impact
4. **Contingency Utilization**:
   - Design contingency: allocated / utilized / remaining
   - Construction contingency: allocated / utilized / remaining
5. **Cash Flow Projection**: Monthly draw forecast vs. actual (for next 6 months)
6. **Variance Analysis**: Explanation of any significant variances (budget vs. forecast)

**TBD**: Actual report format to be refined during Working Items session and contract negotiation.

**Note on Example Status** [Lensing: F-009 — sufficient evaluative demonstration]:
This example is labeled "Illustrative" but provides a representative structure that evaluators can assess for competence. For the proposal submission, the example should be strengthened to show:
- Actual or realistic sample numbers (even if placeholders, should show proper magnitude for project scale)
- Specific variance threshold indicators (Green/Yellow/Red as defined in Specification REQ-6)
- Sample narrative explaining a hypothetical variance to demonstrate analytical capability

### Example 2: Change Authorization Matrix (Illustrative)
**Context**: How authority for change approvals might be delegated.

| Change Value | Change Type | Design-Builder Authority | Owner Approval Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| <$1,000 | Administrative adjustment | Project Manager | No (reported in monthly summary) |
| $1,000–$10,000 | Minor change | Project Manager | Yes (routine approval) |
| $10,000–$50,000 | Moderate change | Senior PM / Construction Manager | Yes (detailed review) |
| >$50,000 or affects substantial completion | Major change | Executive (VP or above) | Yes (formal approval with Council briefing if >$100k) |
| Any change affecting safety or code compliance | Safety/code change | Immediate field authorization (PM + Owner Rep) | Yes (formal documentation to follow) |

**TBD**: Actual thresholds to be negotiated based on Owner risk tolerance and project value.

---

### Example 3: Change Identification Triggers (Illustrative)
**Context**: What events should trigger a change identification and documentation process.

**Triggers**:
1. **Owner request**: Owner requests additional scope, upgrade, or modification
2. **Design development**: Design evolution beyond baseline scope (e.g., structural system change, building footprint expansion)
3. **Value engineering**: Design-Builder proposes a value engineering change (cost savings or performance improvement)
4. **Unforeseen site conditions**: Geotechnical, environmental, or utility conditions differing from reference reports
5. **Code or regulatory change**: Authority having jurisdiction imposes new requirement after proposal submission
6. **Third-party impacts**: Utility provider, adjacent landowner, or other third party imposes constraint or requirement
7. **Force majeure**: Weather, labor disruption, or other event beyond Design-Builder control affecting cost or schedule

**Process**: When a trigger occurs, PM documents the trigger, assesses potential cost/schedule impact, and submits a change identification notice to Owner within [X days]. Owner and Design-Builder jointly determine whether to proceed with formal change pricing or manage within existing scope/contingency.

**TBD**: Trigger list and response timelines to be refined during contract negotiation.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

**Status**: No conflicts identified during initial document generation (Pass 1). This section will be populated during Pass 2 (cross-reference consistency check) if conflicts arise that cannot be resolved from available information.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority (PROPOSAL) | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — | — | — | TBD |

## Notes

### General Guidance for Working Items Session
- **This is a draft scaffold**: The plan narrative will be developed during the Working Items session with the responsible Construction Manager and Commercial Lead.
- **Focus on credibility**: Evaluators will assess whether the plan is realistic, thorough, and consistent with the pricing submission (Appendix H).
- **Avoid excessive detail**: The proposal-phase plan should establish the framework; implementation details (e.g., specific forms, software tools) can be refined during contract negotiation.
- **Emphasize integration**: Highlight how budget control connects to schedule, risk, and communications to show holistic project management maturity.

### Key Integration Points (from Decomposition §8)
- **DEL-05-01/02/03** (Appendix H and pricing narrative): Budget baseline and pricing assumptions — **must be completed before finalizing this plan**
- **DEL-04-03** (Communications and Reporting Plan): Reporting cadence and distribution — **coordinate to ensure consistent reporting frequency**
- **DEL-08-01** (Detailed Project Schedule): Schedule context for cost-loaded tracking — **reference for integration**
- **DEL-09-01** (Risk Register and Mitigation Plan): Informs contingency allocation — **reference for integration**
- **DEL-04-01** (Construction Methodology): Construction approach context — **reference for consistency**

### Assumptions Requiring Validation
1. Monthly cost reporting is acceptable minimum frequency (may need to be more frequent during construction peak)
2. DBIA best practices are appropriate reference for Design-Build budget control and change management
3. Owner will want approval authority for changes above a moderate threshold (~$10,000 individual; ~$50,000 cumulative)
4. RFP Section 7 contains detailed expectations for budget control and change management (PDF not accessible; detailed requirements TBD)
5. Contingency allocation will be negotiated during contract award (proposal can state percentages but flexibility is expected)

**Assumption Validation Framework** [Lensing: X-009 — total stewardship re-examination]:
Each assumption above shall be validated according to the following framework:
- **When**: During contract negotiation (assumptions 1, 3, 5); during RFP clarification or human review (assumption 4); at project initiation (assumption 2)
- **How**: Direct confirmation with Owner for operational assumptions; document review for regulatory assumptions
- **By whom**: PM responsible for Owner-related assumptions; Commercial Lead for industry practice assumptions
- **If invalidated**: Update affected documents (Specification, Guidance, Procedure) with corrected information; reassess requirements impacted by the assumption

### Plan Review and Update Guidance [Lensing: D-003 — recursive stewardship scrutiny]
This plan is a living document and shall be reviewed and updated during the project lifecycle:
- **Contract negotiation**: Review all TBD items and ASSUMPTIONS; incorporate negotiated terms
- **Project milestones**: Review at 30% DD, 60% DD, 90% CD, and Construction Commencement; update if project conditions have changed
- **After significant changes**: Any change >$100,000 or affecting substantial completion date triggers plan review
- **Annually** (for multi-year projects): Annual review to ensure plan remains current and effective
- **Trigger for immediate review**: Change in key personnel, Owner representative, or project delivery approach

### Competitive Differentiation Guidance [Lensing: E-007 — exhaustive merit comprehension]
To elevate the plan from merely adequate to compelling for evaluators:
- **Demonstrate experience**: Reference specific past projects where similar budget control and change management approaches were successfully implemented
- **Show integration**: Explicitly connect budget control to schedule, risk, quality, and safety — demonstrate holistic project management capability
- **Provide specificity**: Use concrete numbers, percentages, and timelines rather than vague commitments (e.g., "reports within 10 business days" not "timely reports")
- **Address known risks**: Acknowledge site-specific challenges (geotechnical, wetlands) and describe how budget control will address cost uncertainty from these risks
- **Offer value-adds**: Consider proposing enhanced reporting (e.g., online dashboard access for Owner) or proactive value engineering reviews
