4. **Risk management processes** (covered by DEL-09-01) [Source: Decomposition §8]
5. **Contract administration** beyond budget and change management (general contract management)

### Boundary Conditions
- **Baseline establishment**: Budget baseline is the accepted proposal pricing (Appendix H) [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-04-02 acceptance criteria]
- **Authority limits**: Plan must align with Design-Build contract authority delegation (Owner approval required above defined thresholds)
- **Transparency requirement**: Plan must demonstrate transparency and control to satisfy RFP evaluation criteria [Source: _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria]
- **ASSUMPTION**: Plan addresses proposal phase commitments; implementation details will be refined during contract negotiation

## Requirements

### REQ-1: Budget Baseline Establishment
**Statement**: The plan shall establish a clear budget baseline derived from the accepted proposal pricing (Appendix H Schedule A totals).

**Rationale**: Provides the reference point for all budget control and variance tracking. [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-05-01]

**Verification**: Budget baseline documented in plan and reconcilable to Appendix H totals.

**Status**: TBD — pending Appendix H completion

---

### REQ-2: Cost Code Structure
**Statement**: The plan shall define a cost code structure consistent with Appendix H Schedule B breakdown (minimum: General Requirements, Building, Sitework; Additional Options 1-6 tracked separately).

**Rationale**: Enables consistent cost tracking from proposal through construction. [Source: Decomposition §8 DEL-05-02]

**Verification**: Cost code structure documented and mappable to Schedule B line items.

**Status**: TBD — pending Schedule B finalization

---

### REQ-3: Change Identification Process
**Statement**: The plan shall define the process for identifying, documenting, and escalating potential changes in scope, cost, or schedule.

**Rationale**: Early identification prevents scope creep and budget overruns. [ASSUMPTION: Standard Design-Build practice]

**Verification**: Change identification triggers and documentation requirements defined in plan.

**Status**: TBD

---

### REQ-4: Change Authorization Workflow
**Statement**: The plan shall establish a clear change authorization workflow including:
- Delegation of authority matrix (Design-Builder internal and Owner approval thresholds)
- Change request form template
- Review and approval sequence
- Documentation and communication requirements
- Distinction between base scope changes and Additional Option activation [Lensing: C-004 — harmonized governance for contract type]
- Detection mechanism for unauthorized changes (e.g., work executed without proper authorization shall be flagged during cost reconciliation) [Lensing: X-004 — capable enforcement validation]

**Rationale**: Ensures all changes are properly authorized and documented before execution. [ASSUMPTION: RFP Section 7 requirements]

**Verification**: Workflow diagram, authority matrix, and templates included in plan; distinction between base scope and option changes documented.

**Status**: TBD — pending RFP Section 7 detailed review **location TBD**

---

### REQ-5: Change Pricing Methodology
**Statement**: The plan shall define the methodology for pricing changes, including:
- Markup structure (overhead and profit)
- Time and materials rates (if applicable)
- Unit pricing approach (if applicable)
- Consistency with proposal pricing basis

**Rationale**: Transparent pricing methodology builds Owner confidence and reduces disputes. [Source: _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria — transparency]

**Verification**: Pricing methodology documented in plan.

**Status**: TBD

---

### REQ-6: Cost Reporting Frequency and Format
**Statement**: The plan shall establish cost reporting frequency (minimum monthly) and report format including:
- Budget baseline
- Committed costs (purchase orders, subcontracts)
- Actual costs to date
- Forecast to complete
- Variance analysis (budget vs. forecast) with defined variance threshold bands (e.g., Green: within 2%; Yellow: 2-5% variance; Red: >5% variance) [Lensing: A-008 — performance adjudication thresholds]
- Change order summary (pending and approved)
- Timeliness requirement: Reports issued within 10 business days of month-end [Lensing: B-006 — satisfactory reporting]
- Distribution timeline: Concurrent distribution to Owner, PM, and executive within 2 business days of report finalization [Lensing: B-006]
- Variance breach threshold: Variance >5% constitutes actionable budget breach requiring corrective action plan [Lensing: X-005 — binding operational determination]

**Monitoring governance framework** [Lensing: D-004 — process-driven monitoring governance]:
- Report review responsibility: Owner Rep and Design-Builder PM jointly review monthly report
- Decision triggers: Variance exceeding 5% triggers escalation meeting within 5 business days
- Escalation protocol: Yellow/Red status items escalated to executive level; corrective action required within 15 business days

**Rationale**: Regular, transparent reporting demonstrates control and enables proactive management. [Source: _CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria — transparency and control]

**Verification**: Reporting frequency, format, timeliness requirements, and sample report included in plan; variance thresholds defined.

**Status**: TBD

---

### REQ-7: Contingency Management Strategy
**Statement**: The plan shall define the contingency management strategy including:
- Contingency allocation (design, construction, owner)
- Authorization process for contingency use
- Tracking and reporting of contingency utilization
- Trigger conditions for contingency replenishment discussion

**Rationale**: Proper contingency management prevents uncontrolled budget erosion. [ASSUMPTION: Standard practice]

**Verification**: Contingency strategy documented in plan.

**Status**: TBD

---

### REQ-8: Integration with Schedule and Risk Management
**Statement**: The plan shall describe integration mechanisms linking budget control to:
- Project schedule (cost-loaded schedule or milestone-based tracking)
- Risk management (contingency aligned with risk register)
- Communications plan (reporting cadence and distribution)
- Quality management (budget allocation for QA/QC activities; cost impact of rework) [Lensing: F-006 — total oversight comprehension]
- Safety management (budget allocation for safety measures; cost impact of safety incidents) [Lensing: F-006]

**Rationale**: Budget control cannot operate in isolation; integration ensures holistic project control. [Source: Decomposition §8 — related deliverables DEL-04-03, DEL-09-01]

**Verification**: Integration points documented in plan for all five management domains.

**Status**: TBD

---

### REQ-9: Consistency with Pricing Approach
**Statement**: The plan shall be consistent with the pricing approach documented in DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions), including treatment of:
- Allowances (e.g., site servicing tie-ins)
- Exclusions (e.g., pickled sand storage building removed)
- Optional items (Additional Options 1-6)
- FF&E handling (if included as additional item)

**Rationale**: Budget control must align with proposal pricing assumptions to avoid confusion and disputes. [Source: Decomposition §4 Addendum 03; §8 DEL-05-03]

**Verification**: Plan references and aligns with pricing assumptions.

**Status**: TBD — pending DEL-05-03 completion

---

### REQ-10: Addenda Integration
**Statement**: The plan shall reflect scope and pricing impacts from Addenda 01-03, including:
- Removal of pickled sand storage building from scope

**Verification**: Addenda impacts acknowledged in plan.

**Status**: TBD — pending Addenda detailed review **location TBD**

---

### REQ-11: Requirement Criticality Classification [Lensing: C-001, F-001 — binding accountability threshold; inviolable compliance]
**Statement**: Requirements shall be classified by criticality tier:
- **Tier 1 (Inviolable)**: REQ-1 (budget baseline), REQ-2 (cost codes), REQ-9 (consistency with Appendix H), REQ-10 (addenda integration) — sourced to RFP/contract requirements; non-negotiable
- **Tier 2 (Required)**: REQ-3 (change identification), REQ-6 (reporting), REQ-8 (integration) — best practice requirements; refinable during contract negotiation
- **Tier 3 (Recommended)**: REQ-4 (authorization workflow), REQ-5 (pricing methodology), REQ-7 (contingency) — sourced to ASSUMPTION/best practice; thresholds and details negotiable

**Rationale**: Distinguishes mandatory compliance from elective best practice for contract negotiation flexibility.

**Verification**: Each requirement labeled with criticality tier; tier classification reviewed during contract negotiation.

**Status**: TBD — criticality assignments are ASSUMPTION pending RFP Section 7 detailed review

---

### REQ-12: Requirement Traceability [Lensing: F-003 — integral compliance transparency]
**Statement**: The plan shall include a compliance traceability matrix mapping each requirement to its authorizing source (RFP clause, Addendum, DBIA standard, or ASSUMPTION).

**Rationale**: Enables transparent verification of compliance and supports contract negotiation by identifying requirements with clear authority vs. assumptions.

**Verification Criteria Enhancement** [Lensing: A-004 — compliance determination with objective criteria]:
All acceptance criteria above include quantitative or objective pass/fail elements where feasible to enable consistent verification.

**Independent Verification Methods** [Lensing: C-003 — total conformance coverage]:
In addition to internal document review, the following independent verification methods shall be employed:
- Owner confirmation of acceptance criteria alignment (during contract negotiation or pre-submission review if available)
- Cross-check against related deliverables by separate team member (not the author)

**Certification Process and Timing** [Lensing: X-006 — sufficient performance certification]:
- **Certification trigger**: All REQs status changed from TBD to Verified or Waived
- **Certification authority**: PM or Proposal Manager signs off on verification table
- **Timing**: Certification required before final proposal submission; incomplete certifications flagged to executive

### Acceptance Criteria (from _CONTEXT.md)
The completed Budget Control and Change Management Plan shall:
1. **Demonstrate transparency**: All cost tracking, reporting, and change processes are clearly defined and visible to the Owner
2. **Demonstrate control**: Budget control mechanisms prevent uncontrolled cost growth and changes are properly authorized
3. **Align with pricing approach**: Plan is consistent with Appendix H pricing structure and assumptions (DEL-05-03)
4. **Support evaluation objectives**: Plan contributes positively to Project Delivery Plan evaluation score (OBJ-002: 10 points) [Source: Decomposition §15]

**Acceptance Criteria Alignment Note** [Lensing: X-007 — reliable compliance consistency]:
_CONTEXT.md states acceptance criteria as "Shows transparency and control; consistent with pricing approach" without explicitly referencing evaluation scoring. This Specification adds evaluation scoring (item 4) as a derived acceptance criterion from Decomposition §15. Both criteria sets apply; the Specification acceptance criteria are the integrated, canonical set.

**Submission Readiness Gate** [Lensing: E-002 — authoritative sufficiency certification]:
The plan is ready for submission when:
- All verification table statuses are Verified or Waived (with documented rationale for waivers)
- Internal review (Procedure Step 9) completed with sign-off
- Cross-reference check against Appendix H (DEL-05-01/02/03) confirms no contradictions
- PM or Proposal Manager attests that plan meets all acceptance criteria
