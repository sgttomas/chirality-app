# Deliverable: DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable articulates the physical execution strategy for constructing a municipal facility under a Design-Build delivery model, encompassing work staging and sequencing, site logistics coordination, safety management, and construction administration. It must demonstrate feasibility and risk control within site-specific constraints while aligning with the proposed design concept and project schedule.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
