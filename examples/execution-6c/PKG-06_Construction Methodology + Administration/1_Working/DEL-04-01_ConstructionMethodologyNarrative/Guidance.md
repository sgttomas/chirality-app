# Guidance: DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists

The Construction Methodology Narrative exists to demonstrate to the evaluation panel (Town of Penhold) that the Design-Build team has:

1. **Thought through the physical execution of the project** with sufficient rigor and realism to inspire confidence
2. **Identified and addressed the key construction challenges** specific to this site and this facility type (integrated Fire Hall + Public Works)
3. **Developed a feasible, risk-controlled approach** that aligns with the proposed design concept, schedule, and budget
4. **Understood the regulatory, safety, and environmental context** for construction in the Town of Penhold

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk: Project Delivery Plan — 10 points); `_CONTEXT.md` (Acceptance Criteria: "Addresses Section 7.2 headings; demonstrates feasibility and risk control")

### Role in Proposal Evaluation

The Construction Methodology Narrative is a **scored component** of the Project Delivery Plan evaluation criterion (10 points out of 100 total proposal points). It is one of several narratives (along with design methodology, schedule, commissioning/closeout, etc.) that collectively demonstrate the team's ability to deliver the project successfully.

**Governance Imperative:** Construction Methodology Narrative is produced as part of proposal submission (RFP mandatory). It serves two governance purposes:
1. **COMPLIANCE governance:** Demonstrate mandatory compliance with RFP Section 7.2 construction methodology requirements (pass/fail gate for proposal)
2. **QUALITY governance:** Maximize evaluation score for Project Delivery Plan criterion (10 points out of 100 total)

These governance imperatives drive content prioritization, detail level, and review focus. Compliance is non-negotiable; score maximization is secondary. *(Source: Lensing Item D-001)*

**Regulatory Accountability Baseline (non-negotiable for acceptable evaluation score):**
1. Narrative addresses all RFP Section 7.2 required headings (comprehensive coverage)
2. Narrative demonstrates Alberta OHS compliance (safety is fundamental accountability)
3. Narrative acknowledges site constraints from Addendum 03 and reference documents (shows constraint awareness)

Narrative failing regulatory baseline is at high risk for low evaluation score regardless of other quality factors. Regulatory accountability is essential, not optional. *(Source: Lensing Item E-001)*

**Evaluator Perspective:** Evaluators are assessing whether the construction approach is:
- **Clear and specific** (not generic boilerplate)
- **Realistic and feasible** (accounts for site constraints, schedule, and complexity)
- **Risk-aware** (identifies and mitigates key construction risks)
- **Credible** (team demonstrates construction management competence and Design-Build experience)

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 6 (Objectives — OBJ-002: Maximize Project Delivery Plan score); Section 15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk)

### Downstream Use

This narrative will be used by:

1. **Evaluation Panel (Immediate Use):** To score the proposal's construction approach and assess team credibility
2. **Owner and Project Team (Post-Award):** As a baseline construction execution framework for detailed construction planning during design development and construction mobilization
3. **Construction Manager and Superintendent (Post-Award):** As a reference for developing detailed site logistics plans, safety plans, and construction sequences

**Note:** The narrative is a **proposal document**, not a construction execution plan. It provides a credible framework that will be refined and detailed during design development and pre-construction planning.

**Source:** Inferred from deliverable purpose (proposal component) and Design-Build delivery model (construction planning continues post-award during design refinement)

---

## Quality Imperative

Narrative must achieve minimum quality threshold across five dimensions: *(Source: Lensing Item F-009)*

1. **COMPLIANCE:** Addresses all RFP Section 7.2 requirements
2. **SPECIFICITY:** Project-tailored, not generic; references site features and technical requirements
3. **FEASIBILITY:** Realistic and achievable; not aspirational or overpromising
4. **RISK-AWARENESS:** Acknowledges major construction risks and describes mitigation
5. **CLARITY:** Clear, well-organized, persuasive for evaluation panel scoring

Narrative failing any dimension is at high risk for low evaluation score. Reviewers must assess narrative against all five dimensions before submission.

---

## Principles

### Principle 1: Feasibility Over Aspiration

**Statement:** The construction methodology must be **feasible and realistic**, not aspirational or overly optimistic. Overpromising in the proposal creates execution risk post-award.

**Rationale:** In a Design-Build proposal, the construction methodology is a commitment to a delivery approach. If the approach is unrealistic (e.g., overly aggressive schedule, insufficient site access, inadequate safety measures), the team will face cost overruns, delays, and Owner dissatisfaction post-award.

**Application to This Deliverable:**
- Staging and sequencing must account for **actual site constraints** (12-acre developable area, flood fringe, wetland proximity, geotechnical conditions)
- Logistics must account for **real access limitations** (public roadway access, adjacent development, material delivery routes)
- Safety measures must be **site-specific and comprehensive**, not generic statements
- Utilities approach must account for **coordination needs** with Town of Penhold services and survey data availability post-award

**Site Constraint Evidence (to be populated after reference document reading):** After site reference documents are summarized, update this principle with specific examples. Staging must account for actual site constraints such as: [specific geotechnical condition from Geotech Report], [specific wetland buffer requirement from Wetland Assessment], [specific flood impact from Flood Zone Mapping], [specific slope/grading limitation from Site Grading Plan]. *(Source: Lensing Item B-003)*

**Enforcement Mechanism:** Construction Manager and Proposal Manager jointly review narrative for overpromising:
1. Each staged phase duration is realistic (consult scheduling experience and reference projects)
2. Each equipment requirement is achievable (consult with equipment vendors/subcontractors)
3. Each logistical claim is physically feasible on 12-acre site (consult with site planner)
4. Each safety measure is implementable within budget/schedule (consult with Safety Lead)

Flag any claim that appears optimistic; require revision or mark as assumption requiring post-award validation. *(Source: Lensing Item D-002)*

**Post-Award Execution Viability:** Narrative must enable post-award execution by:
1. Identifying which detailed plans must be developed during pre-construction phase (construction sequencing plan, safety plan, logistics plan)
2. Identifying which external inputs are needed to finalize plans (survey data, final design, final schedule)
3. Identifying coordination protocols and decision gates for plan finalization
4. Providing sufficient baseline detail that pre-construction team has clear starting point for detailed planning (not blank slate)

Narrative is not the execution plan, but it must be operationalization-ready. *(Source: Lensing Item E-002)*

### Principle 2: Risk Awareness and Transparency

**Statement:** The construction methodology should **identify and address key construction risks** explicitly, demonstrating that the team understands the challenges and has mitigation strategies.

**Rationale:** Construction is inherently uncertain. Evaluators respect teams that acknowledge risks and demonstrate proactive mitigation planning. Hiding or ignoring risks signals naivety or inexperience.

**Application to This Deliverable:**
- **Site risks** (flood zone, wetlands, geotechnical conditions) should be acknowledged and addressed with mitigation strategies (e.g., dewatering plans, environmental controls, foundation design coordination)
- **Schedule risks** (weather delays, long-lead procurement, permitting gates) should be acknowledged and addressed with contingency planning
- **Safety risks** (public proximity, environmental hazards, equipment operations) should be acknowledged and addressed with safety protocols and emergency response planning
- **Coordination risks** (adjacent development, utility tie-ins, survey data timing) should be acknowledged and addressed with communication and coordination protocols

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 9 (PKG-09 — Due Diligence & Risk Register); SOW-026 (risk management plan); `_CONTEXT.md` (Acceptance Criteria: "demonstrates feasibility and risk control")

---

### Principle 3: Integration with Design and Schedule

**Statement:** The construction methodology is **not independent** of the design concept and project schedule. It must be **coordinated and aligned** to demonstrate that the proposed concept is buildable within the proposed schedule.

**Rationale:** Construction methodology, design concept, and schedule are interdependent. A buildable design concept requires a feasible construction approach; a credible schedule requires a realistic construction methodology. Misalignment between these elements signals poor coordination and undermines proposal credibility.

**Application to This Deliverable:**
- Construction staging and sequencing must align with the **building configuration and structural system** from DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package)
- Site logistics must align with the **site layout** (access drives, parking, building location) from DEL-02-01
- Construction durations and critical path activities must align with the **project schedule** from DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule)
- Special technical requirements (16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready roof) must be addressed in construction approach

**Source:** `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (NOT_TRACKED mode — coordination managed externally); Specification requirements R-09 (Coordination with Design Concept) and R-10 (Coordination with Project Schedule)

---

### Principle 4: Safety as a Core Value, Not an Afterthought

**Statement:** Site safety is **not a checklist item** to be addressed minimally. It is a **core value** that must be embedded throughout the construction methodology.

**Rationale:** Construction safety is a regulatory requirement (Alberta OHS Act) and a moral obligation. Accidents and injuries are preventable with proper planning, training, and controls. Evaluators assess whether the team takes safety seriously and has the culture and systems to execute safely.

**Application to This Deliverable:**
- Safety management framework must be **comprehensive and site-specific**, not generic
- Hazard identification must address **actual site hazards** (equipment operations, excavation, working at heights, public proximity, environmental hazards)
- Emergency response planning must be **realistic and actionable** (first aid, evacuation, spill response, weather event response)
- Worker safety protocols must be **ongoing and systematic** (orientations, toolbox talks, inspections, reporting)
- Public safety considerations must be addressed explicitly (municipal facility; potential for public activity during construction)

**Source:** Specification requirement R-04 (Site Safety Management); Alberta OHS Act and regulations (regulatory baseline); construction management best practice

---

### Principle 5: Clarity and Specificity Over Generic Boilerplate

**Statement:** The construction methodology narrative must be **specific to this project and this site**, not a generic template that could apply to any project.

**Rationale:** Evaluators can distinguish between a tailored, project-specific narrative and generic boilerplate. Generic narratives signal lack of engagement with the project's unique challenges and constraints. Specific narratives demonstrate that the team has studied the site, understood the constraints, and developed a thoughtful approach.

**Application to This Deliverable:**
- Reference **specific site features** (12-acre developable area, flood fringe dog park/storm pond, adjacent subdivision, wetland proximity)
- Reference **specific facility requirements** (Fire Hall + Public Works integration, 16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready roof)
- Reference **specific site reference documents** (Geotechnical Report, Wetland Assessment, Flood Zone Mapping, Site Grading Plan)
- Reference **Town of Penhold context** (municipal standards, utility coordination, permitting process)

**Merit Substantiation Criteria:** Sufficient merit substantiation includes: *(Source: Lensing Item E-003)*
1. Minimum three site-specific references (e.g., 12-acre developable area, flood fringe constraints, adjacent development context) demonstrating site knowledge
2. Minimum two facility-specific references (e.g., integrated Fire Hall/Public Works, special technical requirements) showing functional understanding
3. Minimum one constraint-specific mitigation strategy (e.g., "flood fringe exclusion limits laydown area; mitigation approach is [specific]") showing problem-solving
4. Baseline schedule/duration assumptions specific to this project (not generic)
5. Team/subcontractor experience references relevant to this project type

Narrative meeting these substantiation criteria demonstrates sufficient merit. Narrative lacking any of these criteria is at risk for evaluator perception of generic/insufficient engagement.

## Considerations

### Factor 1: Site Access and Laydown Area Constraints

**Context:** The 12-acre developable area (excluding 8-acre flood fringe dog park/storm pond area) limits available space for construction staging, laydown areas, and equipment deployment. The site is also constrained by wetland proximity and potential coordination needs with adjacent development.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Large centralized laydown area** (efficient but may consume too much developable area; may conflict with site grading or landscaping work)
- **Multiple smaller laydown areas** (preserves flexibility but increases material handling and coordination complexity)
- **Just-in-time delivery** (minimizes on-site storage needs but increases schedule risk if deliveries are delayed)
- **Off-site staging area** (preserves on-site space but increases transportation costs and logistics complexity)

**Recommendation:** **ASSUMPTION** — Laydown strategy should be coordinated with site concept (from DEL-02-01) and site grading plan. Hybrid approach (modest on-site laydown area + just-in-time delivery for long-lead items) may be most feasible. Off-site staging may be needed for large equipment or bulk materials if on-site space is insufficient.

**Source:** Specification requirement R-03 (Site Access and Logistics); decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03 — 12-acre developable area constraint)

---

### Factor 2: Weather and Seasonality

**Context:** Construction in Alberta is subject to seasonal weather constraints (winter cold, spring thaw, summer heat, precipitation). The project schedule must account for weather-sensitive activities (concrete placement, earthwork, roofing, exterior finishes).

**Trade-offs:**
- **Year-round construction** (maximizes schedule continuity but increases cost for winter construction measures: heating, enclosures, cold-weather concrete)
- **Seasonal construction shutdown** (avoids winter construction costs but extends overall project duration)
- **Weather-protected staging** (enclose building early to enable interior work during winter; requires early structural enclosure milestone)

**Recommendation:** **ASSUMPTION** — Construction approach should prioritize **early enclosure** to enable weather-protected interior work during winter months. Foundation and structural work should be scheduled to avoid deep winter if possible. Coordinate with DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) to define seasonal assumptions and weather contingency.

**Source:** Construction management best practice for Alberta climate; Specification requirement R-10 (Coordination with Project Schedule)

---

### Factor 3: Public Safety and Operational Continuity

**Context:** The Public Services Building is a municipal facility (Fire Hall + Public Works). While the building is new construction (not renovation of occupied facility), the site may be adjacent to existing municipal operations or public areas. Public safety during construction must be addressed.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Aggressive site security** (fencing, signage, restricted access) protects public safety but may create negative perception (project as intrusion on public space)
- **Open site with public engagement** (visible construction, community outreach) fosters positive perception but increases public safety risk and coordination complexity
- **Coordination with emergency services** (ensure fire department access to site for emergencies; coordinate with Town's emergency response planning)

**Recommendation:** **ASSUMPTION** — Site security and public safety measures should be **comprehensive and visible** (fencing, signage, barriers) but balanced with community engagement (project signage, progress updates, coordination with Town). Coordinate with DEL-04-03 (Communications and Reporting Plan) for stakeholder touchpoints. Ensure emergency access routes are maintained throughout construction.

**Source:** Specification requirement R-04 (Site Safety Management: public safety considerations); municipal facility context

---

### Factor 4: Environmental and Regulatory Compliance

**Context:** The site is constrained by wetland proximity (per Wetland Assessment) and flood zone context (per Flood Zone Mapping). Construction activities must comply with environmental regulations (if wetlands or watercourses are affected) and municipal standards (grading, drainage, erosion control).

**Trade-offs:**
- **Conservative construction setbacks** (avoid wetland/watercourse impact) may limit construction access or staging areas
- **Aggressive construction approach** (work closer to wetland/watercourse boundaries) may require permitting, monitoring, or mitigation measures (cost and schedule impact)
- **Erosion and sediment control measures** (silt fencing, straw bales, construction entrance stabilization) add cost but are required for compliance and environmental protection

**Recommendation:** **ASSUMPTION** — Construction approach should include **explicit environmental protection measures** (erosion/sediment control, wetland buffer zones, spill prevention/response, waste management). Coordinate with DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary) for detailed environmental constraints and mitigation strategies. Budget and schedule should include contingency for environmental permitting or monitoring if required.

**Source:** Specification requirement R-08 (Coordination with Site Constraints: wetland proximity, flood zone context); SOW-025 (site due diligence summary)

---

### Factor 5: Coordination with Detailed Design Development

**Context:** In a Design-Build delivery model, the construction methodology narrative is written **before detailed design is complete**. The narrative must be flexible enough to accommodate design refinement during design development post-award, while still demonstrating a credible baseline approach.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Highly specific construction approach** (detailed staging, specific equipment, precise durations) demonstrates rigor but creates inflexibility if design changes during development
- **Generic construction approach** (high-level staging, equipment "TBD", broad durations) preserves flexibility but undermines proposal credibility
- **Framework approach with refinement gates** (define baseline staging and logistics framework; commit to refinement milestones during design development) balances credibility and flexibility

**Recommendation:** **ASSUMPTION** — Construction methodology narrative should provide **sufficient detail to demonstrate feasibility and credibility** (specific staging phases, site access strategy, safety framework) while acknowledging that **detailed construction planning will be refined during design development and pre-construction** (specific equipment selections, detailed schedules, subcontractor coordination plans). Use language like "preliminary staging approach" or "baseline logistics framework" to signal appropriate level of refinement.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Speed vs. Cost vs. Safety

**Competing Concerns:**
- **Speed:** Accelerated construction schedule reduces project duration and enables earlier occupancy; may maximize evaluation score for schedule (if schedule is scored)
- **Cost:** Cost-efficient construction approach minimizes project cost and maximizes competitiveness on price (35 points for price in evaluation criteria)
- **Safety:** Comprehensive safety measures protect workers and public; required for regulatory compliance and moral obligation; may add cost or extend schedule

**Resolution Approach:**
- **Priority:** Safety is **non-negotiable** (regulatory and moral requirement). Speed and cost must be optimized **within safe execution constraints**.
- **Strategy:** Identify opportunities to improve schedule and cost **without compromising safety** (e.g., efficient staging, prefabrication, value engineering, logistics optimization). Where safety measures add cost or time, include them and ensure they are accounted for in budget and schedule.

**Judgment Framework for Safety Trade-offs:** When schedule or cost pressures arise, apply decision authority hierarchy: *(Source: Lensing Item B-009)*
1. Non-negotiable safety requirements (Alberta OHS compliance, site-specific hazards) always take priority
2. Mitigation costs (e.g., dewatering, environmental controls) are budgeted regardless of cost pressure
3. Schedule trade-offs (e.g., winter construction contingency) are absorbed rather than compromising safety
4. Final judgment authority: Construction Manager + Project Manager + Safety Lead (tri-party decision for any safety-impacting trade-off). Escalate to senior management if consensus cannot be reached.

**Source:** Specification requirement R-04 (Site Safety Management); decomposition document Section 15 (Price evaluation: 35 points — significant but not exclusive criterion)

---

### Trade-off 2: Just-in-Time Delivery vs. Bulk Storage

**Competing Concerns:**
- **Just-in-Time Delivery:** Minimizes on-site storage needs and material handling; preserves space for construction operations; reduces risk of material damage or theft
- **Bulk Storage:** Provides buffer against delivery delays; enables bulk purchasing discounts; reduces coordination complexity with suppliers

**Resolution Approach:**
- **Hybrid Strategy:** Use just-in-time delivery for **long-lead items with reliable delivery** (pre-engineered systems, specialty equipment) and bulk storage for **commodity items with uncertain lead times** (lumber, drywall, bulk materials).
- **Laydown Area Sizing:** Coordinate laydown area sizing with site concept (from DEL-02-01) to ensure sufficient space for bulk storage of critical materials without consuming excessive developable area.

**Source:** Specification requirement R-03 (Site Access and Logistics), R-06 (Transportation and Storage); Consideration Factor 1 (Site Access and Laydown Area Constraints)

---

### Trade-off 3: Winter Construction vs. Schedule Extension

**Competing Concerns:**
- **Winter Construction:** Enables year-round progress and shorter overall project duration; adds cost for winter construction measures (heating, enclosures, cold-weather concrete)
- **Schedule Extension:** Avoids winter construction costs by shutting down during winter months; extends overall project duration and delays occupancy

**Resolution Approach:**
- **Early Enclosure Strategy:** Prioritize early structural enclosure to enable weather-protected interior work during winter months. Foundation and structural work scheduled for warmer months (spring/summer/fall) to avoid deep winter concrete placement and steel erection challenges.
- **Contingency Planning:** Include weather contingency in schedule (per DEL-08-01) to account for weather delays without committing to full winter shutdown.

**Source:** Consideration Factor 2 (Weather and Seasonality); Alberta climate context

---

### Trade-off 4: Site Access Route Selection (Public Roadway vs. Temporary Access)

**Competing Concerns:**
- **Public Roadway Access:** Uses existing public roadways for material delivery and equipment access; simpler and lower cost; may create traffic disruption or public perception issues
- **Temporary Access Route:** Constructs temporary access route (if feasible) to minimize public roadway use; reduces traffic disruption and public perception concerns; adds cost and schedule for temporary access construction and restoration

**Resolution Approach:**
- **Coordinate with Site Concept:** Site access strategy depends on building location and site layout (from DEL-02-01). If building is accessible from existing roadway with minimal disruption, use public roadway access. If building location requires extensive use of public roadways or creates significant disruption, evaluate temporary access route feasibility.
- **Coordinate with Town of Penhold:** Traffic management and roadway use during construction should be coordinated with Town (per DEL-04-03: Communications and Reporting Plan). Obtain necessary permits or approvals for public roadway use or temporary closures.

## Examples

### Example 1: Staging Strategy for Integrated Fire Hall + Public Works Facility

**Context:** The Public Services Building integrates Fire Hall functions (apparatus bays, fire administration, FF&E, training areas) and Public Works functions (vehicle storage, maintenance bays, office/admin, outdoor storage/yard). The two functions may have different staging priorities or operational constraints.

**Example Staging Approach (Illustrative):**

**Phase 1: Site Mobilization and Preparation**
- Site fencing and access control
- Temporary utilities setup (power, water, sanitation)
- Erosion and sediment control measures
- Survey and layout (note: survey files provided post-award per Addendum 03)
- Clearing and grubbing (if needed)

**Phase 2: Foundation and Below-Grade Work**
- Excavation and dewatering (coordinate with geotechnical recommendations)
- Foundation construction (footings, grade beams, slab-on-grade)
- Underground utilities (service tie-ins; coordinate with Town; allowance approach per Addendum 03)
- Bay sumps installation (apparatus bays)

**Phase 3: Structural Framing and Enclosure**
- Structural steel or pre-engineered building system erection
- Roof structure installation (coordinate with solar-ready provisions per Addendum 03)
- Exterior enclosure (walls, windows, overhead doors — note 16 ft height requirement)
- **Milestone:** Building enclosed and weather-protected (enables interior work during winter if applicable)

**Phase 4: MEP Rough-In and Systems Installation**
- Mechanical systems (HVAC, plumbing, fire protection)
- Electrical systems (power distribution, lighting, fire alarm, emergency generator installation)
- Specialty systems (fire apparatus exhaust extraction, fill stations, access control — per Additional Option 3 if selected)

**Phase 5: Interior Fit-Out and Finishes**
- Interior partitions and finishes (drywall, flooring, ceilings, paint)
- Casework and fixtures installation
- FF&E installation (if included in base scope; coordinate with OI-004 — FF&E treatment TBD)

**Phase 6: Site Work and Landscaping**
- Site grading and drainage (coordinate with site grading plan)
- Paving (drives, parking, apron areas)
- Landscaping and erosion protection
- Yard lighting (if Additional Option 2 selected)
- Exterior signage (if Additional Option 5 selected)

**Phase 7: Commissioning and Closeout**
- Systems testing and commissioning (coordinate with DEL-06-01)
- Substantial completion walk-through and deficiency list
- Training (coordinate with DEL-06-01)
- Final cleaning and turnover
- Warranty period support (12-month all-inclusive warranty baseline per RFP)

**Phasing Sequence Rationale:** The staging sequence above prioritizes: *(Source: Lensing Item B-006)*
1. Early site stabilization and erosion control (regulatory compliance)
2. Foundation completion (critical path)
3. Early enclosure for weather protection (Alberta climate)
4. Interior work during winter months
5. Site work and landscaping final (minimal disruption to completed building)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard Design-Build staging framework adapted for this project type. Specific phasing must be coordinated with design concept (from DEL-02-01) and project schedule (from DEL-08-01).

---

### Example 2: Site Logistics Plan (Conceptual)

**Context:** Site logistics must account for 12-acre developable area constraint, flood fringe area exclusion, and coordination with site concept.

**Example Logistics Elements (Illustrative):**

- **Primary Site Access:** Via public roadway (existing roadway TBD; coordinate with site concept from DEL-02-01 and adjacent subdivision design reference)
- **Construction Entrance:** Stabilized construction entrance (gravel pad + tire wash or rumble strips to minimize mud tracking onto public roadway)
- **Laydown Area:** Designated laydown area for material storage (location TBD; coordinate with site concept to avoid conflict with building footprint, parking, or landscaping)
- **Equipment Staging:** Designated equipment staging area (for crane, concrete trucks, excavators, etc.; location TBD; coordinate with building location and access routes)
- **Temporary Facilities:** Temporary office trailer, worker break area, portable sanitation, temporary power/water tie-ins (location TBD; near site access for convenience)
- **Waste Management:** Dumpsters and recycling bins (location TBD; near laydown area for efficient waste handling)
- **Environmental Controls:** Erosion/sediment control perimeter (silt fencing along site boundaries; straw bales or sediment traps at low points; coordinate with site grading plan)
- **Safety Perimeter:** Site fencing with signage (no public access; coordinate with public safety considerations per Consideration Factor 3)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard construction logistics framework adapted for this project. Specific locations and configurations **TBD** (require site concept from DEL-02-01 and site condition analysis from DEL-09-02).

---

### Example 3: Safety Management Framework (Conceptual)

**Context:** Site safety management must be comprehensive and site-specific, addressing regulatory requirements (Alberta OHS) and project-specific hazards.

**Example Safety Framework Elements (Illustrative):**

**1. Safety Accountability Structure**
- Construction Manager: Overall site safety responsibility and accountability
- Site Superintendent: Day-to-day safety oversight and enforcement
- Safety Officer / Coordinator: Safety planning, training, inspections, reporting (dedicated role or shared responsibility depending on project size)
- Subcontractors: Responsible for safety of their own workers and compliance with site safety plan

**2. Safety Planning and Documentation**
- Site-Specific Safety Plan: Comprehensive safety plan addressing site hazards, safety protocols, emergency response, training requirements (developed pre-construction; updated as needed)
- Job Hazard Analyses (JHAs): Task-specific hazard analyses for high-risk activities (excavation, working at heights, equipment operations, confined space entry, etc.)
- Safety Data Sheets (SDS): Accessible SDS library for all hazardous materials on site

**3. Worker Safety Training and Communication**
- New Worker Orientation: Mandatory safety orientation for all workers before site access (covers site hazards, safety protocols, emergency procedures, PPE requirements)
- Toolbox Talks: Weekly safety meetings with all site personnel (topic-specific: seasonal hazards, recent incidents, new procedures)
- Site Safety Signage: Visible safety signage throughout site (PPE requirements, hazard warnings, emergency contact information, first aid station location)

**4. Hazard Controls and Mitigation**
- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Mandatory PPE for all site personnel (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests, steel-toed boots; task-specific PPE as needed: fall protection, respiratory protection, hearing protection)
- Fall Protection: Guardrails, safety nets, or personal fall arrest systems for work at heights (structural steel erection, roofing, equipment installation)
- Excavation Safety: Shoring, sloping, or benching for excavations >4 ft depth (per Alberta OHS); daily excavation inspections
- Equipment Safety: Pre-operation inspections, operator certification verification, exclusion zones around equipment operations
- Environmental Hazard Controls: Spill prevention/response kits, wetland buffer zones, dust control measures

**5. Emergency Response Planning**
- First Aid: Designated first aid attendant(s) on site during work hours; first aid station with supplies
- Emergency Contacts: Posted emergency contact information (ambulance, fire, police, site management, Owner contact)
- Evacuation Plan: Site evacuation routes and muster points (for fire, hazardous material spill, weather event)
- Incident Reporting: Incident investigation and reporting procedures (immediate reporting of injuries, near-misses, or hazardous conditions; root cause analysis and corrective actions)

**6. Safety Inspections and Monitoring**
- Daily Site Inspections: Daily walk-through by Site Superintendent or Safety Officer (identify hazards, verify compliance, address deficiencies)
- Weekly Safety Meetings: Weekly safety meetings with site management and subcontractors (review incidents, discuss upcoming high-risk activities, reinforce safety expectations)
- Monthly Safety Audits: Monthly comprehensive safety audit (documentation review, worker interviews, physical inspection; identify systemic issues and improvement opportunities)

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard construction safety framework adapted for this project and Alberta OHS requirements. Specific hazard controls and mitigation measures **TBD** (require site condition analysis from DEL-09-02 and design concept from DEL-02-01).
