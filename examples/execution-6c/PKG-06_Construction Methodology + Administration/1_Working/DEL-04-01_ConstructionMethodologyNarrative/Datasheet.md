*(Source: Lensing Item B-001)*

**Survey Data Timing Clarification:** Pre-award construction methodology must be based on reference documents available now (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, flood, grading) plus site grading plan. Survey data (post-award per Addendum 03) will enable detailed construction planning refinement. Narrative should state: "Detailed surveying and layout procedures will be finalized upon receipt of survey files post-award." *(Source: Lensing Item B-005)*

**Note:** Detailed site condition implications are addressed in DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary). Construction methodology must account for these constraints.

## Construction

### Narrative Structure (Anticipated)
The Construction Methodology Narrative must address the following structural elements (derived from RFP Section 7.2 requirements and acceptance criteria):

1. **Staging of Work**
   - Phasing strategy (if applicable)
   - Sequencing of major construction activities
   - Site mobilization and demobilization approach

2. **Logistics**
   - Site access and egress planning
   - Laydown areas and material storage strategy
   - Equipment deployment and circulation
   - Coordination with adjacent development (if applicable)
   - Coordination with flood fringe area (dog park/storm pond) constraints

3. **Site Safety**
   - Safety management framework
   - Hazard identification and mitigation
   - Emergency response planning
   - Worker safety protocols
   - Public safety considerations (municipal facility; potential for adjacent activity)

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md` (Description and Acceptance Criteria fields); SOW-019 (construction methodology: staging, logistics, safety); `_REFERENCES.md` (RFP Section 7.2 reference)

### Related Construction Administration Elements
The narrative may also incorporate or reference elements from SOW-020 (construction administration):

- **Cleaning Approach:** Site housekeeping and waste management during construction
- **Transportation & Storage:** Material handling and storage protocols
- **Site Services / Utilities Approach:** Temporary utilities strategy (power, water, sanitation) and tie-in coordination with permanent services

**Source:** `_REFERENCES.md` (RFP Section 7.3.1–7.3.3 reference); SOW-020 (construction admin narrative)

**Note:** The boundary between DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative) and related deliverables (DEL-04-02 Budget Control, DEL-04-03 Communications/Reporting, DEL-06-01 Commissioning/Closeout) is defined by the package structure. This deliverable focuses on **physical construction approach and site execution**; budget/change management, communications cadence, and post-construction activities are addressed in other deliverables.
