# Specification: DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable covers the construction methodology narrative for the Public Services Building Design-Build proposal, specifically addressing:

1. **Staging of Work:** Phasing strategy, sequencing of major construction activities, site mobilization and demobilization approach
2. **Logistics:** Site access/egress planning, laydown areas, material storage, equipment deployment, coordination with site constraints
3. **Site Safety:** Safety management framework, hazard identification and mitigation, emergency response, worker and public safety protocols
4. **Construction Administration Elements:** Cleaning approach, transportation/storage protocols, site services/utilities approach (temporary and permanent tie-ins)

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md` (Description field); SOW-019 (construction methodology: staging, logistics, safety); SOW-020 (construction admin: cleaning, transport/storage, utilities); `_REFERENCES.md` (RFP Section 7.2, 7.3.1–7.3.3)

### Out of Scope
The following are addressed in other deliverables and are **excluded** from this narrative:

- **Budget Control and Change Management:** Covered in DEL-04-02
- **Communications and Reporting Cadence:** Covered in DEL-04-03
- **Commissioning, Training, Closeout, Warranty:** Covered in DEL-06-01
- **Detailed Project Schedule (Gantt/Milestones):** Covered in DEL-08-01
- **Risk Register (structured risk list with mitigations):** Covered in DEL-09-01
- **Site Conditions Due Diligence Summary (detailed site analysis):** Covered in DEL-09-02
- **Design Methodology:** Covered in DEL-03-01 (Design Methodology Narrative)
- **Detailed Design and Construction Documents Plan:** Covered in DEL-03-02

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 7 (Work Packages), Section 8 (Deliverables definitions)

### Boundary Clarifications
- **Physical Construction Approach:** This deliverable focuses on the **physical execution strategy** for construction (how work is staged, how site is managed, how safety is controlled).
- **Overlaps with Related Deliverables:** Some construction administration elements (cleaning, transport/storage, utilities) are included here per SOW-020; these are operational/logistical aspects of site execution, not budget, communications, or post-construction processes.
- **Schedule Alignment:** This narrative must align with DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) but does not replace the schedule. Construction methodology describes **how** work will be executed; the schedule describes **when** and **duration**.

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md` (Acceptance Criteria: "Addresses Section 7.2 headings; demonstrates feasibility and risk control"); decomposition document Section 10 (Scope Ledger — SOW-019/SOW-020 definitions)

## Requirements

### R-01: RFP Section 7.2 Compliance (Mandatory)
**Requirement:** The construction methodology narrative MUST address all headings and content requirements specified in RFP Section 7.2.

**Rationale:** Compliance with RFP structure is mandatory (per decomposition document Section 3, Constraint C-02: "Use the main headings and present information in the order in Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 to ensure full consideration").

**Enforcement:** ENFORCEABLE (RFP-mandated, non-waivable). This is the foundational governance requirement. *(Source: Lensing Item F-001)*

**Authority:** RFP Section 7.2 *(Source: Lensing Item C-004)*

**Verification:** Cross-check narrative structure against RFP Section 7.2 headings. Create explicit compliance checklist: [1] Required headings (list each), [2] Minimum content expectations for each heading, [3] Page limit or format guidance (if specified), [4] Evaluation criteria (what evaluators are scoring on). Use checklist to define acceptable compliance threshold. *(Source: Lensing Items A-003, C-003)*

**RFP Section 7.2 Compliance Checklist:** **TBD** — Extract RFP Section 7.2 requirements and create mapping table: RFP heading -> Specification requirement(s) addressing it. For each RFP heading, confirm at least one Specification requirement maps to it. If an RFP heading is not covered, add new requirement. Complete mapping before narrative drafting begins. *(Source: Lensing Item F-004)*

**Status:** **TBD** — RFP Section 7.2 detailed headings not yet extracted. High-level structure inferred from decomposition document and `_CONTEXT.md`.

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 3 (Constraint C-02); `_REFERENCES.md` (RFP Section 7.2 reference)

---

### R-02: Staging of Work
**Requirement:** The narrative must describe the phasing and sequencing strategy for major construction activities, including:
- Site mobilization and setup
- Foundation and below-grade work
- Structural framing and enclosure
- MEP rough-in and coordination
- Interior fit-out and finishes
- Site work and landscaping
- Commissioning and substantial completion
- Demobilization and closeout

**Rationale:** Staging strategy demonstrates feasibility and risk control (acceptance criterion). Sequencing affects schedule, cost, and coordination.

**Verification:** Narrative includes clear phasing description with logical dependencies between phases.

**Status:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard Design-Build staging framework inferred from construction management practice. Specific phasing must be tailored to site constraints (flood fringe area, adjacent development, wetland proximity) and design concept (from DEL-02-01).

**Source:** SOW-019 (construction methodology: staging of work); `_CONTEXT.md` (Acceptance Criteria: "demonstrates feasibility and risk control")

---

### R-03: Site Access and Logistics

- Public safety considerations (municipal facility; potential for adjacent public activity during construction)

**Enforcement:** ENFORCEABLE (RFP-mandated per Section 7.2 + Alberta OHS Act). *(Source: Lensing Item F-001)*

**Authority:** RFP Section 7.2 + Alberta OHS Act *(Source: Lensing Item C-004)*

**Comprehensive Safety Definition:** "Comprehensive" for this context means:
1. Regulatory baseline (Alberta OHS Act compliance)
2. Site-specific hazards (equipment operations, excavation, working heights, environmental hazards per site conditions)
3. Public safety measures (municipal facility context; potential adjacent public activity during construction)
4. Emergency response (first aid, evacuation, spill response, weather events)
5. Ongoing monitoring (daily inspections, weekly meetings, monthly audits)
*(Source: Lensing Item B-007)*

**Implementation Sufficiency:** Safety narrative must include sufficient detail to enable post-award implementation:
1. Accountability structure (clear roles for CM, Superintendent, Safety Officer, Subcontractors)
2. Safety planning approach (timeline for developing site-specific safety plan, pre-construction kick-off agenda)
3. Training/communication cadence (frequency and format of orientations, toolbox talks, safety meetings)
4. Hazard control standards (reference to Alberta OHS standards + site-specific protocols)
5. Emergency response readiness (first aid capability, evacuation plan, incident reporting)

Narrative does not need to specify exact training content or exact emergency procedures, but must demonstrate adequate capability framework. *(Source: Lensing Item F-007)*

**Rationale:** Site safety is a regulatory requirement (Alberta OHS Act and regulations) and a key evaluation criterion for demonstrating risk control and construction credibility.

**Verification:** Narrative includes comprehensive safety approach with clear roles, processes, and hazard-specific controls.

**Status:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard construction safety framework inferred from Alberta OHS requirements and industry best practice. Site-specific hazards **TBD** (require site condition analysis from DEL-09-02 and design concept from DEL-02-01).

**Source:** SOW-019 (construction methodology: site safety); `_CONTEXT.md` (Acceptance Criteria: "demonstrates feasibility and risk control"); Datasheet (Conditions: Alberta OHS Act and regulations — ASSUMPTION)

- Material delivery coordination (scheduling, receiving, inspection)
- On-site storage locations and protection measures (weather, security, damage prevention)
- Material handling equipment and procedures
- Coordination with laydown area strategy (from R-03)

**Rationale:** Construction administration requirement per RFP Section 7.3.2 (transportation/storage). Affects schedule (delivery lead times, just-in-time vs. bulk storage), cost (damage/loss), and site logistics.

**Verification:** Narrative includes clear material handling and storage protocols.

**Status:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard material handling practices inferred from industry best practice. Specific storage locations and capacity **TBD** (require site concept and laydown area planning from R-03).

**Source:** `_REFERENCES.md` (RFP Section 7.3.2 reference); SOW-020 (construction admin: transport/storage)

---

### R-07: Site Services and Utilities Approach
**Requirement:** The narrative must describe the approach to temporary and permanent utilities, including:
- Temporary utilities during construction (power, water, sanitation, site lighting, heating/ventilation for enclosed spaces)
- Permanent utility tie-ins (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electrical, gas, communications)
- Coordination with Town of Penhold utility services
- Allowance approach for service tie-ins (per Addendum 03: allowance permitted; tie-ins not required in proposal pricing)

**Rationale:** Construction administration requirement per RFP Section 7.3.3 (site services/utilities approach). Utilities are critical for construction execution and building operations. Addendum 03 clarifies that service tie-in costs may be treated as an allowance.

**Verification:** Narrative includes clear temporary and permanent utilities strategy. Allowance approach (if used) is stated and consistent with DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions).

**Status:** **ASSUMPTION** — Standard utilities approach inferred from municipal construction practice. Specific utility locations and tie-in points **TBD** (require site concept from DEL-02-01 and site servicing information from reference documents). Allowance approach **TBD** (coordination with pricing team required for consistency with DEL-05-03).

**Source:** `_REFERENCES.md` (RFP Section 7.3.3 reference); decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03 — service tie-ins allowance approach clarification); SOW-020 (construction admin: utilities)

---

### R-08: Coordination with Site Constraints
**Requirement:** The narrative SHOULD demonstrate awareness of and coordination with key site constraints, including:
- **12-acre developable area** (excluding 8-acre flood fringe dog park/storm pond area)
- **Flood zone context** (parcel in flood zone; flood fringe area affects staging and access)
- **Wetland proximity** (per Wetland Assessment; may affect access routes, equipment movement, environmental controls)
- **Geotechnical conditions** (per Geotechnical Investigation Report; affects foundation approach, excavation strategy, dewatering needs)
- **Adjacent development** (per adjacent subdivision design reference; may affect access coordination, utility routing)
- **Survey data availability** (post-award per Addendum 03)

**Enforcement:** ASPIRATIONAL (project guidance; helps maximize evaluation score). *(Source: Lensing Item F-001)*

**Authority:** Addendum 03 + decomposition SOW-025 *(Source: Lensing Item C-004)*

**Major Constraints Definition:** Narrative MUST explicitly address each of these major site constraints:
1. 12-acre developable area (excluding 8-acre flood fringe dog park/storm pond)
2. Flood zone context (parcel in flood zone)
3. Wetland proximity (per Wetland Assessment)
4. Geotechnical conditions (per Geotechnical Investigation Report)
5. Adjacent development (per adjacent subdivision design reference)
6. Survey data availability (post-award per Addendum 03)

Narrative must acknowledge each constraint and describe mitigation/coordination approach. *(Source: Lensing Item F-002)*

**Rationale:** Site constraints directly affect construction feasibility and risk. Demonstrating constraint awareness is essential for credibility and acceptance criteria ("demonstrates feasibility and risk control").

**Verification:** Narrative explicitly addresses each major site constraint and describes mitigation or coordination approach.

**Status:** **TBD** — Site constraint details require reading and summarizing reference documents (Geotechnical Report, Wetland Assessment, Flood Zone Mapping, Site Grading Plan, Adjacent Subdivision Design). High-level constraint awareness is captured here; detailed implications will be addressed in DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary) and integrated into this narrative during working sessions.

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 2 (Background Appendices), Section 4 (Addendum 03 — 12-acre developable area); SOW-025 (site due diligence summary)

---

### R-09: Coordination with Design Concept
**Requirement:** The construction methodology SHOULD align with the proposed conceptual design (from DEL-02-01), including:
- Building location and orientation on site
- Site access drives and parking layout
- Building massing and structural system (affects crane requirements, sequencing)
- Special technical requirements (16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready roof provisions)

**Enforcement:** ASPIRATIONAL (project guidance; helps maximize evaluation score). *(Source: Lensing Item F-001)*

**Authority:** Decomposition SOW-010 + Addendum 03 *(Source: Lensing Item C-004)*

**Critical Information Dependencies:** Construction methodology requires the following from DEL-02-01:
1. Site layout (access points, parking, building location)
2. Building footprint and structural system (affects crane requirements, sequencing)
3. Special technical requirements (16 ft doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, solar roof)
4. Site drainage and utility coordination
*(Source: Lensing Item B-004)*

**Special Technical Requirements (Construction Obligations):** Per Addendum 03, special technical parameters affect construction methodology (not just design factors) because they affect staging, sequencing, equipment requirements, and feasibility. Narrative MUST address how construction approach accommodates each:
- 16 ft overhead door height (affects crane deployment, structural erection)
- Bay sumps (require phased coordination with MEP systems)
- Exhaust extraction (requires coordination with HVAC)
- Generator (requires electrical coordination)
- Fill stations (require utility routing)
- Solar-ready roof (requires structural/orientation coordination)
*(Source: Lensing Item F-005)*

**Coordination Gate:** Before finalizing narrative (Procedure Step 7), PM must confirm cross-deliverable alignment:
1. Construction Manager + Lead Architect review proposed design concept and confirm buildability; document any concerns
2. If material concerns are identified, resolve or document conflict for human ruling
3. Sign-off that design alignment is confirmed (or conflicts documented) before narrative proceeds to proposal assembly
*(Source: Lensing Item F-008)*

**Rationale:** Construction methodology cannot be finalized without knowing the design concept. Methodology must demonstrate that the proposed concept is buildable within site constraints and schedule.

**Verification:** Narrative references design concept and describes how construction approach supports concept execution.

**Status:** **TBD** — Design concept is produced in DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package). Construction methodology in this deliverable must be coordinated with design concept. Since dependencies are NOT_TRACKED, coordination is managed externally by humans (per `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).

**Source:** `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (NOT_TRACKED mode); decomposition document Section 8 (DEL-02-01 definition); SOW-010 (embed program clarifications and special requirements into concept)

### R-10: Coordination with Project Schedule
**Requirement:** The construction methodology SHOULD align with the detailed project schedule (from DEL-08-01), including:
- Duration assumptions for major construction phases
- Critical path activities (long-lead procurement, weather-sensitive work, permitting gates)
- Milestone coordination (substantial completion, occupancy, warranty start)

**Enforcement:** ASPIRATIONAL (project guidance; helps maximize evaluation score). *(Source: Lensing Item F-001)*

**Authority:** Decomposition SOW-023 *(Source: Lensing Item C-004)*

**Coordination Gate:** Before finalizing narrative (Procedure Step 7), PM must confirm cross-deliverable alignment:
1. Construction Manager + Scheduler review project schedule and confirm consistency with narrative phasing/durations; document any concerns
2. If material concerns are identified, resolve or document conflict for human ruling
3. Sign-off that schedule alignment is confirmed (or conflicts documented) before narrative proceeds to proposal assembly
*(Source: Lensing Item F-008)*

**Rationale:** Construction methodology describes **how** work will be executed; the schedule describes **when** and **duration**. Methodology must be feasible within the proposed schedule.

**Verification:** Narrative references project schedule and describes how construction approach supports schedule execution. Duration assumptions are consistent with DEL-08-01.

**Status:** **TBD** — Detailed project schedule is produced in DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule). Construction methodology in this deliverable must be coordinated with schedule. Since dependencies are NOT_TRACKED, coordination is managed externally by humans (per `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).

**Source:** `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (NOT_TRACKED mode); decomposition document Section 8 (DEL-08-01 definition); SOW-023 (detailed project schedule with milestones and critical path)

### R-11: Feasibility and Risk Control Demonstration
**Requirement:** The construction methodology narrative SHOULD demonstrate feasibility and risk control to maximize evaluation score for Project Delivery Plan (10 points).

**Enforcement:** ASPIRATIONAL (evaluation scoring guidance). *(Source: Lensing Item F-001)*

**Authority:** Acceptance Criteria + Decomposition Evaluation Criteria *(Source: Lensing Item C-004)*

**Rationale:** Acceptance criterion from `_CONTEXT.md`: "Addresses Section 7.2 headings; demonstrates feasibility and risk control." Evaluation criterion from decomposition document Section 15: Project Delivery Plan scored at 10 points; construction methodology is a key component.

**Verification:** Narrative is clear, credible, and addresses all major construction execution risks. Evaluators can understand the approach and have confidence in the team's ability to execute.

**Verification Adequacy Criteria:** *(Source: Lensing Item D-005)*
1. Technical Review (R-02 through R-04): Reviewer provides written comments on compliance, completeness, clarity; author revises based on comments; expected 1-2 revision cycles before approval
2. Compliance Review (R-01, R-11): Proposal Manager cross-checks narrative against RFP Section 7.2 checklist; expected 0-1 revision cycle
3. Credibility Review (R-11): Senior Reviewer assesses evaluator perspective; may require substantial revision if narrative appears generic or unconvincing

**Status:** **QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENT** — Requires engineering judgment and proposal writing skill. Technical content from requirements R-01 through R-10 must be synthesized into a persuasive, credible narrative.
