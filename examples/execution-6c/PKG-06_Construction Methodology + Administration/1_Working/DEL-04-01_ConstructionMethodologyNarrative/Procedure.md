# Procedure: DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative

## Purpose

This procedure describes the process for **producing the Construction Methodology Narrative deliverable** (DEL-04-01) as part of the Public Services Building Design-Build proposal.

**Note:** This procedure addresses **deliverable production** (how to write and QA the narrative for proposal submission), **not construction execution** (how to build the facility). Construction execution procedures will be developed post-award during detailed construction planning.

**Source:** Agent instruction AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS.md, Section "Procedure Schema (dual-use + recursive)" — Procedure.md may describe production and/or operation of deliverable artifact depending on deliverable type and information available. For this deliverable (narrative document), the production procedure is the primary focus.

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

**Dependency Tracking Mode:** NOT_TRACKED (coordinated externally by humans per `_DEPENDENCIES.md`)

**Upstream Deliverables (Coordination Required):**
- **DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package):** Construction methodology must align with proposed site layout, building configuration, and special technical requirements. **Recommended coordination:** Draft construction methodology in parallel with concept design; synchronize during cross-deliverable review sessions.
- **DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule):** Construction methodology must align with project schedule durations, milestones, and critical path. **Recommended coordination:** Draft construction methodology in parallel with schedule; synchronize during cross-deliverable review sessions.
- **DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary):** Site constraints identified in due diligence summary inform construction methodology. **Recommended coordination:** Review site due diligence summary before finalizing construction methodology; integrate site constraint implications.

**Note:** Since dependencies are NOT_TRACKED, coordination timing and gates are managed externally by Proposal Manager and project team. The narrative can be drafted in parallel with upstream deliverables, with synchronization checkpoints scheduled by the team.

## Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Context Review

**Action:**
1. Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_STATUS.md` to understand deliverable scope, acceptance criteria, and available references
2. Read decomposition document (Section 1: Intake Summary, Section 4: Addendum 03 impacts, Section 7: Work Packages, Section 8: Deliverables, Section 10: Scope Ledger — SOW-019/SOW-020)
3. Read Pass 1 drafts of `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md` for context, requirements, and rationale
4. Identify **TBD items** from Pass 1 drafts that require external reference reading or coordination with upstream deliverables

**Responsible:** Construction Manager (with PM support for coordination)

**Output:** Clear understanding of deliverable scope, requirements, and information gaps

**Verification:** Construction Manager confirms understanding with PM; identifies priority TBD items for resolution

---

### Step 2: Access and Review External References

**Action:**
1. **RFP Section 7.2 and 7.3.1–7.3.3:** Read detailed requirements for construction methodology and construction administration. Extract specific headings, content expectations, and evaluation criteria. Resolve Specification requirement R-01 (RFP Section 7.2 Compliance — currently TBD).
2. **Addendum 03:** Review technical clarifications (already summarized in decomposition document Section 4; verify details if needed).
3. **Site Reference Documents:** Read and summarize key construction-relevant findings:
   - **Geotechnical Investigation Report:** Soil conditions, foundation recommendations, dewatering needs, excavation constraints
   - **Wetland Assessment:** Wetland buffer zones, environmental protection requirements, construction constraints
   - **Environmental Assessment:** Environmental hazards, contamination (if any), mitigation requirements
   - **Flood Zone Mapping:** Flood fringe area implications, drainage considerations, access constraints
   - **Site Grading Plan:** Existing grades, proposed grading, drainage patterns, cut/fill volumes
   - **Adjacent Subdivision Design:** Adjacent development context, coordination needs, shared access or utilities

**Responsible:** Construction Manager (technical reading); PM (coordination with DEL-09-02 author if site due diligence summary is available for cross-reference)

**Output:** Completed reference summaries; resolution of TBD items related to site conditions, RFP requirements, and technical clarifications

**Verification:** Construction Manager documents key findings and shares with PM for coordination with DEL-09-02 (if parallel development) or confirms alignment if DEL-09-02 is already available

**Note:** If PDF reading tools are not available (as in Pass 1), this step may require manual reading or coordination with team members who have access to PDF content. Alternatively, prioritize TBD items and proceed with narrative drafting using Pass 1 content, flagging items for resolution during working sessions.

---

### Step 3: Coordinate with Upstream Deliverables

**Action:**
1. **Coordinate with DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package):**
   - Review proposed site layout (building location, access drives, parking, developable area usage)
   - Review building configuration and structural system (affects crane requirements, construction sequencing)
   - Review special technical requirements (16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, apparatus exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready roof provisions)
   - Identify any buildability concerns or construction methodology implications

2. **Coordinate with DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule):**
   - Review proposed schedule durations for major construction phases
   - Review critical path activities and milestones
   - Verify construction methodology assumptions (phasing, sequencing) align with schedule
   - Identify any schedule risks or contingency needs

3. **Coordinate with DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary):**
   - Review site constraint summaries (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, flood, grading, adjacent development)
   - Verify construction methodology addresses site constraints and mitigation strategies
   - Identify any additional site risks or coordination needs

4. **Coordinate with DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions):**
   - Review pricing assumptions related to construction (allowances for service tie-ins, exclusions, contingency)
   - Verify construction methodology narrative is consistent with pricing assumptions (e.g., if service tie-ins are treated as allowance, utilities approach in narrative should acknowledge this)

**Operational Requirements:** *(Source: Lensing Item C-007)*
- Coordinator (PM) facilitates cross-deliverable coordination session(s) scheduled for: **TBD**
- Estimated effort: **TBD** hours of Construction Manager time
- Conflict escalation authority: PM (minor inconsistencies); Design Manager + Commercial Lead (material conflicts affecting feasibility or cost)
- Document decisions and confirm alignment before proceeding to Step 4
- Target completion: **TBD**

**Responsible:** Construction Manager (lead); PM (coordination facilitation); Estimator, Lead Architect, Scheduler (coordination counterparts)

**Output:** Coordination notes documenting alignment or identifying conflicts; resolution of cross-deliverable dependencies

**Verification:** PM facilitates cross-deliverable review session (if needed); documents coordination decisions and confirms alignment before narrative finalization

**Note:** Since dependencies are NOT_TRACKED, coordination timing and format are managed externally. Recommended approach: Schedule cross-deliverable coordination session(s) after draft narratives and concept/schedule are available; use session to synchronize and resolve conflicts.

---

### Step 4: Draft Construction Methodology Narrative

**Action:**
Using the content from `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, external reference summaries, and upstream deliverable coordination, draft the Construction Methodology Narrative covering:

**Section 1: Staging of Work** (per Specification R-02)
- Phasing strategy overview
- Sequencing of major construction activities (site mobilization → foundation → structural → MEP → finishes → site work → commissioning → closeout)
- Site mobilization and demobilization approach
- Critical path activities and schedule coordination

**Section 2: Logistics** (per Specification R-03)
- Site access and egress planning (primary access point, construction entrance, traffic management)
- Laydown areas and material storage strategy (location, capacity, security, weather protection)
- Equipment deployment and circulation (crane locations, concrete truck routes, excavator staging)
- Coordination with 12-acre developable area constraint and flood fringe exclusion
- Coordination with adjacent development (if applicable)

**Section 3: Site Safety** (per Specification R-04)
- Safety management framework and accountability structure
- Hazard identification and risk assessment process
- Site-specific hazards and mitigation measures (excavation, working at heights, equipment operations, environmental hazards, public proximity)
- Emergency response planning (first aid, evacuation, spill response, weather event response)
- Worker safety protocols (orientations, toolbox talks, inspections, PPE requirements)
- Public safety considerations (site fencing, signage, coordination with Town)

**Section 4: Construction Administration** (per Specification R-05, R-06, R-07)
- Cleaning approach (daily housekeeping, waste management, final cleaning)
- Transportation and storage (material delivery coordination, handling procedures, storage protection)
- Site services and utilities approach (temporary utilities during construction; permanent utility tie-ins and coordination with Town; allowance approach if applicable)

**Drafting Guidelines:**
- **Be specific and project-tailored:** Reference specific site features, facility requirements, and Town of Penhold context (per Guidance Principle 5)
- **Be feasible and realistic:** Avoid overpromising; account for site constraints and schedule realities (per Guidance Principle 1)
- **Be risk-aware and transparent:** Acknowledge key construction risks and describe mitigation strategies (per Guidance Principle 2)
- **Integrate with design and schedule:** Demonstrate alignment with concept design and project schedule (per Guidance Principle 3)
- **Emphasize safety as core value:** Provide comprehensive, site-specific safety approach (per Guidance Principle 4); **Safety framework structure from Guidance Example 3 (accountability, planning, training, hazard controls, emergency response, monitoring) is the required baseline** — address each element or document why omitted *(Source: Lensing Item C-005)*
- **Cite sources:** Reference RFP sections, addenda, site reference documents, design concept, schedule as applicable
- **Mark TBDs:** If information is still unavailable after Step 2 and Step 3, mark as **TBD** and flag for resolution before final submission
- **Address special technical requirements:** Narrative Section 1 (Staging of Work) must explicitly address how construction approach accommodates each special parameter per Addendum 03 (16 ft doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready roof) *(Source: Lensing Item F-005)*
- **Ensure operability post-award:** Narrative must be operable post-award by: [1] identifying which decisions must be made before construction starts (pre-construction gate items), [2] identifying which details will be refined during design development (design refinement gates), [3] identifying which items depend on survey data post-award (survey data refinement), [4] committing to pre-construction coordination protocols and timelines *(Source: Lensing Item F-006)*

**Responsible:** Construction Manager (primary author)

**Output:** Draft Construction Methodology Narrative (markdown or formatted document)

**Verification:** Self-review against Specification requirements (R-01 through R-11) and Guidance principles before advancing to Step 5

---

### Step 5: Internal Technical Review

**Action:**
Circulate draft narrative to internal reviewers for technical accuracy, completeness, and alignment review:

1. **PM Review:** Verify alignment with upstream deliverables (design concept, schedule, site due diligence, pricing assumptions); check for cross-deliverable consistency
2. **Estimator Review:** Verify consistency with pricing assumptions (allowances, exclusions) in DEL-05-03
3. **Safety Lead Review:** Verify comprehensiveness of safety approach; check regulatory compliance (Alberta OHS)
4. **Lead Architect Review:** Verify alignment with design concept (buildability, site layout); identify any constructability concerns
5. **Scheduler Review:** Verify alignment with project schedule (durations, milestones, critical path); identify any schedule risks

**Responsible:** Construction Manager (coordination); Reviewers (technical review)

**Output:** Consolidated review comments and recommended revisions

**Verification:** Construction Manager addresses review comments and updates draft narrative; PM confirms major issues resolved before advancing to Step 6

**Note:** Internal review may be conducted as a review meeting (efficient for synchronous discussion) or as written comments (asynchronous review for distributed teams). Coordinate timing with Proposal Manager to ensure adequate time for revisions before Step 6.

---

### Step 6: Compliance and Credibility Review

**Action:**
Circulate revised draft narrative to Proposal Manager and Senior Reviewer for compliance and credibility assessment:

1. **Proposal Manager Review (Compliance Focus):**
   - Verify narrative addresses all RFP Section 7.2 headings and content requirements (Specification R-01)
   - Verify narrative format and length are appropriate for proposal assembly (check if RFP specifies page limits)
   - Verify narrative uses required headings and order per RFP structure (decomposition document Constraint C-02)
   - Identify any compliance gaps or risks

2. **Senior Reviewer Review (Credibility Focus):**
   - Evaluate narrative for clarity, specificity, and persuasiveness (Specification R-11: Feasibility and Risk Control Demonstration)
   - Evaluate narrative for evaluator perspective: Does it inspire confidence? Is it credible and realistic?
   - Identify any areas that appear generic, overpromising, or insufficiently detailed
   - Recommend improvements for maximizing evaluation score

**Conformance Verification Gate:** *(Source: Lensing Item D-003)*
Proposal Manager uses RFP Section 7.2 Compliance Checklist (created in Step 0 Pre-verification):
- For each RFP Section 7.2 requirement/heading, verify narrative includes substantive content (not placeholder or TBD)
- If all items checked, narrative PASSES conformance gate and may proceed to Step 7
- If any item fails, narrative must be revised until all items pass
- Document checklist completion as gate evidence
- **Conformance gate failure blocks proposal assembly**

**Audit Trail Documentation:** Document compliance decisions made during review: what was checked, by whom, approval authority, date. This creates post-award traceability for RFP Section 7.2 compliance verification. *(Source: Lensing Item A-006)*

**Responsible:** Proposal Manager, Senior Reviewer (review); Construction Manager (revisions)

**Output:** Compliance checklist (pass/fail on RFP requirements); credibility assessment and improvement recommendations

**Verification:** Construction Manager addresses compliance gaps (if any) and incorporates credibility improvements; PM confirms compliance and readiness for finalization

---

### Step 7: Finalize Narrative and Update Status

**Action:**
1. Incorporate final revisions from Step 6
2. Conduct final self-review against Specification requirements (R-01 through R-11) and acceptance criteria from `_CONTEXT.md` ("Addresses Section 7.2 headings; demonstrates feasibility and risk control")
3. Export narrative in format required for proposal assembly (PDF, Word, or as directed by Proposal Manager)
4. Deliver finalized narrative to Proposal Manager for inclusion in final proposal package
5. Update `_STATUS.md` to reflect deliverable completion:
   - If current status is `INITIALIZED`, update to `COMPLETED` (or appropriate next state per project lifecycle)
   - Append history entry: `[YYYY-MM-DD] — Deliverable finalized and delivered to Proposal Manager for proposal assembly`

**Responsible:** Construction Manager (finalization); Proposal Manager (receipt and assembly coordination)

**Output:** Finalized Construction Methodology Narrative ready for proposal assembly; updated `_STATUS.md`

**Verification:** Proposal Manager confirms receipt and compatibility with proposal assembly process; verifies narrative is included in final proposal PDF

---

### Step 7b: Quality Oversight During Assembly *(Source: Lensing Item D-006)*

**Action:**
After narrative is delivered to Proposal Manager, Proposal Manager / Senior Reviewer conducts spot-check during proposal assembly:

1. Verify narrative content integrity (no formatting loss, citations intact during PDF assembly)
2. Verify cross-references to other proposal sections are accurate (e.g., cross-ref to schedule, pricing, design, team)
3. Conduct final evaluator-perspective read-through day before submission (Is narrative clear? Is it persuasive? Does it inspire confidence?)
4. Document spot-check results and flag any last-minute issues for resolution

**Responsible:** Proposal Manager, Senior Reviewer

**Output:** Quality spot-check documentation; last-minute issue flags (if any)

**Verification:** Continuous oversight ensures narrative quality through final submission

---

### Step 8: Post-Submission Monitoring *(Source: Lensing Item X-004)*

**Action:**
If proposal is revised post-submission (e.g., to respond to evaluator questions, clarify scope, update pricing), Proposal Manager notifies Construction Manager of changes. Construction Manager reviews revision for coherence with construction methodology narrative:

1. Does schedule change require methodology revision?
2. Do pricing/scope changes affect feasibility claims in narrative?
3. Do design changes affect construction approach described in narrative?
4. Are consistency issues identified and corrected?

**Responsible:** Proposal Manager (notification); Construction Manager (coherence review)

**Output:** Monitoring review documentation; revisions required (if any)

**Verification:** Document monitoring review and any revisions required; ensures narrative coherence through proposal lifecycle

- [ ] Narrative aligns with project schedule from DEL-08-01 (Specification R-10)
- [ ] Narrative addresses site constraints from DEL-09-02 or site reference documents (Specification R-08)
- [ ] Narrative is consistent with pricing assumptions from DEL-05-03 (Specification R-07: utilities allowance approach if applicable)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Narrative is specific and project-tailored (not generic boilerplate; Guidance Principle 5)
- [ ] Narrative is feasible and realistic (accounts for site constraints and schedule; Guidance Principle 1)
- [ ] Narrative is risk-aware and transparent (acknowledges and mitigates key risks; Guidance Principle 2)
- [ ] Narrative integrates with design and schedule (demonstrates buildability and feasibility; Guidance Principle 3)
- [ ] Narrative emphasizes safety as core value (comprehensive and site-specific; Guidance Principle 4)
- [ ] Narrative is clear, credible, and persuasive (maximizes evaluation score; Specification R-11)
- [ ] All TBD items are resolved or flagged for human decision
- [ ] Sources are cited for non-trivial statements; assumptions are labeled

**Holistic Assessment (Gestalt Quality):** *(Source: Lensing Item X-003)*
- [ ] Does narrative demonstrate deep site understanding (not generic)?
- [ ] Does narrative flow logically from site context -> constraints -> phasing -> logistics -> safety -> admin coordination?
- [ ] Are key challenges identified and addressed (schedule compression, site constraints, safety risks, coordination complexity)?
- [ ] Would post-award construction team have adequate baseline framework to begin detailed planning?
- [ ] Would evaluators view this as work of experienced team (not first-time builders)?

If any holistic assessment question is "no," consider whether narrative requires substantial revision for quality improvement.
