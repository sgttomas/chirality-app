**Source:** RFP §4.2–4.3; Decomposition §3 Constraint C-01.

**Rationale:** Ensures evaluator accessibility and compliance with Town's submission processing systems.

**Verification:** File properties check (format = PDF; size < 15 MB).

---

### R-02: Heading Order and Structure

**Requirement:** The proposal must use the main headings from RFP Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9, and present information in that order to ensure full consideration.

**Source:** RFP §4.2–4.3; Decomposition §3 Constraint C-02.

**Rationale:** Facilitates evaluator navigation and ensures all content is found in expected locations during scoring.

**Verification:** Table of contents or heading structure review against RFP Sections 6–9.

### Compliance Thresholds (Pass/Fail Criteria)

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING A-003 (Matrix A, Lens: A:normative:judging)

**Issue:** Decomposition §6 Objective OBJ-001 states "pass all mandatory requirements" but does not define the threshold for pass vs. fail. This section establishes explicit compliance thresholds.

**Pass Criteria:** A submission passes compliance if ALL of the following are met:
1. **Format Compliance:** PDF format; file size < 15 MB (R-01)
2. **Structure Compliance:** Content follows RFP Sections 6–9 heading order (R-02)
3. **Execution Compliance:** All required signatures and seals present based on proponent legal form (R-03)
4. **Timing Compliance:** Submitted via email before Aug 30, 2024 @ 2:00 PM MST (R-04)
5. **Addenda Compliance:** All three addenda acknowledged (R-07)
6. **Content Compliance:** All mandatory items from DEL-01-01 compliance matrix present (R-08)

**Fail Criteria:** A submission fails compliance (and is disqualified from scoring) if ANY of the following:
- PDF exceeds 15 MB and cannot be opened/processed by Town systems
- Submitted after deadline (even by 1 minute)
- Missing required signatures or seals
- Failure to acknowledge addenda in Appendix H
- Missing any mandatory content item flagged in DEL-01-01

**Decision Authority:** Town of Penhold Procurement evaluators determine compliance per RFP evaluation criteria.

**ASSUMPTION:** Pass/fail is binary — there is no partial compliance credit. Confirm with RFP or Town Procurement whether cure periods exist for minor compliance deficiencies.

---

### Legal Form Decision Tree (Execution Requirements)

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING C-001 (Matrix C, Lens: C:normative:necessity); Specification R-03; RFP §5.2 (not accessible)

**Issue:** Specification requires execution "based on proponent legal form" but does not specify which legal forms require which signatures/seals.

**Decision Tree:**

| Proponent Legal Form | Signature Requirements | Seal Requirements | Reference |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Sole Proprietor** | Proprietor signature | Personal seal (if required by RFP §5.2) | **TBD** — Verify against RFP §5.2 |
| **Partnership** | All partner signatures OR authorized partner with partnership resolution | Partnership seal (if applicable) | **TBD** — Verify against RFP §5.2 |
| **Corporation** | Authorized signing officer(s) per corporate bylaws | Corporate seal (if required) | **TBD** — Verify against RFP §5.2 |
| **Joint Venture** | All JV party signatures OR lead party with JV agreement | As per JV structure | **TBD** — Verify against RFP §5.2 |

**Documents Requiring Execution:**
1. Cover page (signature page) — All entity types
2. Letter of Offer (Appendix G) — All entity types
3. Appendix H (Financial Proposal) — All entity types (signature + addenda acknowledgement)
4. Bonding evidence (if includes certification) — As specified by surety

**ASSUMPTION:** All executed copies must bear original signatures (wet ink or compliant electronic signature per RFP). Confirm with RFP §5.2 whether electronic signatures are accepted.

**Action Required:** Before content freeze, Proposal Manager must confirm proponent legal form and verify specific requirements against RFP §5.2.

---

### Mandatory Content Checklist (R-08 Support)

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING F-001 (Matrix F, Lens: F:normative:necessity)

**Issue:** R-08 requires "all mandatory proposal content" but does not enumerate the specific items. This checklist provides an inline reference; definitive source is DEL-01-01.

**Mandatory Content Items:** (Cross-reference to DEL-01-01 for authoritative list)

| Category | Mandatory Items | DEL-01-01 Reference |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Compliance Documents** | Letter of Offer (Appendix G), Compliance Matrix, Bonding Evidence | DEL-01-01 §Compliance |
| **Financial Proposal** | Appendix H Schedule A (Pricing Summary), Appendix H Schedule B (Cost Breakdown) | DEL-01-01 §Financial |
| **Technical Proposal** | Concept Design, Design Brief, Methodology, Schedule | DEL-01-01 §Technical |
| **Team Qualifications** | Appendix I (Subtrade/Consultant List), Key Personnel Resumes | DEL-01-01 §Team |
| **Addenda Acknowledgement** | Acknowledgement of Addenda 01, 02, 03 in Appendix H | DEL-01-01 §Addenda |

**Verification:** Use DEL-01-01 compliance matrix as the definitive checklist during Step 6 (Verify Compliance Requirements).

**Note:** DEL-01-02 relies on DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix and Checklist) as its source of truth for mandatory content definitions. DEL-01-01 is used internally by Proposal Manager during assembly and QA but is not necessarily included in the final submitted PDF unless RFP specifically requires it. Confirm with Proposal Manager whether RFP mandates compliance matrix inclusion in submission. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING X-003)

---

### Revision Numbering Convention (R-05 Standard)

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING F-004 (Matrix F, Lens: F:evaluative:consistency)

**Issue:** Specification states revision "must be clearly indicated" but does not standardize the convention, risking inconsistent labeling across submissions.

**Standard Convention:**

| Submission Type | Cover Page Label | File Name Suffix | Email Subject Suffix |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Initial submission** | ORIGINAL SUBMISSION | _Original | — ORIGINAL |
| **First revision** | REVISION 1 — Supersedes [original submission time] | _Rev1 | — REVISION 1 |
| **Second revision** | REVISION 2 — Supersedes REVISION 1 | _Rev2 | — REVISION 2 |
| **Subsequent revisions** | REVISION [N] — Supersedes REVISION [N-1] | _Rev[N] | — REVISION [N] |

**Example File Names:**
- `ABC_Builders_Penhold_PSB_RFP2024_004_Original.pdf`
- `ABC_Builders_Penhold_PSB_RFP2024_004_Rev1.pdf`

**ASSUMPTION:** RFP §4.2–4.3 does not mandate a specific convention; proponent may use this standard. If RFP specifies a different convention, defer to RFP. (Confirm with RFP or Proposal Manager.)

---

### RFP Section 6–9 Heading Structure

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING A-001 (Matrix A, Lens: A:normative:guiding)

**Issue:** Constraint C-02 requires proposal to use RFP Sections 6–9 headings in order, but exact heading text is not accessible.

**ASSUMPTION:** RFP Sections 6–9 provide the mandatory heading structure. The following is a placeholder mapping pending RFP access:

| RFP Section | Assumed Content Area | Mapped Deliverables |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Section 6** | Mandatory Compliance / Submission Requirements | DEL-01-01, DEL-01-02 (Letter of Offer), DEL-01-03 |
| **Section 7** | Technical Proposal | DEL-02, DEL-03, DEL-04, DEL-06, DEL-08, DEL-09 |
| **Section 8** | Financial Proposal | DEL-05-01, DEL-05-02, DEL-05-03 |
| **Section 9** | Team Qualifications | DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-07-03 |

**Action Required:** Before Step 3 (Verify RFP Structure and Heading Order), Proposal Manager must obtain RFP Sections 6–9 and extract exact heading text. Update Procedure Step 3 and Specification R-02 with actual headings once available.

## Assumptions and Clarifications

### Key Assumptions

1. **RFP Section 4.2–4.3 detail:** Specific email address, subject line format, and submission confirmation process are detailed in RFP §4.2–4.3 but were not accessible during document generation (**location TBD**).

2. **RFP Sections 6–9 heading structure:** Exact heading text and sequence for proposal organization are specified in RFP §6–9 but were not accessible (**location TBD**).

3. **Appendix G format:** Letter of Offer template structure and completion instructions are provided in Appendix G but were not accessible (**location TBD**).

4. **Appendix H addenda acknowledgement:** Specific format for acknowledging addenda (checkbox, signature, statement) is defined in Appendix H but was not accessible (**location TBD**).

5. **Execution requirements by entity type:** Signature and seal requirements vary by proponent legal form (sole proprietor, partnership, corporation) and are detailed in RFP §5.2 (**location TBD**).

6. **Revision numbering convention:** RFP may specify a preferred revision numbering system; if not, proponent determines convention (**location TBD**).

### Clarifications Needed (TBD)

- **Email submission address:** Confirm recipient email address(es) from RFP §4.2–4.3
- **Subject line format:** Confirm required or recommended subject line format
- **File naming convention:** Confirm if RFP specifies file name format (e.g., "Proponent_Name_RFP_2024_004_Rev1.pdf")
- **Submission confirmation:** Confirm if Town provides automatic or manual submission receipt confirmation
- **Multiple revisions handling:** Confirm if there is a limit on number of revisions allowed before deadline

**Source:** Inferred requirements based on decomposition constraints; full RFP text required to resolve TBD items.

### TBD Resolution Plan

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING E-004 (Matrix E, Lens: E:evaluative:consistency)

**Issue:** Specification lists assumptions and clarifications needed but does not establish a process for resolving them before final assembly.

**Resolution Process:**

| TBD Item | Resolution Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|----------|-------------------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Email submission address** | Consult RFP §4.2–4.3 or contact Town Procurement | Proposal Manager | Content freeze - 7 days | TBD |
| **RFP Sections 6–9 headings** | Extract from RFP or request clarification from Town | Proposal Manager | Content freeze - 7 days | TBD |
| **Execution form requirements** | Confirm proponent legal entity type and required seals per RFP §5.2 | Proposal Manager + Legal | Content freeze - 7 days | TBD |
| **Revision numbering convention** | Confirm RFP requirement or establish proponent standard | Proposal Manager | Content freeze - 7 days | TBD |
| **Subject line format** | Check RFP for specified format; if none, use standard convention | Proposal Manager | Content freeze - 3 days | TBD |

**Resolution Deadline:** All TBD items must be resolved at least 7 days before content freeze to allow procedure planning and team communication.

**Escalation:** If Town Procurement does not respond to clarification requests within 48 hours, escalate to senior leadership for alternative resolution approach.

**Documentation:** Record all TBD resolutions in project log with date, source, and decision made.
