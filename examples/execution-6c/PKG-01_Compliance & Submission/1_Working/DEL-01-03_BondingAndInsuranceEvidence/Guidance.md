# Guidance: DEL-01-03 Bonding and Insurance Evidence

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to satisfy a **mandatory compliance requirement** for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal (RFP 2024_004). The Agreement to Bond demonstrates to the Town of Penhold that the proponent has secured surety capacity and is financially committed to delivering the project if the proposal is accepted.

**Why this matters:**

1. **Risk mitigation for the Owner:** Bonding protects the Town against contractor default, incomplete work, or unpaid subcontractors/suppliers.
2. **Proponent credibility:** Demonstrates financial strength and surety relationships.
3. **Mandatory gate:** Failure to include compliant bonding evidence may result in proposal disqualification (identified as a high compliance risk in the decomposition).

**Scoring vs. Pass/Fail:** **TBD** — Determine whether bonding evidence is evaluated/scored or merely a compliance gate. If scored, guidance should address how to maximize credibility impact beyond minimum compliance. If pass/fail only, focus on compliance completeness. This distinction affects optimal effort allocation. — *[E-005]*

## Principles

### Principle 1: Proposal-Stage Commitment vs. Final Bond Issuance

**At the proposal stage**, the proponent provides an **Agreement to Bond** — a commitment from a surety company (or broker) confirming willingness and capacity to issue bonds if the proposal is accepted. This is **not** the final bond itself.

**Rationale:**
- Sureties cannot issue final bonds until a contract is awarded and contract value is finalized.
- The Agreement to Bond serves as evidence of prequalification and surety relationship strength.
- Final bonds (performance bond, labor and material payment bond) are typically issued post-award, prior to contract execution.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** (standard industry practice for Design-Build RFPs; specific RFP requirements **TBD** from RFP §5.3.1)

---

### Principle 2: Bond Costs Are Part of Project Costs

**Bond costs must be included in the proposal pricing.** Bonding is not "free" — sureties charge a premium (typically a percentage of contract value) based on project risk, proponent financial strength, and bond type.

**Rationale:**
- Excluding bond costs from pricing creates a pricing gap that undermines competitiveness or leads to post-award disputes.
- RFP §5.3.1 requires bond cost inclusion (per decomposition scope ledger, line 314).
- Transparency in bond cost allocation supports pricing credibility (OBJ-007).

**Typical bond cost drivers:**
- Contract value (larger contracts = higher absolute cost, but potentially lower percentage rate)
- Proponent financial track record and surety relationship
- Project complexity and perceived risk
- Bond percentage typically ranges from 1-3% of contract value for construction projects

**Source:** Decomposition document (SOW-004, line 277; scope ledger notes, line 314); **ASSUMPTION** (percentage range based on industry norms; specific rate **TBD** from surety quote)

---

### Principle 3: Surety Licensing and Jurisdictional Compliance

**The surety company must be licensed to operate in Alberta.** Using an unlicensed or out-of-jurisdiction surety may render the bond unenforceable.

**Rationale:**
- Alberta public sector contracts typically require surety prequalification with provincial regulatory authorities.
- Owner needs assurance that the surety can be held accountable under Alberta law.

**Foundational Understanding of Alberta Surety Regulation:** — *[B-008]*
- **What makes a surety "licensed":** A surety must be registered with the applicable Alberta regulatory authority to issue bonds in the province. The specific authority is **TBD** (Specification references "Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Alberta" but name requires verification per C-004).
- **Regulatory oversight:** Licensed sureties are subject to provincial financial oversight, capital requirements, and claims handling standards.
- **Consequences of surety default:** If a surety fails to honor a bond claim, the claimant may pursue remedies through provincial regulatory processes and civil litigation under Alberta law.
- **Note:** This foundational knowledge equips teams unfamiliar with surety processes to navigate the domain competently.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** (standard for Alberta municipal projects; requires confirmation from RFP §5.3.1 **location TBD**)

---

### Principle 4: Cross-Document Consistency Is Non-Negotiable

**Bond costs stated in this deliverable must reconcile with bond costs in Appendix H (Schedule A and Schedule B).** Inconsistent figures across documents signal poor quality control and may raise evaluator concerns about pricing accuracy.

**Rationale:**
- Proposal evaluation teams check for internal consistency as a proxy for proponent diligence.
- Discrepancies may trigger clarification requests, score penalties, or disqualification.
- Cross-document consistency is a fundamental requirement of the agent protocol (SPEC section, cross-document consistency requirement).

## Considerations

### For the Proposal Manager

1. **Timing:** Obtain Agreement to Bond early (surety processing may take 1-2 weeks). Coordinate with surety/broker well before proposal deadline.

2. **Surety prequalification:** Confirm that the surety is licensed in Alberta and has capacity for the anticipated contract value. If using a new surety relationship, allow extra time for underwriting.

3. **Format and content verification:** Review Agreement to Bond against RFP §5.3.1 requirements (when accessible). Common required elements:
   - Surety company name, contact, and licensing information
   - Project identification (RFP number, project name, Owner name)
   - Bond types (performance bond, labor and material payment bond)
   - Contract value capacity or stated commitment
   - Validity period (must cover proposal evaluation period)
   - Authorized signature and surety seal

   **Merit Demonstration Beyond Minimum Compliance:** — *[A-007]*
   - Consider naming a well-known, highly-rated surety to convey financial strength
   - Include specific bonding capacity figures (not just "sufficient") to demonstrate headroom
   - Provide validity period extending beyond minimum required to show commitment
   - If surety has A.M. Best rating of A or higher, consider including this in the letter
   - **Note:** These enhancements may differentiate the proposal if bonding evidence is evaluated rather than merely pass/fail

4. **Insurance coordination:** If RFP §5.3.1 requires an insurance approach summary at proposal stage, coordinate with insurance broker to obtain coverage confirmation or statement of approach. Typical insurance types for Design-Build projects:
   - Commercial general liability (CGL)
   - Professional liability (errors and omissions)
   - Builder's risk (course of construction insurance)
   - Workers' compensation
   - **Note:** Specific insurance requirements are **TBD** (RFP §5.3.1 **location TBD**).

### For the Estimator / Commercial Lead

1. **Bond cost estimation:** Work with surety/broker to obtain bond cost estimate (percentage or fixed fee). Incorporate into Appendix H Schedule B under general requirements or a dedicated bond cost line.

2. **Additional Options bonding:** Determine whether Additional Options 1-6 (Appendix H) are bonded separately or as part of the base contract bond. This may affect bond cost allocation. **ASSUMPTION:** Needs clarification from surety and RFP terms.

3. **Pricing narrative alignment:** If producing a pricing narrative (DEL-05-03), ensure bond cost treatment is explained consistently with this deliverable's bond cost inclusion statement.

### For the Team

1. **Compliance checklist integration:** Ensure Agreement to Bond is listed on the compliance matrix (DEL-01-01) as a mandatory item.

2. **Final PDF assembly:** Confirm Agreement to Bond is included in the formal submission package (DEL-01-02) in the correct location (typically in a compliance or formal documents section).

3. **Addenda acknowledgment:** The decomposition notes that Appendix H includes an addenda acknowledgment line; failure to acknowledge addenda may disqualify the price proposal (decomposition hard constraints, line 49). Ensure addenda integration is complete before finalizing bond cost figures.

4. **Failure Scenario Awareness:** — *[B-007]*
   - **If Agreement to Bond is deficient or rejected:** Check RFP for clarification/cure period provisions. Some RFPs allow minor deficiencies to be corrected during a clarification period; others treat bonding deficiencies as automatic disqualification.
   - **If surety refuses to issue letter:** Escalate immediately to Commercial Lead; may need to engage alternative surety relationship on expedited basis.
   - **If bond costs cannot be reconciled:** Resolve with Estimator before submission; unresolved discrepancies indicate quality control failure.
   - **Note:** The high-risk compliance flag makes failure scenario preparation critical.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Surety Relationship vs. Cost Competitiveness

**Tension:** Using an established surety relationship may expedite Agreement to Bond issuance but could result in higher bond costs. Shopping for competitive surety rates may reduce costs but introduces delay and relationship risk.

**Considerations:**
- Established relationships typically offer faster turnaround and higher confidence in bond issuance.
- Competitive surety shopping may yield lower rates (0.5-1% difference can be significant on a multi-million dollar project).
- Proposal deadline pressure may limit time for surety shopping.

**Guidance:** If time permits, obtain quotes from 2-3 sureties. If deadline is tight, prioritize reliability and speed over marginal cost savings.

**Defensibility of Bond Cost Estimate:** — *[F-006]*
- If Owner challenges the bond cost rate, the proponent should be able to justify it with evidence.
- **Defensible evidence sources (in order of strength):**
  1. Actual surety quote for this project
  2. Recent surety quote for comparable project (same proponent, similar value/risk)
  3. Industry benchmark data (e.g., published surety rate surveys)
  4. Historical rate from proponent's past projects
- **Weakest:** Proponent self-statement without supporting documentation
- **Recommendation:** Obtain and retain surety quote even if not required to submit with proposal; provides defense if questioned during evaluation or negotiation.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** (derived from proposal management best practices)

### Trade-off 2: Proposal-Stage Insurance Detail vs. Simplicity

**Tension:** Providing detailed insurance coverage information at proposal stage demonstrates preparedness but may create exposure if coverage details change post-award. Providing a high-level insurance approach summary maintains flexibility but may be perceived as less thorough.

**Considerations:**
- RFP may specify the level of insurance detail required at proposal stage (**TBD** from RFP §5.3.1).
- Overly detailed insurance commitments at proposal stage may lock the proponent into specific coverage terms that become problematic during contract negotiation.
- Minimal insurance disclosure may satisfy compliance but could reduce proposal competitiveness if other proponents provide more detail.

**Guidance:** If RFP §5.3.1 specifies insurance detail requirements, meet them precisely. If vague or silent, provide a brief insurance approach summary (1-2 paragraphs) that demonstrates awareness and capability without overcommitting to specific terms.

**Prudential Threshold Criteria:** — *[B-009]*
- **Cross from prudent to overcommitting when:**
  - Specifying exact policy numbers or carrier names that may change
  - Committing to coverage amounts higher than RFP requires without clear benefit
  - Providing detailed coverage terms that may conflict with contract negotiation positions
- **Stay in prudent zone by:**
  - Stating coverage types and minimum amounts matching or slightly exceeding RFP requirements
  - Using language like "will provide" or "will obtain" rather than "currently have"
  - Referencing "contract requirements" as the governing standard for final coverage

## Notes

- **Missing RFP Details:** RFP §5.3.1 was not accessible (PDF read failed). Bond percentages, specific bond types, insurance requirements, and format specifications are marked **TBD** throughout this document. When RFP becomes accessible, update Datasheet, Specification, and this Guidance document accordingly.
- **Assumptions Flagged:** Multiple assumptions made based on standard Alberta Design-Build RFP practice (surety licensing, bond types, insurance types, bond cost percentage ranges). All assumptions require verification against RFP §5.3.1.
- **Cross-Document Consistency Alert:** Bond cost figures must reconcile with DEL-05-02 (Appendix H Schedule B). Any changes to bond costs during pricing development must be propagated to this deliverable.
