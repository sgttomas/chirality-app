# Procedure: DEL-01-03 Bonding and Insurance Evidence

## Purpose

This procedure describes how to **produce** the Bonding and Insurance Evidence deliverable (DEL-01-03) for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal. The deliverable consists of three components: Agreement to Bond, Bond Cost Inclusion Statement, and Insurance Approach Summary (if required).

**Completion of this procedure results in:**
- Compliant Agreement to Bond obtained from surety and ready for inclusion in proposal
- Bond cost inclusion statement prepared and reconciled with pricing documents
- Insurance approach summary prepared (if required by RFP)
- All three components verified against RFP §5.3.1 requirements and ready for integration into formal submission package (DEL-01-02)

**Source:** `_CONTEXT.md` (anticipated artifacts); decomposition document (DEL-01-03 acceptance criteria, line 174)

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

**Mode:** NOT_TRACKED — Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).

**Typical upstream dependencies** (to be coordinated by Proposal Manager):
- Pricing development progress (DEL-05-01/02) — Bond costs must be estimated and included in Appendix H
- Surety relationship established or broker engaged
- RFP §5.3.1 requirements fully understood (currently **TBD** — PDF access issue)

**Source:** `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (lines 4-5); **ASSUMPTION** (typical proposal workflow)

### Readiness Checklist — *[C-005]*

Before starting this procedure, confirm the following actionable readiness conditions:

- [ ] Surety relationship is active OR surety broker is engaged and ready to proceed
- [ ] Estimator has preliminary contract value range for surety capacity confirmation
- [ ] RFP §5.3.1 has been read and requirements extracted (or flagged as TBD with mitigation plan)
- [ ] Proposal deadline is known and timeline allows for 1-2 week surety processing
- [ ] Team has foundational understanding of bonding/insurance domain (see Guidance Principle 3 for foundational knowledge) — *[X-001]*

**Start-No-Later-Than Milestone:** — *[E-004]*
- **Calculation:** Proposal deadline minus 2 weeks (for established surety relationship) or minus 3 weeks (for new surety relationship)
- **Example:** If proposal due February 28, start Step 2 no later than February 14 (established) or February 7 (new relationship)
- **Rationale:** Guidance mentions 1-2 weeks for surety processing; this enforces timeline as a procedural constraint rather than advisory note

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify RFP Requirements

**Objective:** Understand the specific requirements for Agreement to Bond, bond cost inclusion, and insurance evidence from RFP §5.3.1.

**Actions:**
1. Read RFP §5.3.1 in full (currently **TBD** — PDF not accessible).
2. Extract and document:
   - Required bond types (e.g., performance bond, labor and material payment bond)
   - Bond amounts or percentages (e.g., 50% performance bond, 50% labor and material payment bond)
   - Agreement to Bond format requirements (letter content, surety information, validity period)
   - Insurance requirements at proposal stage (types, coverage minimums, certificate requirements)
   - Any specific format or template requirements
3. Update `Specification.md` with extracted requirements, replacing **TBD** placeholders.

**Verification:** RFP requirements documented; no ambiguities remain. If ambiguities exist, flag for clarification request to Owner or document as assumption.

**Obligation Completeness Check:** — *[A-005]*
- Create or update an obligation register/checklist that lists every bonding/insurance obligation from RFP §5.3.1
- Verify each obligation is mapped to a specific requirement in Specification.md
- Confirm no obligations are missed (systematic check, not just extraction)
- Document completeness confirmation with date and reviewer initials

### Step 3: Obtain Bond Cost Estimate and Prepare Bond Cost Inclusion Statement

**Objective:** Determine bond cost and confirm inclusion in Appendix H pricing; prepare bond cost inclusion statement.

**Actions:**
1. **Obtain bond cost estimate from surety or broker:**
   - Request bond cost quote (percentage of contract value or fixed fee).
   - Typical range: 1-3% of contract value; actual rate depends on project risk, proponent financials, and surety underwriting.
   - Confirm whether bond cost applies to base contract only or includes Additional Options 1-6 (Appendix H).

2. **Coordinate with Estimator / Commercial Lead:**
   - Provide bond cost estimate to Estimator for inclusion in Appendix H Schedule B (DEL-05-02).
   - Verify bond cost is allocated correctly (typically under General Requirements or dedicated Bonds and Insurance line item).
   - Confirm bond cost is rolled up into Schedule A total (DEL-05-01).

3. **Draft Bond Cost Inclusion Statement:**
   - Prepare statement (standalone or for integration into DEL-05-03 pricing narrative).
   - Include:
     - Bond cost percentage or dollar amount
     - Basis for cost (surety quote, industry rate)
     - Confirmation that cost is included in Appendix H
     - Reference to Schedule B line item (e.g., "Line XX — Bonds and Insurance")
   - Example format provided in `Guidance.md` (Example 2).

4. **Cross-Document Reconciliation:**
   - Verify bond cost figure in this deliverable matches bond cost in DEL-05-02 (Schedule B).
   - If discrepancy exists, resolve immediately (update estimate or pricing document).

**Verification:** Bond cost estimate obtained; inclusion statement prepared; figures reconcile with Appendix H.

**Responsible Party:** Estimator / Commercial Lead (bond cost estimate and pricing integration); Proposal Manager (statement preparation and reconciliation)

### Step 4: Prepare Insurance Approach Summary (If Required)

**Objective:** Prepare insurance approach summary if required by RFP §5.3.1 at proposal stage.

**Actions:**
1. **Verify RFP requirement:**
   - Check RFP §5.3.1 (from Step 1) for insurance evidence requirements at proposal stage.
   - If insurance summary is required, proceed with sub-steps 2-4 below.
   - If not required, proceed to Step 5. — *[C-007]*

2. **Engage insurance broker:**
   - Contact insurance broker to confirm coverage capacity and approach for the project.
   - Request confirmation or statement of approach for required insurance types (e.g., CGL, professional liability, builder's risk, workers' compensation).

3. **Draft Insurance Approach Summary:**
   - Prepare brief narrative (1-2 paragraphs) summarizing insurance coverage approach.
   - Include:
     - Insurance types to be provided
     - Coverage minimums (if specified by RFP or standard for similar projects)
     - Timing of certificate issuance (e.g., upon contract award, prior to construction commencement)
     - Broker name and confirmation of capacity
   - Example format provided in `Guidance.md` (Example 3).
   - **Avoid overcommitting:** Keep summary high-level to maintain flexibility during contract negotiation (see Guidance Trade-off 2).

4. **QC Check:**
   - Review summary against RFP §5.3.1 insurance requirements (from Step 1).
   - Ensure no conflicting statements or unintended commitments.

**Verification:** Insurance approach summary prepared (if required); summary meets RFP requirements without overcommitting.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (coordination and drafting); insurance broker (capacity confirmation)

### Step 5: Assemble Deliverable Package

**Objective:** Assemble all three components into a cohesive deliverable ready for integration into the formal submission package (DEL-01-02).

**Actions:**
1. **Compile components:**
   - Agreement to Bond (letter from surety/broker)
   - Bond Cost Inclusion Statement (standalone or integrated into pricing narrative)
   - Insurance Approach Summary (if required)

2. **Format for proposal submission:**
   - **Option A:** Create a standalone document titled "Bonding and Insurance Evidence" that includes all three components.
   - **Option B:** Include Agreement to Bond as a standalone appendix; integrate bond cost inclusion statement and insurance summary into other narrative sections (e.g., pricing narrative or compliance section).
   - **Decision point:** Coordinate with Proposal Manager to determine format based on RFP structure and proposal organization preferences.

3. **Cross-reference with compliance matrix (DEL-01-01):**
   - Ensure this deliverable is listed on the compliance matrix as a mandatory item.
   - Reference page number or section location in final proposal PDF.

4. **Cross-reference with formal submission package (DEL-01-02):**
   - Coordinate with Proposal Manager to confirm this deliverable is included in the final PDF assembly plan.
   - Verify inclusion in correct location (typically in compliance or formal documents section).

**Verification:** All components assembled; format decided; cross-references established with DEL-01-01 and DEL-01-02.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager

**Source:** Decomposition document (deliverable definitions and interfaces); Specification REQ-07 (consistency requirement)

### Revalidation Triggers — *[X-007]*

If any of the following upstream conditions change after Steps 3-5 completion, revalidate the affected deliverable components:

| Trigger Condition | Revalidation Actions |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Contract value estimate changes significantly (>10%)** | Re-confirm surety capacity; update bond cost estimate; verify Agreement to Bond capacity statement remains valid |
| **Surety withdraws or modifies capacity** | Obtain new/updated Agreement to Bond; update bond cost if rate changes |
| **RFP addendum changes bonding/insurance requirements** | Re-extract requirements (Step 1); update all affected components |
| **Insurance requirements change** | Update Insurance Approach Summary; verify no overcommitment issues |

**Note:** This procedure is not single-pass. Changes to inputs require revalidation to maintain compliance.

### Post-Submission Monitoring — *[D-005]*

**Risk:** If surety withdraws capacity or bond cost changes after submission but before award, the proposal may become non-compliant or financially untenable.

**Monitoring Actions:**
1. Maintain communication with surety through proposal evaluation period
2. Alert surety immediately if any conditions change (e.g., scope changes from addenda)
3. If surety issues any modifications to Agreement to Bond after submission, assess impact and determine if Owner notification is required
4. Document any post-submission communications related to bonding/insurance

**Authority:** Proposal Manager to determine notification requirements based on RFP clarification provisions

## Notes

- **Missing RFP Details:** Steps 1 and 4 require access to RFP §5.3.1, which is currently **TBD** (PDF access issue). Once RFP is accessible, update this procedure with specific format requirements, bond percentages, insurance types, and other details.
- **Coordination Critical:** This deliverable has hard dependencies on pricing development (DEL-05-01/02) and formal submission planning (DEL-01-02). Early coordination with Estimator and Proposal Manager is essential to avoid last-minute discrepancies or delays.
- **Timeline Consideration:** Agreement to Bond issuance may take 1-2 weeks (longer if establishing new surety relationship). Start Step 2 as early as possible to avoid proposal deadline risk.
- **High Compliance Risk:** This deliverable is flagged as a high compliance risk item (decomposition Section 11, line 348). Any deficiency or non-compliance may result in proposal disqualification. Prioritize accuracy and completeness over speed.
