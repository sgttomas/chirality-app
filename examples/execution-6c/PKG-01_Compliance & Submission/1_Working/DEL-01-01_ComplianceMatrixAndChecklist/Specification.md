# Specification: DEL-01-01 ComplianceMatrixAndChecklist

## Scope

### Included

This deliverable encompasses:

1. **Compliance Matrix** - A structured mapping of all RFP Sections 6-9 requirements to proposal response sections and page numbers, ensuring 100% coverage of mandatory and evaluated requirements.

2. **Addenda Integration Checklist** - A tracking document verifying that all changes and clarifications from Addendum 01, Addendum 02, and Addendum 03 have been properly integrated into the proposal content, pricing, design, and schedules.

3. **Pass/Fail Risk Register** - Identification of high-risk mandatory requirements with mitigation strategies and owner assignments.

**Compulsory Status:** This deliverable is COMPULSORY. A compliance matrix MUST be created and verified complete before proposal PDF assembly commences. *Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, ItemID C-001*

**Lifecycle Model (CONFLICT-02 Resolution):** The compliance matrix is a LIVING DOCUMENT, created initially and UPDATED throughout proposal development at defined milestones (50% draft, 90% draft, final review). Scope includes both creation AND maintenance. *Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, ItemID F-002, CONFLICT-02*

**Audience:** Compliance matrix is an INTERNAL PROPOSAL MANAGEMENT TOOL. It may optionally include a simplified summary in the submitted proposal at Proposal Manager discretion. *Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, ItemID C-006*

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (Description, Anticipated Artifacts); Decomposition Section 8, DEL-01-01 definition

### Excluded

This deliverable does NOT include:
- Content creation for other proposal deliverables (only maps/tracks them)
- Technical evaluation of proposal quality (only tracks requirement coverage)
- Final PDF assembly (covered by DEL-01-02)
- Actual submission execution (covered by DEL-01-02)

**ASSUMPTION:** Exclusions inferred from deliverable scope and package structure; DEL-01-01 is a tracking/verification tool, not a content creation or submission execution tool.

### Record Retention

**ASSUMPTION:** Compliance matrix and addenda checklist should be:
- Maintained as living documents during proposal development
- Included in proposal appendix or admin section for evaluator transparency **TBD** - confirm with proposal manager whether to include in submission or keep internal only
- Archived post-submission as part of proposal development record

**Rationale:** Demonstrates due diligence; provides audit trail; supports any post-submission clarification requests.

## Mandatory Verification Statement (E-001)

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION.** Before proposal PDF submission, Proposal Manager SHALL VERIFY and document:
1. 100% of RFP Section 6-9 requirements mapped
2. All HIGH risks flagged and mitigated
3. All addenda integrated and acknowledged

This verification is COMPULSORY, not optional. Failure to complete verification is grounds for delaying submission.
