#### 2.8 Hard Constraint Compliance Risks [A-003]
**Scope:** Mandatory pass/fail gates from Decomposition §3 Hard Constraints (C-01...C-07)

**Key Questions:**
- **C-01 (Format/Size):** What is the risk of proposal PDF exceeding 15 MB? (Risk if all drawings included at full resolution)
- **C-02 (Required Structure):** What is the risk of missing required section or incorrect order? (Risk if team unfamiliar with RFP structure requirements)
- **C-03 (Execution):** What is the risk of missing signature or seal? (Risk if execution requirements misunderstood)

- **Risk ID:** Sequential within category (e.g., DR-01, SR-01, CR-01...)
- **Category:** Design / Site / Cost / Schedule / Procurement / Environmental / Permitting
- **Description:** Clear, concise description of the risk (1-2 sentences)
- **Source:** Reference material or section that evidences the risk

**Verification:**
- All seven categories have at least one identified risk
- Each risk description is clear and specific (not generic)
- Each risk cites a source (RFP, addendum, reference report, or logical inference labeled ASSUMPTION)

**Source:** Specification.md Scope (7 risk categories); _REFERENCES.md (reference materials); Guidance.md Considerations (site and environmental factors, design and program factors, cost and pricing factors, schedule and procurement factors)

### Step 3: Assess Risk Probability and Impact

**Objective:** Quantify each risk using probability and impact scoring to enable prioritization

**Actions:**
1. For each identified risk, assign **Probability** score (1-5):
   - **1 = Very Low:** Risk is unlikely to occur (<10% chance)
   - **2 = Low:** Risk could occur but is not expected (10-25% chance)
   - **3 = Medium:** Risk has moderate likelihood (25-50% chance)
   - **4 = High:** Risk is likely to occur (50-75% chance)
   - **5 = Very High:** Risk is highly likely or certain (>75% chance)

2. For each identified risk, assign **Impact** score (1-5):
   - **1 = Negligible:** Minimal effect on cost (<1%), schedule (<1 week), or quality
   - **2 = Low:** Minor effect on cost (1-3%), schedule (1-2 weeks), or quality (minor rework)
   - **3 = Medium:** Moderate effect on cost (3-5%), schedule (2-4 weeks), or quality (significant rework)
   - **4 = High:** Major effect on cost (5-10%), schedule (4-8 weeks), or quality (major rework or non-compliance)
   - **5 = Critical:** Severe effect on cost (>10%), schedule (>8 weeks), quality (project failure or disqualification)

3. Calculate **Risk Score:** Probability × Impact (range 1-25)

4. Prioritize risks by score:
   - **Score 15-25 (High Priority):** Require detailed mitigation plans; executive review; close monitoring
   - **Score 8-14 (Medium Priority):** Require mitigation plans; regular monitoring
   - **Score 1-7 (Low Priority):** Monitor only; document but may not require active mitigation

4. **Document Scoring Rationale [F-002]:**
   - For each risk, document scoring rationale citing reference material(s) that support the P and I assignment
   - Example: "Probability=High (4) because Geotechnical Report (page XX) identifies variable groundwater requiring mitigation; Impact=Medium (3) assumes 5% foundation cost contingency typical for these conditions"
   - Scoring decisions must be substantiated with reference material evidence per Guidance Principle: Source Fidelity Over Speculation

**Verification:**
- All identified risks have Probability, Impact, and Score assigned
- Scoring rationale is documented (especially for high-score risks) with reference material citations
- High-priority risks (score ≥15) are flagged for detailed mitigation planning

**Source:** Datasheet.md Construction section (risk assessment framework); Guidance.md Principles (proportionality in risk assessment, source fidelity); ASSUMPTION — Probability/Impact scales based on ISO 31000 philosophy (standard text not accessible) [F-002 substantiation requirement]

### Step 4: Develop Mitigation Strategies

**Objective:** Create actionable mitigation plans for each identified risk

**Actions:**
For each identified risk (prioritize high-score risks first):

1. **Identify Mitigation Strategy Type:**
   - **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk by changing approach (e.g., change design to avoid wetland setback issue)
   - **Mitigate (Reduce Probability):** Take preventive actions to reduce likelihood (e.g., early permitting engagement)
   - **Mitigate (Reduce Impact):** Take actions to limit consequences if risk occurs (e.g., cost contingency, schedule buffer)
   - **Transfer:** Shift risk to another party (e.g., bonding, insurance, subtrade warranty)
   - **Accept:** Acknowledge risk and monitor; take no preventive action (typically for low-score risks only)

2. **Define Mitigation Actions:**
   - **Preventive Actions:** What will be done proactively to reduce probability? (e.g., "Base foundation design on conservative interpretation of Geotechnical Report; include geotechnical engineer review")
   - **Contingency Plans:** What will be done if risk materializes? (e.g., "Include 5% foundation cost contingency; plan for supplementary geotechnical investigation if conditions differ")
   - **Monitoring Approach:** How will risk status be tracked? (e.g., "Construction observation by geotechnical engineer during excavation")
   - **Trigger Points:** What conditions will activate contingency plan? (e.g., "If bearing capacity is <50 kPa as assumed, activate supplementary investigation")

3. **Assign Risk Owner:**
   - Each risk must have a designated owner responsible for monitoring and executing mitigation actions
   - Typical owners: PM, Design Lead, Construction Manager, Estimator, Scheduler, specific Technical Lead

4. **Set Initial Status:**
   - **Active:** Risk is current and requires monitoring/mitigation
   - **Mitigated:** Risk has been reduced to acceptable level (but still monitored)
   - **Closed:** Risk no longer applies (e.g., scope removed, issue resolved)

**Verification:**
- Every identified risk has a mitigation strategy (even if "Accept + Monitor" for low-score risks)
- High-priority risks (score ≥15) have detailed preventive actions and contingency plans
- Every risk has an assigned owner
- Mitigation actions are actionable (specific, assignable, measurable)

**Verification:**
- All four QC areas (Design, Construction, Commissioning, Documentation) have defined procedures
- QC procedures include purpose, scope, process, participants, deliverables, timeline, success criteria
- QC procedures are consistent with design-build delivery model
- QC procedures align with sibling deliverable DEL-06-01 (commissioning/closeout narrative)

**Source:** Specification.md FR-05 (QMP covers 4 QC areas); _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts (QMP components); Guidance.md Considerations (quality management considerations) [C-004 adequacy rationale]

### Step 6: Document Risk Register and QMP

**Objective:** Compile risk register and QMP into deliverable format suitable for proposal integration

**Actions:**

1. **Format Risk Register:**
   - Create table with columns: Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy (summary) | Owner | Status
   - Sort risks by Score (high to low) within each category
   - Include summary statistics: total risks, risks by category, high-priority risk count

2. **Format Mitigation Plans:**
   - For each risk, create structured mitigation plan:
     - **Risk ID and Description**
     - **Preventive Actions**
     - **Contingency Plans**
     - **Monitoring Approach**
     - **Trigger Points**
     - **Owner**
     - **Status**
   - High-priority risks (score ≥15) should have detailed mitigation plans; low-priority risks may have summary mitigation only

3. **Format Quality Management Plan:**
   - Organize by four QC areas: Design QC, Construction QC, Commissioning QC, Documentation QC
   - For each QC area, document:
     - **Overview:** Purpose and scope of QC area
     - **Checkpoints/Inspection Points:** List of QC events
     - **Procedures:** Detailed procedures for each checkpoint (purpose, scope, process, participants, deliverables, timeline, success criteria)
     - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Who performs QC activities
     - **Records:** What QC documentation is produced and retained

4. **Add Source Citations:**
   - All risks, mitigation strategies, and QC procedures must cite sources (RFP, addenda, reference reports, or labeled ASSUMPTION if inferred)
   - Mark any information gaps as **TBD** with explanation

5. **Add Document Metadata:**
   - Document title: "Risk Register and Mitigation Plan — DEL-09-01"
   - Document date
   - Document owner/author (PM + Technical Leads)
   - Document status (Draft / Final)

**Verification:**
- Risk register table is complete and accurate
- All high-priority risks have detailed mitigation plans documented
- Quality Management Plan covers all four QC areas with procedures
- All sources are cited; unsupported inferences are labeled ASSUMPTION; information gaps are marked TBD
- Document format is suitable for integration into proposal package (Markdown or PDF)

**Source:** Specification.md Documentation section (required artifacts, documentation standards); Guidance.md Principles (source fidelity over speculation)

### Step 7: Review and Integrate into Proposal Package

**Objective:** Ensure risk register and QMP are ready for proposal integration and aligned with sibling deliverables

**Actions:**

1. **Internal Review:**
   - PM reviews risk register for completeness and consistency
   - Technical Leads review risks and mitigations in their areas for accuracy
   - Estimator reviews cost risks and pricing assumptions for consistency with DEL-05-03
   - Scheduler reviews schedule risks and assumptions for consistency with DEL-08-01

2. **Cross-Deliverable Consistency Check [E-003]:**
   - Verify risk register references site conditions consistent with DEL-09-02 (Site Due Diligence Summary)
   - Verify cost risks and allowances consistent with DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions)
   - Verify schedule risks consistent with DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule)
   - Verify QMP commissioning procedures consistent with DEL-06-01 (Commissioning/Training/Closeout Narrative)

   **Consistency Merit Rationale [E-003]:** Cross-deliverable consistency demonstrates that:
   - Risk register informs schedule/pricing/QMP (risks identified in register are addressed elsewhere)
   - Mitigation costs reflected in DEL-05-03
   - Schedule contingencies account for risk timelines in DEL-08-01
   - QMP procedures align with risk categories
   - This integration shows credible, unified proposal approach vs. siloed deliverables

3. **Compliance Check [C-003]:**
   - Verify deliverable fulfills acceptance criteria (_CONTEXT.md): "Transparent; ties back to addenda clarifications and reference reports"
   - **Operationalized Thresholds:**
     - **Transparency:** All risks use standard register format with clear descriptions
     - **Grounding:** ≥95% of risks cite accessible source (RFP/addenda/reference report)
     - **Actionability:** Every risk has assigned owner + preventive/contingency action
     - **Completeness:** All 7 categories represented
   - Verify deliverable fulfills SOW-026 and SOW-027 scope requirements
   - Verify deliverable supports OBJ-008 (Manage risk & unknowns transparently)

4. **Finalize and Handoff:**
   - Update document status to Final
   - Provide deliverable to Proposal Manager for integration into proposal package
   - Confirm file format and naming convention for proposal assembly

**Verification:**
- Internal review complete with no major issues
- Cross-deliverable consistency verified
- Compliance with acceptance criteria and scope requirements confirmed
- Document finalized and handed off to Proposal Manager

**Source:** Specification.md Verification section (verification methods, acceptance criteria); _CONTEXT.md Acceptance Criteria; Decomposition §9 SOW-026, SOW-027

## Verification

### Process Verification Checkpoints

**Verification Authority [X-001]:**
- **Verification Owner:** PM
- **Verification Authority:** PM sign-off on all checkpoints required
- **Escalation:** Any checkpoint failure → document as TBD item with remediation plan before proposal integration

| Checkpoint | Verification Question | Pass Condition |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **After Step 1** | Are all required participants and materials prepared for risk identification? | Workshop scheduled, pre-read materials distributed, risk capture template ready |
| **After Step 2** | Are risks identified across all seven categories (including 2.8 Hard Constraints) with source citations? | All 7 categories + hard constraints have ≥1 risk; each risk cites a source |
| **After Step 3** | Are all risks scored with Probability, Impact, and Priority? Are scoring rationales documented? | All risks have scores with documented rationale; high-priority risks (≥15) flagged |
| **After Step 4** | Does every risk have a mitigation strategy and assigned owner? | 1:1 risk-to-mitigation mapping; all risks have owners |
| **After Step 5** | Does QMP cover all four QC areas with defined procedures? | Design, Construction, Commissioning, Documentation QC all addressed with procedures per adequacy rationale |
| **After Step 6** | Is risk register and QMP documented in deliverable format with source citations? | Document complete, formatted, cited |
| **After Step 7** | Is deliverable reviewed, consistent, compliant, and ready for proposal integration? | Internal review complete, consistency verified, compliance confirmed per operationalized thresholds |

### Deliverable Acceptance Criteria (from _CONTEXT.md)

The deliverable is acceptable when:
1. Risk register is **transparent** — all risks clearly described with rationale
2. Risk register **ties back to addenda clarifications and reference reports** — site/scope risks grounded in accessible sources
