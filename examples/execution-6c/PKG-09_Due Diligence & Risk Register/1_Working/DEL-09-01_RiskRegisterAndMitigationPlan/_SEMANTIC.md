# Deliverable: DEL-09-01 Risk Register and Mitigation Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to identify, categorize, assess, and mitigate threats to project delivery across multiple domains while embedding quality management procedures that prevent defects from propagating through design, construction, commissioning, and documentation phases. It makes uncertainty visible, actionable, and transparent so that informed decisions can be taken and stakeholder confidence can be demonstrated.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**
