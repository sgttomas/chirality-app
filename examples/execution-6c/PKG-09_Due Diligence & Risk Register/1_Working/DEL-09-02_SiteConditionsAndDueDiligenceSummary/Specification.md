Key design drivers are [A, B, C]. Cost drivers are [X, Y]. Schedule drivers are [P, Q]. This characterization grounds the following design assumptions (DEL-02-01), cost allowances (DEL-05-03), and risk responses (DEL-09-01)."

### R-16: Interdisciplinary System Synthesis (E-002)
**Requirement:** The deliverable shall document how findings from different disciplines interact to create site-wide constraints and opportunities. Examples:
1. **Geotechnical-Grading-Drainage Integration:** Soil bearing capacity + site topography + drainage requirements yields building placement strategy that optimizes foundation cost, grading cost, and drainage effectiveness.
2. **Wetland-Servicing Integration:** Wetland location + required setback + serviceability constraints yields utility routing strategy that avoids wetland while maintaining service efficiency.
3. **Flood-Grading Integration:** Flood zone elevation + site topography yields building floor elevation and grading design that ensures flood safety and minimizes earthwork cost.

**Verification:** PM confirms that synthesis shows interdisciplinary trade-offs and optimization, not just discipline-siloed constraints.

## Geotechnical Data Sufficiency Threshold (B-002)

**Question Addressed:** What is the minimum sufficient geotechnical data for proposal-stage design?

| Sufficiency Level | Required Data | Use Case |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **MINIMUM** (proposal-stage design can proceed) | Bearing capacity value + Foundation type recommendation | Concept design foundation approach; preliminary cost estimate |

**Threshold Application:** If MINIMUM data is unavailable, concept design proceeds with heightened contingency (10-15%) and ASSUMPTIONs documented. If COMPLETE data is unavailable, detailed design phase must include additional geotechnical investigation budget.

## Minimum Datasheet Content for Concept Design (F-005)

**Question Addressed:** What is the minimum Datasheet content required for concept design (DEL-02-01) to proceed?

**Minimum Required:**
1. **Site layout constraints:** 12-acre developable area, flood fringe extent, wetland setback (if known), grading slopes
2. **Geotechnical assumptions:** Typical bearing capacity range, frost depth, foundation approach (even if ASSUMPTION-based)
3. **Servicing approach:** Allowance method per Addendum 03

**Design Readiness Assessment:** If minimum is not available, concept design proceeds with heightened contingency and later redesign if TBDs are resolved differently. Design lead (DEL-02-01) should confirm minimum is met before proceeding.

**Current Status:** PARTIAL — Site layout constraints (12-acre/8-acre split) confirmed per Addendum 03. Geotechnical data TBD but ASSUMPTIONs provided. Servicing approach confirmed per Addendum 03. Concept design may proceed with documented assumptions.
