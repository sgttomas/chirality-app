# Deliverble: DEL-09-02 Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary

**Generated:** 2026-02-04
**Perspective:** This deliverable synthesizes site-specific reference studies -- geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, and flood context -- into a constraint-and-mitigation framework that informs building placement, foundation strategy, servicing assumptions, and permitting requirements, demonstrating the proponent's site understanding and supporting credible, transparent Design-Build proposal development.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
