# Guidance: DEL-09-02 Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists

This deliverable exists to demonstrate to the Town of Penhold that the Design-Build proponent has:
1. **Reviewed and understood the site-specific due diligence reports** provided in the RFP appendices (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood mapping).
2. **Identified site constraints** that affect building placement, foundation design, servicing, permitting, schedule, and cost.
3. **Proposed credible mitigation strategies** for managing site constraints, thereby reducing risk and demonstrating project readiness.
4. **Informed other proposal deliverables** (concept design, pricing, risk register, schedule) with site-specific technical inputs to ensure proposal coherence and credibility.

**Strategic value in proposal evaluation:**
- **OBJ-008: Manage risk and unknowns transparently** — This deliverable directly supports transparent risk management by surfacing site constraints and mitigation strategies early in the proposal.
- **OBJ-003: Maximize Proposed Conceptual Design score** — Site constraints inform concept design decisions (building placement, site layout, access, grading strategy), demonstrating that the concept is grounded in site realities.
- **OBJ-007: Produce a competitive, compliant price package** — Site conditions inform foundation cost, earthwork cost, servicing allowances, and risk contingencies, ensuring pricing credibility.
- **OBJ-009: Provide a believable schedule** — Site constraints (survey availability, permitting timelines, earthwork sequencing) inform schedule assumptions and critical path logic.

### Compliance and Transparency Indicators (A-004)

**Question Addressed:** What specific compliance and transparency indicators will evaluators use to assess this deliverable?

| Indicator Type | Definition | Measurement |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Compliance Indicator** | All Addendum 03 constraints explicitly cited and integrated | 100% of Addendum 03 items (12-acre area, survey timing, servicing allowance) addressed |
| **Transparency Indicator** | TBD entries justified with escalation path | Each TBD has: (1) reason for uncertainty, (2) fallback strategy, (3) escalation owner |
| **Credibility Indicator** | Mitigation strategies cross-referenced to related deliverables | Each constraint has traceable link to DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, or DEL-08-01 |

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item A-004; evaluation criteria inference

### Site Understanding Definition (E-004)

**What constitutes demonstrated "site understanding" in a proposal:**

Site Understanding = The proponent has:
1. **Reviewed** all available site due diligence reports (or documented inaccessibility)
2. **Identified** site constraints that affect design/cost/schedule
3. **Proposed** specific mitigation strategies for each constraint
4. **Documented** assumptions and TBDs transparently
5. **Demonstrated** that constraints have been incorporated into concept design, pricing, risk management, and scheduling

**Evaluator Evidence Markers:** Evaluators assess understanding by looking for:
- Report citations with specific values (not generic acknowledgments)
- Constraint-based decisions visible in design
- Cost/schedule implications quantified
- Cross-references between deliverables showing integrated planning

### Evaluation Leverage (E-007)

**How DEL-09-02 contributes to RFP scoring:**

| Evaluation Category | Point Allocation (ref: Decomposition Section 15) | DEL-09-02 Contribution |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **OBJ-008 (Manage Risk Transparently)** | Part of Delivery Plan scoring (TBD exact points) | Strong site conditions summary that identifies and mitigates constraints supports this score |
| **Concept Design Score** | 20 points | Site constraints inform concept design decisions visible to evaluators; design that respects constraints scores higher |
| **Price Score** | 35 points | Site-based cost allowances (foundation, earthwork, servicing) are credible if grounded in site conditions analysis |
| **Team/Delivery Score** | Part of Delivery Plan scoring | Site understanding demonstrates project competence and risk awareness |

**Strategic Implication:** Mapping these leverage points ensures the team invests appropriately in site analysis depth. Underdeveloped site understanding may cost points across multiple evaluation categories.

## Principles

### Underlying Engineering Rationale

#### Principle 1: Site Understanding Precedes Design

**Rationale:** In Design-Build procurement, the proponent is responsible for both design and construction risk. A thorough understanding of site conditions is essential to avoid costly surprises during construction (e.g., unanticipated foundation upgrades, environmental remediation, wetland permitting delays, utility conflicts). Demonstrating site understanding in the proposal signals design maturity and risk awareness.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Extract and synthesize key findings from all provided due diligence reports (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood).
- Do not simply restate report summaries; interpret findings in the context of the proposed building program (Fire Hall + Public Works) and site layout.
- Identify where site conditions create opportunities (e.g., favorable bearing capacity reduces foundation cost) or constraints (e.g., wetland setback limits building placement options).

**Source:** DBIA (Design-Build Institute of America) Design-Build Best Practices; AIA Design-Build contract guidance. Site understanding precedes design because Design-Build contracts allocate design and construction risk to the contractor. Thorough site investigation is essential to manage this risk. (Upgraded per _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item B-005)

---

#### Principle 2: Constraints Must Be Explicitly Linked to Mitigation

**Rationale:** Identifying constraints is necessary but insufficient. Evaluators expect proponents to propose credible mitigation strategies that demonstrate engineering judgment and project control. Mitigation strategies should be:
- **Specific:** Not generic ("We will manage risks") but concrete ("Building placement will maintain 30 m setback from wetland boundary to avoid Alberta Water Act permitting trigger").
- **Feasible:** Mitigation must be achievable within the project scope, budget, and schedule.
- **Traceable:** Each mitigation strategy should be cross-referenced to the risk register (DEL-09-01), schedule (DEL-08-01), and/or pricing assumptions (DEL-05-03) to demonstrate integrated project planning.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- For each identified constraint, propose at least one mitigation strategy.
- Assess residual risk after mitigation (low, medium, high) to inform risk register prioritization.
- Cross-reference mitigation strategies to related deliverables (e.g., "Foundation design will use spread footings on engineered fill per geotechnical recommendations; see DEL-05-03 for cost allowance").

---

#### Principle 3: Addenda Integration Is Critical to Compliance

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 clarifies several site-related constraints that directly affect this deliverable:
- **12-acre developable area** (20 acres total; 8 acres in flood fringe allocated to dog park/storm pond)
- **Survey files available after award** (not before proposal submission)
- **Site servicing allowance approach permitted** (exact tie-in points and costs TBD)

Failure to integrate these clarifications into the site conditions summary would signal non-compliance or lack of attention to addenda.

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Explicitly cite Addendum 03 when describing developable area constraints, survey assumptions, and servicing approach.
- Ensure conceptual design (DEL-02-01) respects the 12-acre developable area constraint and avoids the 8-acre flood fringe.
- Ensure pricing assumptions (DEL-05-03) reflect the allowance approach for service tie-ins and the uncertainty in earthwork quantities due to limited survey data.

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03 integration summary); Section 3 (Hard Constraints C-07: addenda acknowledgment required)

---

#### Principle 4: TBDs Are Acceptable When Transparently Justified

**Rationale:** The proposal phase operates under information constraints. Some site-specific details cannot be fully resolved until after contract award (e.g., detailed survey, wetland permitting, utility coordination with service providers). Marking items as **TBD** is acceptable when:
- The limitation is transparently acknowledged (e.g., "Exact service tie-in points TBD pending utility coordination post-award").
- The impact on design, cost, or schedule is bounded by an allowance or contingency.
- The RFP explicitly permits the TBD (e.g., Addendum 03 permits servicing allowance approach).

**Application to this deliverable:**
- Use **TBD** where reference reports are inaccessible (PDF access limitation) or where RFP permits uncertainty (e.g., survey files after award).
- Use **ASSUMPTION** where engineering judgment is applied to fill gaps (e.g., "ASSUMPTION: Frost depth 1.8 m typical for Alberta; foundation design will verify per geotechnical report recommendations").
- Do not invent data; if a critical finding is unknown, mark it **TBD** and flag the need for clarification or allowance.

**TBD Categorization (C-008 Enhancement):**
- **Known Unknown (KU):** We know a specific piece of information is missing and why. Example: "Geotechnical bearing capacity TBD — Geotechnical Report not accessible; PM to obtain." For known unknowns, state reason and fallback.
- **Unknown Unknown (UU):** We may not have identified all relevant constraints. Example: "Construction phase environmental risks TBD — will be addressed in Phase II post-award environmental assessment if Phase I raises concerns." For unknown unknowns, state that contingency allowances are included in pricing and risk register.

Evaluators prefer transparent categorization over disguised unknowns.

## Considerations

### Factors to Weigh During Production

#### Consideration 1: Balancing Technical Detail with Proposal Brevity

**Context:** This is a proposal deliverable, not a detailed design document. The audience (Town of Penhold evaluation committee) expects sufficient technical detail to demonstrate competence, but not exhaustive analysis.

**Guidance:**
- **For geotechnical findings:** Summarize key parameters (soil type, bearing capacity, groundwater depth) in a table; avoid reproducing the entire geotechnical report.
- **For wetland constraints:** State the required setback distance and permitting trigger (if any); avoid detailed wetland ecology discussion.
- **For environmental assessment:** State the clearance status or need for further investigation; avoid detailed contamination chemistry.
- **For grading and flood context:** State the developable area constraint and flood risk mitigation approach (building placement); avoid detailed civil design calculations.

**Trade-off:** More detail signals thoroughness but risks losing evaluator attention. Focus on findings that materially affect design, cost, schedule, or risk.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on proposal best practices and RFP evaluation criteria (Decomposition document Section 15: evaluation categories focus on delivery plan, concept design, and pricing)

---

#### Consideration 2: Cross-Deliverable Coordination Dependencies

**Context:** This deliverable informs (and is informed by) several other proposal deliverables:
- **DEL-02-01 (Concept Design):** Building placement must respect site constraints (wetland setbacks, flood fringe, grading).
- **DEL-05-03 (Pricing Assumptions):** Foundation type, earthwork quantities, servicing allowances must align with site conditions.
- **DEL-09-01 (Risk Register):** Site constraints must be captured as risks with mitigation strategies.
- **DEL-08-01 (Schedule):** Survey availability, permitting timelines, earthwork sequencing must align with site conditions.

**Guidance:**
- Produce this deliverable in coordination with the concept design and pricing teams (dependency mode is `NOT_TRACKED`, so coordination is manual).
- Use consistent terminology across all deliverables (e.g., "12-acre developable area," "flood fringe," "wetland setback").
- Cross-reference related deliverables where appropriate (e.g., "See DEL-02-01 for building placement strategy; see DEL-05-03 for earthwork cost allowance").

**Trade-off:** Early coordination reduces rework but requires team alignment. If coordination is delayed, inconsistencies may emerge (e.g., concept design shows building in flood fringe; site conditions summary says flood fringe is non-developable).

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 8 (DEL-09-02 downstream use); `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (NOT_TRACKED mode; coordination is external)

---

#### Consideration 3: Reference Report Accessibility Limitations

**Context:** During this agent run, the reference report PDFs (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood mapping) are not accessible due to tool limitations (PDF rendering not available). This creates a gap between ideal deliverable content (detailed findings extracted from reports) and achievable content (high-level structure with TBDs).

**Guidance:**
- Mark all report-specific findings as **TBD** where PDF access is unavailable.
- Use **ASSUMPTION** where generic engineering knowledge can safely fill gaps (e.g., "ASSUMPTION: Frost depth 1.8 m typical for Alberta").
- Flag the accessibility limitation in the document status note and conflict table (if applicable) to signal that human review and report extraction are required during working sessions.
- Structure the documents to facilitate human input (e.g., tables with TBD rows ready to be populated; narrative sections with placeholder text).

**Trade-off:** Marking items TBD is transparent but requires follow-up work. Inventing data is non-compliant with the AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol.

**Source:** AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol (non-negotiable invariants: "TBDs for unknowns"); observed tool limitation (PDF read error)

---

#### Consideration 4: Addendum 03 Site Servicing Allowance Strategy

**Context:** Addendum 03 permits the use of an allowance approach for site servicing tie-ins, acknowledging that exact connection points and costs cannot be fully determined during the proposal phase.

**Guidance:**
- State the servicing allowance strategy explicitly in this deliverable (e.g., "Municipal water and sanitary sewer tie-in costs will use an allowance approach per Addendum 03, with final connection points and routing to be confirmed during utility coordination post-award").
- Ensure the pricing assumptions deliverable (DEL-05-03) includes a corresponding allowance line item and references this site conditions summary as justification.
- Avoid over-specifying servicing details that cannot be verified without utility coordination (e.g., exact pipe diameters, connection depths); use typical values with a caveat.

**Trade-off:** Allowances reduce pricing precision but are explicitly permitted by the RFP. Overly detailed servicing design in the proposal phase risks non-compliance if assumptions prove incorrect.

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03: site servicing allowance approach); SOW-025 (show implications for design/price)

---

#### Consideration 5: Constraint-to-Design Translation (D-002)

**Context:** Design teams need explicit guidance on how site constraints translate to specific design decisions. Generic constraint statements are less actionable than translated design implications.

**Guidance — Constraint-to-Design Translation Examples:**

| Discipline | Constraint Type | Design Translation |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Geotechnical** | Bearing capacity X kPa | If X ≥ 150 kPa: spread footings feasible. If X < 100 kPa: piles or ground improvement required. |
| **Geotechnical** | Groundwater depth Y m | If Y > 2.0 m: standard perimeter drainage. If Y < 1.5 m: dewatering during construction or elevated foundation. |
| **Wetland** | Setback distance Z m | Building footprint placement boundary = Z m outside wetland edge. Access roads and utilities must also maintain setback. |
| **Flood** | Flood zone elevation A m | Building floor elevation must be ≥ (A + freeboard) m. Freeboard typically 0.3-0.6 m per jurisdiction. |
| **Grading** | Site slope B% | If B > 5%: significant cut/fill required; consider stepped foundation or retaining walls. If B < 2%: drainage may require engineered grading. |

**Application:** Use these translations to convert raw constraint data into actionable design parameters for DEL-02-01 concept design team.

---

#### Consideration 6: Credibility Demonstration (C-006, D-008)

**Context:** Purpose section asserts that this deliverable demonstrates "credibility" but does not define what evaluators look for.

**Credibility Demonstration Criteria:**

Credibility is demonstrated when the deliverable shows:
1. **Specific values** from reference reports cited with confidence levels (not just generic acknowledgments of constraints)
2. **Addendum 03 constraints** explicitly cited (12-acre area, survey timing, servicing allowance)
3. **Clear escalation paths** for TBD items with reason and fallback strategy
4. **Mitigation strategies** substantively reflected in concept design (DEL-02-01), cost model (DEL-05-03), risk register (DEL-09-01), and schedule (DEL-08-01)
5. **Consistent terminology** across all four documents and downstream deliverables

**Credibility Benchmark (D-008):**
- ≥70% of geotechnical attributes populated with specific values (or justified ASSUMPTIONs)
- Wetland/environmental constraints explicitly identified with regulatory implications
- For TBDs, clear escalation path and contingency stated
- Concept design, pricing, risk register, and schedule demonstrably incorporate site constraints

**Transparency Benchmark:**
- All constraints from reference reports cited or acknowledged
- TBDs justified with reasons and risk implications
- Assumptions labeled with rationale
- Unresolved conflicts surfaced (not hidden)

Meeting both benchmarks = strong evaluation score on OBJ-008.

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Items C-006, D-008; credibility demonstration criteria

---

#### Consideration 7: Evaluation Format Expectations (E-005)

**Context:** Guidance discusses credibility and transparency but does not specify the presentation format evaluators expect.

**Question for PM Briefing or RFP Clarification:**
"For Section 7.4 (Site Due Diligence), does the evaluation committee prefer:
(a) Narrative summary in proposal text?
(b) Tabular constraint summary?
(c) Maps/diagrams showing constraints?
(d) Professional certifications or sign-offs?
(e) Cross-references to concept design, pricing, risk register?"

**Recommended Approach (pending confirmation):** Use a combination of:
- Brief narrative summary (1-2 pages per R-15 requirement)
- Tabular constraint-to-mitigation matrix (per Example 1)
- Cross-references to related deliverables
- Professional sign-off acknowledgments (per Compliance Accountability Matrix in Specification)

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item E-005; evaluation format expectations

---

#### Consideration 8: Town of Penhold Context (E-006)

**Context:** Current guidance references generic Design-Build best practices, not Town of Penhold's specific evaluation priorities or stakeholder culture.

**Local Context Research (TBD for PM):**
1. Obtain previous proposals evaluated by Town (if available) to understand scoring patterns
2. Interview Town Project Manager about Site Due Diligence priorities (what does Penhold specifically value in risk management?)
3. Check Town bylaws for site-related permitting (noise, vibration, dust, heritage, Indigenous consultation requirements)
4. Assess stakeholder risk tolerance (conservative vs. innovation-friendly)

**Customization Opportunity:** If Town of Penhold prioritizes specific items (e.g., Indigenous consultation, community impact mitigation), add explicit requirements for those areas. Generic best practices may not fully address local priorities.

**Source:** _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md Item E-006; local context research

## Trade-offs

### Competing Concerns and Decision Guidance

#### Trade-off 1: Detailed Technical Analysis vs. Proposal Schedule

**Competing concerns:**
- **Detailed analysis:** Extracting and synthesizing findings from 5+ reference reports (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood mapping) is time-intensive and requires subject matter expertise.
- **Proposal schedule:** Proposal submission deadline (Aug 30, 2024) constrains the time available for all deliverables; over-investing in one deliverable may delay others.

**Decision guidance:**
- Prioritize extracting findings that materially affect design, cost, schedule, or risk (e.g., bearing capacity, wetland setbacks, flood constraints, survey availability).
- Deprioritize findings that are informational but not decision-critical (e.g., detailed soil chemistry, historical land use narrative).
- Use tables and constraint-to-mitigation matrices for efficient information presentation.
- Delegate detailed technical review to subject matter experts (geotechnical engineer, environmental consultant) during working sessions; agent-generated drafts are scaffolds, not final documents.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on proposal production best practices; AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol (RATIONALE: "These drafts are scaffolds")

---

#### Trade-off 2: Comprehensive Coverage vs. Risk of Inaccuracy

**Competing concerns:**
- **Comprehensive coverage:** Evaluators expect the proponent to have reviewed all provided reference reports and to demonstrate thorough site understanding.
- **Risk of inaccuracy:** Without direct access to reference report PDFs, extracting specific findings risks error (e.g., misreporting bearing capacity, wetland classification, contamination status).

**Decision guidance:**
- When reference reports are accessible, extract specific findings and cite report sections (e.g., "Bearing capacity: 150 kPa at 1.5 m depth per Geotechnical Report Section 4.2").
- When reference reports are not accessible, mark findings as **TBD** and structure the document to facilitate human input (e.g., tables with TBD rows).
- Use **ASSUMPTION** only where generic engineering knowledge applies and error risk is low (e.g., "ASSUMPTION: Frost depth 1.8 m typical for Alberta").
- Flag the accessibility limitation in a conflict table or document status note to signal that human review is required.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize accuracy over comprehensiveness. A deliverable with well-structured TBDs is more valuable than a deliverable with incorrect data.

**Source:** AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS protocol (non-negotiable invariants: "Source-anchored with explicit assumptions"; "TBDs for unknowns")

---

#### Trade-off 3: Conservative Mitigation Strategies vs. Cost Competitiveness

**Competing concerns:**
- **Conservative mitigation:** Proposing risk-averse mitigation strategies (e.g., deeper foundations, soil improvement, wetland compensation) reduces technical risk but increases cost.
- **Cost competitiveness:** Pricing evaluation is 35% of total proposal score (Decomposition document Section 15); higher costs may reduce evaluation score.

**Decision guidance:**
- Mitigation strategies should be **credible** (aligned with geotechnical recommendations, regulatory requirements) but not overly conservative.
- Where multiple mitigation options exist, present the baseline approach in the proposal and flag alternatives as value engineering opportunities (per SOW-028).
- Use allowances and contingencies to manage uncertainty (e.g., "Foundation design assumes spread footings on engineered fill per geotechnical recommendations; 10% contingency included for unforeseen soil conditions").
- Coordinate with the estimator (PKG-02 lead) to ensure mitigation strategies are reflected in pricing and that cost implications are transparent.

**Recommendation:** Aim for a "Goldilocks" mitigation strategy: not too conservative (cost-prohibitive), not too aggressive (technically risky), but credible and aligned with industry standards.

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 6 (OBJ-007: competitive price), Section 15 (35% evaluation weight on pricing); ASSUMPTION based on Design-Build risk allocation principles

---

#### Trade-off 4: Survey Assumptions vs. Design Precision

**Competing concerns:**
- **Survey assumptions:** Addendum 03 clarifies that legal survey files are available after contract award (not before proposal). Conceptual design must proceed with limited survey data (existing site grading and subdivision plan references).
- **Design precision:** Evaluators expect the concept design (DEL-02-01) to demonstrate site fit, grading feasibility, and servicing coordination; lack of survey data may introduce uncertainty.

**Decision guidance:**
- Explicitly acknowledge the survey data limitation in this deliverable and in the concept design narrative (DEL-02-01).
- State the interim basis for conceptual design (e.g., "Conceptual site layout based on available Site Grading document and Adjacent Subdivision Design reference; detailed topographic survey to be performed post-award per Addendum 03").
- Ensure the schedule (DEL-08-01) includes a post-award survey activity and any design adjustments triggered by survey findings.
- Use an earthwork quantity allowance in pricing (DEL-05-03) to bound the cost impact of survey uncertainty.

**Recommendation:** Treat the survey limitation as a managed uncertainty, not a blocker. The RFP explicitly permits this (Addendum 03), so transparency is key.

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03: survey files after award); SOW-024 (survey approach and assumptions)

## Examples

### Example 1: Constraint-to-Mitigation Matrix (Structure)

**Context:** The deliverable requires a constraint-to-mitigation mapping. Below is a template structure that can be populated during working sessions once reference reports are reviewed.

| Constraint ID | Constraint Description | Impact (Design / Cost / Schedule / Risk) | Proposed Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk | Cross-Reference |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **C-GEO-01** | TBD (e.g., Low bearing capacity requires deep foundations) | Cost: Foundation upgrade cost; Schedule: Extended foundation construction | Foundation design per geotechnical recommendations; allowance included in pricing | Medium | DEL-05-03 (foundation cost allowance); DEL-09-01 (risk register GEO-R01) |
| **C-WET-01** | TBD (e.g., Wetland setback 30 m limits building placement options) | Design: Building footprint constrained; site layout optimization required | Building placement maintains 30 m setback; access road routed to avoid wetland buffer | Low | DEL-02-01 (concept site layout); DEL-09-01 (risk register ENV-R01) |
| **C-ENV-01** | TBD (e.g., Phase I ESA identifies potential contamination requiring Phase II) | Schedule: Phase II ESA delays site development; Cost: Remediation cost if confirmed | Include Phase II ESA in post-award schedule; allowance for remediation (if required) | High | DEL-08-01 (schedule Phase II ESA activity); DEL-09-01 (risk register ENV-R02) |
| **C-FLD-01** | Flood fringe constraint: 8 acres non-developable (per Addendum 03) | Design: Building placement limited to 12-acre developable area | Confirm building placement outside flood fringe; storm pond allocated in flood fringe area | Low | DEL-02-01 (concept site layout); Addendum 03 |
| **C-SRV-01** | Service tie-in points TBD (per Addendum 03 allowance approach) | Cost: Servicing cost uncertainty; Schedule: Utility coordination post-award | Allowance for water/sewer tie-ins; utility coordination in detailed design phase | Medium | DEL-05-03 (servicing allowance); DEL-08-01 (utility coordination activity) |
| **C-SVY-01** | Survey files available after award (per Addendum 03) | Design: Conceptual design based on limited data; Schedule: Survey post-award | Use available site grading and subdivision plan for concept; detailed survey post-award | Low | DEL-02-01 (concept design basis); DEL-08-01 (post-award survey activity) |

### Example 2: Geotechnical Findings Summary (Placeholder Structure)

**Context:** Below is a placeholder structure for summarizing geotechnical findings. This will be populated during working sessions once the Geotechnical Investigation Report is reviewed.

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Soil Stratigraphy (0–3 m depth)** | TBD (e.g., Fill / Topsoil / Clay Till) | Geotechnical Report Section TBD |
| **Bearing Capacity (allowable)** | TBD (e.g., 150 kPa at 1.5 m depth) | Geotechnical Report Section TBD |
| **Groundwater Depth** | TBD (e.g., 2.5 m below grade; seasonal variation ±0.5 m) | Geotechnical Report Section TBD |
| **Foundation Type Recommendation** | TBD (e.g., Spread footings on engineered fill) | Geotechnical Report Section TBD |
| **Seismic Site Class** | TBD (e.g., Site Class C per NBCC) | Geotechnical Report Section TBD |
| **Frost Depth** | TBD (e.g., 1.8 m per ABC; footings min 2.0 m depth) | Geotechnical Report Section TBD |

**Implications for Design and Pricing:**
- **Foundation design:** TBD (e.g., Spread footings feasible; no piling required; cost savings vs. deep foundation baseline)
- **Earthwork:** TBD (e.g., Engineered fill required for foundation support; quantity TBD pending survey)
- **Groundwater management:** TBD (e.g., Perimeter drainage required; no dewatering during construction)

### Example 3: Survey Assumptions Statement (Addendum 03 Compliant)

**Context:** Addendum 03 clarifies that legal survey files are available after contract award. Below is a draft statement for this deliverable.

**Survey Approach and Assumptions:**

"Per Addendum 03, legal survey files for the project site will be provided to the Design-Builder after contract award. During the proposal phase, the conceptual site layout (DEL-02-01) has been developed using the available Site Grading document and Adjacent Subdivision Design reference to establish approximate site topography, drainage patterns, and servicing interface points.

Detailed topographic survey and legal boundary confirmation will be performed post-award as a first-phase activity (see DEL-08-01 schedule). Any design adjustments required based on survey findings (e.g., grading optimization, utility routing refinements) will be incorporated during the detailed design phase.

Earthwork quantities in the pricing package (DEL-05-03) include an allowance to account for uncertainty in cut-and-fill volumes pending detailed survey. This allowance is consistent with industry practice for Design-Build proposals with limited pre-award survey data."

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

**Status:** One conflict identified during semantic lensing (CONF-001 from _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md).

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority (PROPOSAL) | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| **CONF-001** | Flood zone area extent variance: Addendum 03 claims "8 acres flood fringe (20 acres total site, 12 acres developable)" but Flood Zone Mapping reference report is inaccessible. Reference report may contain more restrictive or different delineation. | Addendum 03 integration summary (Decomposition Section 4); Datasheet.md (lines 25-27, 59-60) | AB-2024-07156-Penhold PSB_parcel flood zone.pdf (PDF not accessible) | Datasheet Site Context; Specification R-08; Guidance Principle 3 | **PROPOSAL:** Use Addendum 03 claim (8 acres flood fringe, 12 acres developable) as basis for proposal. If Flood Zone Mapping document becomes accessible and shows different delineation, escalate to PM for RFP clarification before finalizing concept design. Apply conservative 0.5 m freeboard above Addendum 03 flood fringe boundary in design. | TBD — Requires human review of Flood Zone Mapping document |

**Escalation Protocol for CONF-001:** If Flood Zone Mapping shows <12 acres developable area, PM must:
1. Submit RFI to Town of Penhold requesting clarification
2. Hold concept design development until clarification received
3. Adjust site layout and pricing assumptions based on actual developable area

## Evaluator's Credibility Checklist (F-008)

**What evaluators look for to assess site due diligence credibility:**

| Checklist Item | Evidence Required | DEL-09-02 Section |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Specific values from reference reports cited (not just generic acknowledgments) | Report citations with page/section references; specific parameter values (bearing capacity, setback distance, etc.) | Datasheet Attributes; Guidance Examples 1-2 |
| 2. Addendum 03 constraints explicitly cited | Direct quotation or paraphrase of 12-acre developable area, survey timing, servicing allowance | Datasheet Site Context; Specification R-08, R-09, R-10; Guidance Principle 3 |
| 3. TBD reasons and fallback strategies clearly stated | Each TBD has: reason for uncertainty, fallback assumption, escalation owner | Datasheet TBD fields; Guidance Principle 4 |
| 4. Constraints visibly reflected in related deliverables | Site layout shows wetland setback (DEL-02-01); pricing includes foundation allowance (DEL-05-03); risk register ranks constraint-based risks (DEL-09-01); schedule includes permitting activities (DEL-08-01) | Cross-references throughout; Specification R-12 |
| 5. Assumptions justified with rationale or standards references | Each ASSUMPTION has: rationale statement, authoritative reference (code, standard, industry practice) | Datasheet Consolidated Assumption Register (F-007) |

**Evaluation Implication:** If proposal narrative includes evidence of all 5 checklist items, evaluators will likely perceive credibility. Missing items signal incomplete site understanding.
