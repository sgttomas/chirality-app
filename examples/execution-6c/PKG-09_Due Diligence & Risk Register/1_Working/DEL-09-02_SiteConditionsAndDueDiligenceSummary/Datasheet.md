## Evidence Quality Summary (C-003)

| Discipline | Source Document | Accessibility | % Populated vs. TBD | Confidence Level |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Geotechnical** | Geotechnical Investigation Report | Not Accessed (PDF error) | 0% populated / 100% TBD (assumptions provided) | LOW |
| **Wetland/Environmental** | Wetland Assessment, Desktop Environmental Assessment | Not Accessed (PDF error) | 0% populated / 100% TBD | LOW |
| **Grading/Drainage** | Site Grading Document | Not Accessed (PDF error) | 0% populated / 100% TBD | LOW |
| **Flood Zone** | Flood Zone Mapping; Addendum 03 | Partially Accessed (Addendum 03 only) | 40% populated / 60% TBD | MEDIUM |
| **Servicing** | Adjacent Subdivision Design | Not Accessed (PDF error) | 20% populated (Addendum 03 approach) / 80% TBD | LOW |
| **Survey** | Addendum 03 clarification | Fully Accessed | 100% populated (timing and approach) | HIGH |

## Conditions

### Normal Operating Context
- **Use case:** This deliverable supports proposal development by summarizing site constraints and due diligence findings to inform conceptual design, pricing, risk identification, and schedule planning.
- **Information flow:** Outputs from this deliverable feed into DEL-02-01 (Concept Design), DEL-05-03 (Pricing Assumptions), DEL-09-01 (Risk Register), and DEL-08-01 (Schedule).
- **Coordination mode:** Dependencies coordinated externally by humans (see `_DEPENDENCIES.md`).

**Data Flow Risk Statement (E-003):** Site conditions findings flow from this deliverable to concept design (DEL-02-01), pricing (DEL-05-03), risk register (DEL-09-01), and schedule (DEL-08-01). High-confidence findings (e.g., Addendum 03 constraints) become firm design constraints. TBD findings (e.g., geotechnical values) become assumptions with contingency allowances. If TBDs are resolved differently during detailed design than assumed in proposal, downstream deliverables may require revision. Cost and schedule contingencies in pricing and schedule reflect this TBD-resolution risk. If TBDs remain unresolved through proposal submission, design team must work within assumed ranges and maintain contingency buffers.

- **Grading design basis:** TBD pending site grading document review
- **Environmental permitting basis:** TBD pending environmental assessment review
- **Wetland avoidance/setback basis:** TBD pending wetland assessment review

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03 constraints); ASSUMPTION for detailed design basis (location TBD)

### Limiting Conditions
- **Flood fringe constraint:** 8 acres unavailable for building placement
- **Survey data constraint:** Legal survey files not available until after contract award
- **Service tie-in constraint:** Allowance approach permitted (exact connection points and costs TBD)
- **Wetland permitting constraint:** TBD (subject to Alberta Water Act if wetland disturbance required)
- **Environmental clearance constraint:** TBD (subject to environmental assessment findings)

**Source:** Decomposition document Section 4 (Addendum 03 constraints); ASSUMPTION for permitting requirements

## Construction

*Note: This deliverable is a summary document (non-physical artifact); construction details not applicable.*

**Construction methodology for this deliverable:**
- **Production process:** Aggregate findings from multiple reference studies (geotech, wetland, environmental, grading, flood mapping) into a concise summary narrative with constraint-to-mitigation mapping.
- **Key steps:** Review all reference reports, extract key findings, identify constraints, propose mitigation strategies, validate against RFP requirements and addenda.
- **Quality control:** Cross-check findings against RFP Section 7.4 requirements and Addendum 03 clarifications; ensure consistency with concept design assumptions.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on deliverable type and acceptance criteria in `_CONTEXT.md`

| **ASSUM-002** | Alberta Water Act authorization likely required if wetland disturbance | Standard regulatory requirement for Alberta wetland impacts | Alberta Water Act, Code of Practice | If authorization not required, permitting timeline could be shorter; if requirements more stringent, schedule impact | Wetland Assessment Report review to confirm trigger; consult environmental specialist | TBD pending Wetland Assessment review |
| **ASSUM-003** | Typical bearing capacity range 100-200 kPa for Alberta clay till | Central Alberta glacial deposits typically provide adequate bearing for conventional foundations | Regional geotechnical practice | If bearing < 100 kPa, deep foundations or ground improvement needed; cost increase $50K-$200K | Geotechnical report bearing capacity value; compare to assumption; flag if deviation >20% | TBD pending Geotechnical Report review |
| **ASSUM-004** | Site Class D seismic per NBCC for Alberta glacial soils | Typical soil conditions in central Alberta correspond to Site Class D | NBCC seismic provisions; Alberta geotechnical norms | If Site Class E, more stringent seismic design required; structural cost increase | Geotechnical report seismic classification; compare to assumption | TBD pending Geotechnical Report review |

**Assumption Verification Timeline (E-008):** Each assumption with TBD status should be verified immediately upon source document access (expected before detailed design phase). Verification method: compare source document value to assumption; if matches within tolerance, CONFIRMED; if differs significantly, REVISED with cost/schedule impact assessment escalated to PM.
