## CONFLICT LOG

| Conflict ID | Issue | Source A | Source B | Status | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CONF-001** | Flood zone area extent variance: Addendum 03 claims "8 acres flood fringe (20 acres total site, 12 acres developable)" but Flood Zone Mapping reference report is inaccessible. Reference report may contain more restrictive or different delineation. | Addendum 03 integration summary (Decomposition Section 4); Datasheet.md (lines 25–27, 59–60) | AB-2024-07156-Penhold PSB_parcel flood zone.pdf (location TBD — PDF not accessible) | Unresolved | TBD — Requires human review of Flood Zone Mapping document to confirm Addendum 03 area claim. If report shows different constraint (e.g., 5 acres developable vs. 12 acres claimed), escalate to PM for RFP clarification before finalizing concept design. |

## LENSING FINDINGS BY MATRIX

### Matrix A — Orientation (Normative/Operative/Evaluative; Guiding/Applying/Judging/Reviewing)

**Total warranted items: 5**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-001 | MissingSlot | Specification | Regulatory compliance mandate section missing | RFP Section 7.4 and Addendum 03 establish a mandate that site conditions be synthesized and integrated; Specification lacks explicit mandate section. | Add Specification opening: "Compliance Mandate: This deliverable shall achieve 100% compliance with RFP Section 7.4 (site understanding requirement) and Addendum 03 (site constraints and assumptions). All mandatory elements must be addressed or explicitly flagged as TBD." |
| A-002 | VerificationGap | Specification | Verification methods for regulatory compliance are descriptive, not normative | Specification Section Verification (R-03, R-04: wetland compliance) states "Review of Wetland Assessment Report" but no explicit compliance determination step exists. | Add verification criterion: "Compliance determination: Environmental lead confirms that site conditions summary accurately represents wetland constraints per Addendum 03 and Alberta Water Act requirements. Verification result: PASS/FAIL/TBD." |
| A-003 | WeakStatement | Procedure | No enforcement mechanism for regulatory compliance sign-off | Procedure describes production steps but lacks an explicit authority checkpoint for regulatory compliance validation before proposal submission. | Add Procedure Step 8 (after Step 7): "Regulatory Compliance Sign-Off: PM obtains written confirmation from relevant authorities (environmental consultant for wetland/environmental, structural engineer for geotechnical, civil engineer for grading/flood) that site conditions summary accurately reflects regulatory requirements and constraints." |
| A-004 | TBD_Question | Guidance | Purpose section references compliance and transparency but lacks quantifiable compliance indicators | Purpose section (lines 13–18) asserts this deliverable demonstrates compliance and transparency, but "transparent" and "credible" lack measurable definitions. | Question: "What specific compliance and transparency indicators will evaluators use to assess this deliverable?" Propose: transparency = TBD entries justified with escalation path; compliance = all Addendum 03 constraints cited; credibility = mitigation strategies cross-referenced to related deliverables. |
| A-005 | MissingSlot | Datasheet | Document status field in Identification table (line 13) shows "OPEN (document generation in progress)" — inconsistent with _STATUS.md (SEMANTIC_READY) | Datasheet Identification section has stale status value that contradicts _STATUS.md. | Update Datasheet line 13: Status: "SEMANTIC_READY (per _STATUS.md; ready for CHIRALITY_LENS semantic lensing and 4_DOCUMENTS enrichment)." |

### Matrix B — Conceptualization (Data/Information/Knowledge/Wisdom; Necessity/Sufficiency/Completeness/Consistency)

**Total warranted items: 6**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-001 | MissingSlot | Datasheet | All geotechnical data fields (soil stratigraphy, bearing capacity, groundwater depth, foundation type, seismic class) are TBD | Required data per R-01 is missing due to reference report inaccessibility. Deliverable cannot demonstrate site understanding without geotechnical data. | (1) Populate placeholder values with typical Alberta ranges where safe (e.g., "ASSUMPTION: Frost depth 1.8 m typical for Alberta; final value per Geotechnical Report"). (2) Create contingency: "If Geotechnical Report becomes accessible before proposal submission, populate specific values. If not accessible, use typical-value assumptions with 10% cost contingency for unforeseen soil conditions." |
| B-002 | TBD_Question | Specification | No sufficiency threshold defined for geotechnical data completeness | R-01 requires "summarize key geotechnical findings" but does not define what subset would constitute a minimally sufficient summary (bearing capacity alone vs. full stratigraphy + groundwater). | Question: "What is the minimum sufficient geotechnical data for proposal-stage design?" Propose: (1) Minimum = bearing capacity value + foundation type recommendation. (2) Complete = minimum + soil stratigraphy + groundwater depth + seismic class + frost depth. Define this threshold in revised R-01. |
| B-003 | MissingSlot | Datasheet | No inventory of source document review status (which of 10 reference documents have been reviewed vs. remain inaccessible) | Inventory lens requires complete tracking of data sources; Datasheet does not show which sources were reviewed and which are pending. | Add new Datasheet section: "Source Review Inventory" showing for each document: (1) Title. (2) Status: Fully Accessible / Partially Accessible / Not Accessible. (3) Key findings extracted (yes/no). (4) TBD items and reason. Example: "Geotechnical Investigation Report — Status: Not Accessible (PDF not accessible); Findings: Not extracted; TBD items: Soil stratigraphy, bearing capacity, groundwater depth, foundation recommendations; Reason: PDF read error; Escalation: PM to obtain from Project Manager." |
| B-004 | Conflict | Multi | Status field inconsistency: Datasheet shows "OPEN (document generation in progress)" but _STATUS.md shows "SEMANTIC_READY" | Two authoritative documents show different status. _STATUS.md is post-generation while Datasheet may be pre-generation template text. | Reconcile: _STATUS.md (SEMANTIC_READY) is authoritative. Update Datasheet and all four documents to use SEMANTIC_READY status. Update line 144 (Datasheet) and equivalent lines in Specification, Guidance, Procedure from "Pass 3 complete (all enrichment passes completed) — Ready for working sessions" to "SEMANTIC_READY state — awaiting semantic lensing and enrichment passes." |
| B-005 | RationaleGap | Guidance | Principle 1 (Site Understanding Precedes Design) rationale relies on generic ASSUMPTION rather than citing design-build authority | Principle 1 (lines 27–35) bases its rationale on "ASSUMPTION based on Design-Build best practices" without a specific reference. | Upgrade Principle 1 rationale: Cite DBIA (Design-Build Institute of America) or AIA Design-Build contract practices as authority. E.g., "Site understanding precedes design because Design-Build contracts allocate design and construction risk to the contractor. Thorough site investigation is essential to manage this risk. See DBIA Design-Build Best Practices or AIA Design-Build contract guidance." Grounds principle in external authority. |
| B-006 | TBD_Question | Procedure | No prerequisite criticality classification (which reference documents are blocking vs. nice-to-have) | Procedure Prerequisites (lines 37–53) lists all 10 reference documents equally but their absence has different impacts. E.g., Geotechnical Report is blocking for foundation design; flood mapping is blocking for site layout; environmental assessment may be TBD until Phase II. | Classify prerequisites: (1) BLOCKING (must have before concept design): Geotechnical Report, Flood Zone Mapping, Wetland Assessment, Site Grading. (2) IMPORTANT (should have): Adjacent Subdivision Design, Environmental Assessment. (3) NICE-TO-HAVE (can proceed with TBD): specific code sections. Define which tier allows proceeding with TBDs. |

### Matrix C — Formulation (Normative/Operative/Evaluative; Necessity/Sufficiency/Completeness/Consistency)

**Total warranted items: 8**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-001 | MissingSlot | Specification | No binding regulatory authority identified for any requirement (all standards listed as ASSUMPTION) | Specification Standards section (lines 187–200) lists codes as "likely applicable; reference text not accessible." Binding authority must be explicitly identified for each requirement. | Create Specification section: "Binding Regulatory Authority." For each requirement (R-01 through R-12), identify the binding authority: R-01/R-02 (Geotechnical) → Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual + Alberta Building Code Section [TBD]. R-03/R-04 (Wetland) → Alberta Water Act, Code of Practice. R-05/R-06 (Environmental) → Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act. Etc. Specify which authority governs compliance for each requirement. |
| C-002 | MissingSlot | Datasheet | No attribute addresses Indigenous land considerations, archaeological constraints, or heritage resource constraints | Comprehensive constraint documentation requires standard Alberta due diligence items. None of these are mentioned in Datasheet despite being mandatory in Alberta construction permitting. | Add new Datasheet section: "Indigenous and Cultural Considerations." Document: (1) Indigenous consultation requirements (per Alberta protocols). (2) Archaeological assessment status (Phase 1 screening completed or TBD). (3) Heritage resource constraints (if applicable). Source: Alberta Historical Resources Act, Town of Penhold protocols. Status: TBD (to be confirmed during detailed design phase). |
| C-003 | MissingSlot | Datasheet | Source accessibility not documented systematically; readers cannot quickly see which findings are evidence-anchored vs. assumed | Evidence-anchored baseline requires transparent source status. Current Datasheet marks items "location TBD — PDF not accessible" scattered throughout, making it hard to assess overall evidence quality. | Add Datasheet meta-section: "Evidence Quality Summary." Tabular form: (1) Discipline. (2) Source document. (3) Accessibility: Fully Accessed / Partially Accessed / Not Accessed. (4) % findings populated vs. TBD. (5) Confidence level (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW). Example: "Geotechnical Conditions | Geotechnical Investigation Report | Not Accessed (PDF error) | 0% populated / 100% TBD | LOW." Summary: "70% of required data is evidence-anchored (accessible sources); 30% is TBD pending source access." Evaluators can then calibrate proposal credibility accordingly. |
| C-004 | TBD_Question | Specification | Actionable engineering sufficiency for Guidance examples not defined | Guidance Examples 1–3 (Constraint-to-Mitigation Matrix, Geotechnical Findings Table, Survey Assumptions) are templates, but no guidance on how detailed they should be for working teams to populate them. | Question: "Are the Example templates detailed enough for engineering teams to populate during working sessions?" Propose: Expand Guidance Examples with column definitions and sample data rows (not just headers). E.g., Example 1: "Constraint-to-Mitigation Matrix — Column Definitions: Constraint ID: unique identifier (e.g., C-GEO-01 for geotechnical constraint 1). Constraint Description: specific constraint from reference report with citation. Impact (Design/Cost/Schedule/Risk): quantified impact (e.g., 'Cost: +$50K for engineered fill; Schedule: +2 weeks for soil testing'). Proposed Mitigation: specific action to address constraint. Residual Risk: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH after mitigation. Cross-Reference: citations to DEL-02-01 site layout, DEL-05-03 cost allowance, DEL-09-01 risk register entry, DEL-08-01 schedule activity." More detail = more actionable. |
| C-005 | WeakStatement | Specification | Interdisciplinary conflict resolution not addressed | Integrated multi-disciplinary synthesis requires explicit handling of cross-discipline conflicts. Requirements R-01–R-10 treat each discipline independently; what happens when geotechnical recommendations conflict with wetland setbacks, or grading conflicts with flood constraints? | Add Specification Requirement: "R-13: Interdisciplinary Conflict Resolution. The deliverable shall identify and propose resolution for any conflicts between discipline-specific constraints. Examples: (1) If geotechnical recommends shallow foundation but flood zone requires higher floor elevation, propose integrated foundation solution (e.g., elevated shallow foundation on piers). (2) If wetland setback conflicts with building placement options on 12-acre site, propose layout optimization or setback waiver request strategy. Verification: PM + multi-discipline review panel confirms all identified conflicts have proposed resolutions, and no unresolved conflicts remain." |
| C-006 | TBD_Question | Guidance | Credibility demonstration criterion not defined | Purpose section (lines 5–19) asserts "demonstrates site understanding" and "credibility" but does not define what evaluators look for to judge credibility. | Question: "What evidence demonstrates credibility to evaluators?" Propose: Credibility demonstrated by: (1) Specific values from reference reports cited with confidence levels. (2) Constraints explicitly cross-referenced to Addendum 03. (3) For TBD items, clear escalation path and contingency allowance. (4) Mitigation strategies substantively reflected in concept design (DEL-02-01), cost model (DEL-05-03), risk register (DEL-09-01), and schedule (DEL-08-01). (5) Terminology and assumptions consistent across all four documents and downstream deliverables. Meeting these 5 criteria = credible. |
| C-007 | MissingSlot | Procedure | No readiness gate or proposal-submission checklist | Procedure Step 7 says "finalize" but no objective readiness criteria confirm the deliverable is proposal-ready before handoff to proposal compilation. | Add Procedure Step 8: "Proposal Readiness Gate. Before releasing DEL-09-02 for proposal integration, confirm: (1) ☐ All accessible reference reports have been reviewed; inaccessible reports flagged with justification. (2) ☐ Constraint-to-Mitigation matrix populated with ≥5 material constraints and proposed mitigations. (3) ☐ All Addendum 03 clarifications (12-acre developable area, survey timing, servicing allowance) are explicitly cited. (4) ☐ No unresolved conflicts remain (or CONF-001 type conflicts are escalated to PM for ruling). (5) ☐ Cross-references to DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01 are reciprocated (downstream documents cite back to DEL-09-02). (6) ☐ Terminology standardized across all four documents. (7) ☐ All TBDs justified; all ASSUMPTIONs labeled. If all checks pass: READY FOR PROPOSAL. If any fails: HOLD FOR REVISION." |
| C-008 | RationaleGap | Guidance | Transparent risk acknowledgment lacks explicit categorization of known vs. unknown unknowns | Guidance Principle 4 (TBDs Are Acceptable When Transparently Justified) addresses TBD handling but does not distinguish between known unknowns (e.g., "Geotechnical Report not accessible") and unknown unknowns (e.g., subsurface conditions we haven't anticipated). Communicating this distinction improves evaluator confidence. | Enhance Principle 4: "TBD categorization: (1) Known Unknown (KU): We know a specific piece of information is missing and why. E.g., 'Geotechnical bearing capacity TBD — Geotechnical Report not accessible; PE to obtain.' (2) Unknown Unknown (UU): We may not have identified all relevant constraints. E.g., 'Construction phase environmental risks TBD — will be addressed in Phase II post-award environmental assessment if Phase I raises concerns.' For known unknowns, state reason and fallback. For unknown unknowns, state that contingency allowances are included in pricing and risk register. Evaluators prefer transparent categorization over disguised unknowns." |

### Matrix F — Requirements (Normative/Operative/Evaluative; Necessity/Sufficiency/Completeness/Consistency)

**Total warranted items: 8**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | MissingSlot | Specification | Regulatory compliance accountability not assigned | Specification lists requirements but does not assign accountability for confirming compliance. Who is responsible for signing off that R-01 (Geotechnical Findings) is accurate and compliant? | Add Specification section: "Compliance Accountability Matrix." Table: Requirement | Responsible Role | Verification Authority. Example: R-01/R-02 (Geotechnical) | Structural/Geotechnical Engineer | P.Eng. stamp + PM review. R-03/R-04 (Wetland) | Environmental/Civil Engineer | Environmental consultant + Alberta Water Act authority (if applicable). R-05/R-06 (Environmental) | Environmental Consultant | Phase I ESA provider + PM. Etc. Assigns clear ownership for each requirement's compliance verification. |
| F-002 | VerificationGap | Specification | Verification methods describe documentation completeness, not mitigation feasibility | R-11 verification: "Engineering review by PM and technical leads; cross-check against risk register (DEL-09-01)." This checks that mitigations are documented, not that they are technically sound or feasible. | Enhance R-11 verification: "Mitigation Feasibility Check. For each proposed mitigation strategy, confirm: (1) Is the strategy consistent with applicable codes/standards? (2) Is the strategy feasible within project budget and schedule? (3) Does the strategy reduce residual risk to acceptable level (per DEL-09-01 risk tolerance)? (4) Are cost/schedule implications of mitigation reflected in DEL-05-03 and DEL-08-01? Verification result: FEASIBLE / QUESTIONABLE / INFEASIBLE. If QUESTIONABLE or INFEASIBLE, loop back to PM for mitigation revision." |
| F-003 | MissingSlot | Specification | Construction-phase constraints not addressed (noise, vibration, dust, traffic impact) | Exhaustive constraint identification should include construction-impact constraints on adjacent properties and residents. These are typically due diligence items for municipal buildings near existing development. | Add Specification Requirement: "R-13: Construction Phase Constraints. The deliverable shall identify construction-phase impacts on adjacent development (noise ordinance limits, vibration limits, dust suppression requirements, traffic management on adjacent roads). Status: TBD pending detailed construction methodology (DEL-04-01) and adjacent land use assessment. Verification: Civil/Environmental lead and PM confirm construction phase constraints are identified and mitigation strategies proposed." |
| F-004 | WeakStatement | Procedure | Step 2 extraction guidance lacks a structured protocol for recording evidence | Procedure Step 2 instructs "Extract key findings" but does not specify extraction format, citation requirements, or confidence rating mechanism. Unstructured extraction risks inconsistency and lost traceability. | Codify extraction protocol: "Step 2 Protocol — Evidence Extraction Form. For each reference report, populate: (1) Report Title. (2) Date + Author Credentials. (3) Investigation Methodology. (4) For each key finding: Finding Statement | Report Citation (page/section) | Key Data Values | Confidence Level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) | Related Constraints. Use consistent format across all reports. Create extraction form template for team to populate during working sessions." Structured protocol ensures traceability and consistency. |
| F-005 | TBD_Question | Datasheet | Design informativeness of current Datasheet (mostly TBD) unclear | Current Datasheet is largely TBD. Is it adequate to inform conceptual design (DEL-02-01)? If not, what minimum data must be populated first? | Question: "What is the minimum Datasheet content required for concept design to proceed?" Propose: Minimum = (1) Site layout constraints: 12-acre developable area, flood fringe extent, wetland setback (if known), grading slopes. (2) Geotechnical assumptions: typical bearing capacity range, frost depth, foundation approach. (3) Servicing approach: allowance method per Addendum 03. If minimum is not available, concept design proceeds with heightened contingency and later redesign if TBDs are resolved differently. Design lead (DEL-02-01) should confirm minimum is met before proceeding. |
| F-006 | MissingSlot | Specification | No holistic site characterization narrative requirement | Current requirements (R-01–R-12) are discipline-siloed (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, etc.). No requirement for an integrated site characterization statement that synthesizes all findings into a unified design driver summary. | Add Specification Requirement: "R-13: Integrated Site Characterization. The deliverable shall include a 1–2 page unified site characterization narrative that synthesizes all discipline findings (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood, servicing) into a coherent statement of key site conditions and design drivers. Example: 'The Penhold Public Services Building site is characterized by [soil type, bearing capacity], [wetland presence/setback], [environmental status], [flood zone extent], and [service availability]. Key design drivers are [A, B, C]. Cost drivers are [X, Y]. Schedule drivers are [P, Q]. This characterization grounds the following design assumptions (DEL-02-01), cost allowances (DEL-05-03), and risk responses (DEL-09-01).' Verification: PM confirms synthesis is clear and is consistent with discipline-specific sections." |
| F-007 | Normalization | Multi | Assumptions scattered across all four documents with no consolidated assumption register | Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure each include assumptions (e.g., frost depth 1.8 m; Alberta Water Act applicability; design-build best practices). Scattered assumptions risk inconsistent propagation to downstream deliverables. | Consolidate assumptions: Add new Datasheet section: "Consolidated Assumption Register." Collect all ASSUMPTIONs from all four documents into one table: Assumption ID | Assumption Statement | Rationale | Source | Risk If Wrong | Verification Plan | Status. Example: "ASSUM-001 | Frost depth 1.8 m per Alberta Building Code typical values. | Alberta has consistent frost penetration patterns; actual site conditions to be confirmed by geotech. | Alberta Building Code climatic data. | If actual frost depth > 1.8 m, foundations deeper than designed → cost overrun. | Geotechnical report will confirm; compare geotechnical recommendation to assumption; adjust if needed. | TBD pending Geotechnical Report review." Centralization aids traceability and risk management. |
| F-008 | TBD_Question | Guidance | Credibility assurance standard not defined for evaluators | Purpose section claims this deliverable assures proposal credibility but does not define what evaluators will look for. Guidance discusses credibility aspirationally. | Question: "What specific presentation format and content depth does the evaluation committee expect to assess credibility?" Propose: Define in Guidance: "Evaluator's Credibility Checklist: (1) Are specific values from reference reports cited (not just generic acknowledgments of constraints)? (2) Are Addendum 03 constraints explicitly cited? (3) For TBDs, are reasons and fallback strategies clearly stated? (4) Are constraints visibly reflected in related deliverables (site layout shows wetland setback, pricing includes foundation allowance, risk register ranks constraint-based risks, schedule includes permitting activities)? (5) Are assumptions justified with rationale or standards references (not invented)? If proposal narrative includes evidence of all 5 checklist items, evaluators will likely perceive credibility." |

### Matrix D — Objectives (Normative/Operative/Evaluative; Guiding/Applying/Judging/Reviewing)

**Total warranted items: 8**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | MissingSlot | Procedure | No compliance governance structure defined | Procedure lists "PM + Technical Leads" but does not define how compliance decisions are made (who decides when a regulatory requirement is met?) or escalation path for disputes. | Add Procedure section: "Compliance Governance Structure. (1) PM is accountable for overall compliance framework. (2) For each discipline (geotech, wetland, environmental, grading, flood, servicing), Technical Lead is responsible for interpreting findings and determining regulatory compliance. (3) If Technical Lead and PM disagree on compliance interpretation, escalate to external authority: for wetland/environmental, Alberta Environment; for geotechnical/grading, Professional Engineer; for servicing, municipal utility department. (4) PM documents all compliance determinations and disputes in the Assumption Register (ASSUM-001 type entries). (5) Unresolved compliance disputes are flagged as TBD and escalated to Proposal Manager for RFP clarification or PM decision." |
| D-002 | MissingSlot | Guidance | No guidance on translating site constraints into specific design decisions | Guidance discusses principles but not the mechanics of constraint-to-design translation. E.g., how does a geotechnical bearing capacity value translate to foundation type selection? How do wetland setbacks translate to building placement constraints? | Enhance Guidance with new subsection: "Constraint-to-Design Translation Examples." For each discipline: (1) Geotechnical: If bearing capacity is X kPa, foundation type is [spread footings / piles / engineered fill]. If groundwater depth is Y m, foundation waterproofing approach is [perimeter drainage / dewatering / elevated foundation]. (2) Wetland: If setback distance is Z m, building footprint placement boundary is [Z m outside wetland edge]. (3) Flood: If flood zone elevation is A m, building floor elevation must be ≥ [A + freeboard] m. (4) Grading: If site slope is B%, building placement constrained to [areas within slope tolerance]. Explicit translation guidance helps design teams understand how constraints bind design choices. |
| D-003 | VerificationGap | Specification | Verification for flood zone context (R-08) is only partial | R-08 status is "Partial" because detailed flood elevation data is TBD. But conformance to site realities requires that flood zone conformance is confirmed (not just partially known). | Upgrade R-08 verification: "Full Status Trigger: Once Flood Zone Mapping document is accessible, extract: (1) Flood fringe elevation. (2) Floodway elevation (if applicable). (3) Freeboard requirement. (4) Confirm that Addendum 03 claim (8-acre flood fringe, 12-acre developable area) aligns with mapping. Verification result: (1) If mapping aligns with Addendum 03 → CONFORM. (2) If mapping shows tighter constraint → CONFLICT (escalate to PM for RFP clarification). (3) If mapping is unavailable → TBD (use conservative assumption: design building to 0.5 m above Addendum 03 flood fringe boundary)." |
| D-004 | VerificationGap | Specification | Mitigation effectiveness verification absent; only documentation completeness checked | R-11 verification checks "mitigations are documented" but not whether they are technically sound or will actually reduce risk. | Enhance R-11 verification: "Mitigation Effectiveness Test: For each proposed mitigation, technical lead confirms: (1) Mitigation is consistent with applicable standards (cite code section). (2) Mitigation is reflected in downstream deliverables (concept design shows design change, pricing includes cost, schedule includes activity, risk register shows risk reduction). (3) Residual risk assessment is credible (not optimistic). Verification result: EFFECTIVE / QUESTIONABLE / INEFFECTIVE. If INEFFECTIVE, loop back to mitigation proposal step for revision." |
| D-005 | WeakStatement | Procedure | Coordination mechanism for propagating site understanding to downstream deliverables not defined (NOT_TRACKED mode) | Procedure Step 6 describes coordination but NOT_TRACKED dependency mode means no formal mechanism. Coordination is ad hoc and may fail silently. | Formalize propagation: "Step 6 Enhanced Protocol: (1) PM drafts Site Conditions Propagation Checklist: [list all constraints]. (2) PM distributes checklist to leads of DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01. (3) Each lead reviews checklist and confirms: 'Constraint [X] addressed in our deliverable at [section Y]' or 'Constraint [X] not applicable to our deliverable; justification: [reason]' or 'Constraint [X] TBD pending [information].' (4) PM consolidates responses. Any TBD or missing response triggers PM follow-up. (5) PM maintains propagation record (who confirmed what, when). Formal tracking ensures nothing falls through the cracks." |
| D-006 | MissingSlot | Procedure | No synthesis-based proposal readiness assessment | Procedure Step 7 says "finalize" but does not assess whether the synthesis is proposal-ready. | Add to Procedure Step 7: "Synthesis Readiness Assessment: Before releasing for proposal integration, PM assesses: (1) Does the site characterization narrative (unified synthesis from F-006) clearly communicate key design drivers, cost drivers, and schedule drivers? (2) Are all 4 documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure) internally consistent (terminology, values, cross-references)? (3) Are all 4 documents consistent with downstream deliverables (same constraints, same terminology, same cross-references)? (4) Are all TBDs justified and flagged? (5) Are all assumptions labeled and rationale provided? Assessment result: READY / REQUIRES REVISION. If READY, proceed to proposal integration. If REQUIRES REVISION, loop back to PM for targeted fixes." |
| D-007 | MissingSlot | Procedure | No audit for assumption consistency across deliverables | Assumptions made in DEL-09-02 may contradict assumptions in DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01. No formal audit detects these contradictions. | Add Procedure Step 8: "Cross-Deliverable Assumption Audit. After all five deliverables (DEL-09-02, DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01) have drafted their content, PM consolidates all assumptions from all documents into a single Assumption Registry. Audit: For each assumption in DEL-09-02, verify: (1) Is the same assumption stated in downstream deliverables? (2) If yes, are the rationales and values consistent? (3) If no, is the absence justified (e.g., assumption not applicable to downstream deliverable)? (4) Are there contradictory assumptions (e.g., DEL-09-02 assumes frost depth 1.8 m, DEL-05-03 assumes 2.2 m)? Audit result: CONSISTENT / INCONSISTENT. If INCONSISTENT, resolve via PM decision and update all affected documents." |
| D-008 | TBD_Question | Guidance | Credibility and transparency benchmarks not defined for evaluators | Purpose section asserts OBJ-008 ("Manage risk and unknowns transparently") but does not define what evaluators will use as credibility/transparency benchmarks in scoring. | Question: "What are the specific evaluation benchmarks for credibility and transparency?" Propose: Define in Guidance: "Credibility Benchmark: Proposal demonstrates credibility if (1) ≥70% of geotechnical attributes are populated with specific values (not all TBD), (2) Wetland/environmental constraints are explicitly identified with regulatory implications, (3) For TBDs, clear escalation path and contingency are stated, (4) Concept design, pricing, risk register, and schedule demonstrably incorporate site constraints. Transparency Benchmark: Proposal demonstrates transparency if (1) All constraints from reference reports are cited or acknowledged, (2) TBDs are justified with reasons and risk implications, (3) Assumptions are labeled with rationale, (4) Unresolved conflicts are surfaced (not hidden). Meeting both benchmarks = strong evaluation score on OBJ-008." |

**Total warranted items: 4**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| X-001 | VerificationGap | Specification | Foundational verification prerequisites not met (reference reports not accessible) | Verification methods (R-01 through R-10) all require "Review of [Report]" but foundational basis (access to reports) does not exist. Verification cannot proceed without accessible evidence sources. | Establish pre-verification gate: "Before verification methods in R-01 through R-10 can be performed, confirm: (1) Geotechnical Investigation Report is accessible and reviewed. (2) Wetland Assessment Report is accessible and reviewed. (3) Environmental Assessment Report is accessible and reviewed. (4) Site Grading document is accessible and reviewed. (5) Flood Zone Mapping is accessible and reviewed. For any report marked NOT ACCESSIBLE, either (a) PM obtains alternate source, or (b) verification is deferred and TBD is documented with escalation date." Without this gate, verification methods cannot be executed. |
| X-002 | MissingSlot | Procedure | Discipline coverage checklist absent from finalization step | Step 7 finalizes but does not verify that all disciplines (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood, servicing, survey) have been adequately addressed. | Add to Procedure Step 7: "Discipline Coverage Verification Checklist: Before finalizing, confirm ☐ Geotechnical findings summarized with constraints identified. ☐ Wetland findings summarized with setback/permitting implications. ☐ Environmental findings summarized with clearance status. ☐ Grading/drainage context summarized with earthwork implications. ☐ Flood zone context summarized with building placement strategy. ☐ Servicing context summarized with allowance approach. ☐ Survey approach and assumptions documented. ☐ Constraint-to-mitigation mapping addresses constraints from all disciplines. If any discipline is uncovered, loop back and add missing section." |
| X-003 | MissingSlot | Specification | Cross-deliverable consistency verification lacks a defined demonstration method | R-12 acceptance criterion is "Terminology, site constraints, and assumptions consistent across all related deliverables" but no method specified for how consistency will be demonstrated. Verification is subjective without a defined method. | Define consistency demonstration method: "Consistency Verification Method: Create Traceability Matrix with columns: (1) Constraint ID (from DEL-09-02). (2) Constraint Description. (3) Referenced in DEL-02-01 (yes/no; cite section). (4) Referenced in DEL-05-03 (yes/no; cite section). (5) Referenced in DEL-09-01 (yes/no; cite section). (6) Referenced in DEL-08-01 (yes/no; cite section). (7) Terminology Match (same words/values across references? yes/no). (8) Consistency Status (ALIGNED / MISALIGNED / N/A). For all constraints: 100% should be ALIGNED or N/A. If any constraint is MISALIGNED, document reason and resolution plan." |
| X-004 | MissingSlot | Specification | Quality Control Checkpoints (Procedure lines 333–340) are listed but not assigned or tracked | Procedure lists 7 quality control checkpoints but does not assign them to responsible parties, define completion timeline, or track results. Checkpoints become aspirational without tracking. | Enhance Procedure QC checkpoints: "For each listed checkpoint (context review, findings extraction, constraint identification, mitigation proposal, Addendum 03 integration, deliverable coordination, documents finalization, status update), assign: (1) Responsible Role. (2) Completion Deadline. (3) Verification Criteria (what does PASS look like?). (4) Sign-off Authority (who confirms PASS?). (5) Escalation Path (if FAIL). Maintain QC Tracking Log: [Checkpoint] | Responsible Role | Due Date | Status (PENDING/IN_PROGRESS/PASS/FAIL) | Sign-off Date. Update log weekly during working sessions. Any FAIL checkpoint triggers corrective action loop before proceeding." |

### Matrix E — Evaluation (Normative/Operative/Evaluative; Necessity/Sufficiency/Completeness/Consistency)

**Total warranted items: 8**

| Item ID | Type | AppliesToDoc | Description | Why Warranted | Proposed Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-001 | MissingSlot | Datasheet | Climate/weather constraints absent | Exhaustive constraint documentation should include site-specific climate constraints (freeze-thaw cycles, snow load, wind exposure, precipitation patterns) that affect design and construction planning. These are standard Alberta due diligence items. | Add Datasheet section: "Climate and Weather Constraints." Document: (1) Freeze-Thaw Cycles: Frost depth TBD (see Geotechnical). (2) Snow Load: Roof design basis per Alberta Building Code climatic data (TBD). (3) Wind Exposure: Wind speed zone per Alberta Building Code (TBD). (4) Precipitation: Drainage design basis per site grading and Alberta climate norms (TBD). (5) Construction Season: Optimal construction window for Alberta (typically May–October; permitting/grading may constrain). Source: Alberta Building Code climatic data; Project schedule implications: phasing to account for seasonal constraints. Status: Mostly TBD pending design standards application; seasonal constraint known. |
| E-002 | MissingSlot | Specification | Interdisciplinary synthesis requirement absent | Synthesized multi-disciplinary investigation requires showing how disciplines interact (groundwater affects wetland, grading affects drainage, flood zone affects servicing). Current requirements treat disciplines as isolated silos. | Add Specification Requirement: "R-13: Interdisciplinary System Synthesis. The deliverable shall document how findings from different disciplines interact to create site-wide constraints and opportunities. Examples: (1) Geotechnical-Grading-Drainage Integration: Soil bearing capacity + site topography + drainage requirements → building placement strategy that optimizes foundation cost, grading cost, and drainage effectiveness. (2) Wetland-Servicing Integration: Wetland location + required setback + serviceability constraints → utility routing strategy that avoids wetland while maintaining service efficiency. (3) Flood-Grading Integration: Flood zone elevation + site topography → building floor elevation and grading design that ensures flood safety and minimizes earthwork cost. Verification: PM confirms that synthesis shows interdisciplinary trade-offs and optimization, not just discipline-siloed constraints." |
| E-003 | WeakStatement | Datasheet | Consequences of data flow failure not communicated | Conditions section (lines 85–86) describes information flow to downstream deliverables but does not communicate the risk: if TBDs are not resolved before downstream deliverables are finalized, concept design/pricing/schedule may be invalid. | Enhance Datasheet Conditions / Normal Operating Context: "Data Flow Risk Statement: Site conditions findings flow from this deliverable to concept design (DEL-02-01), pricing (DEL-05-03), risk register (DEL-09-01), and schedule (DEL-08-01). High-confidence findings (e.g., Addendum 03 constraints) become firm design constraints. TBD findings (e.g., geotechnical values) become assumptions with contingency allowances. If TBDs are resolved differently during detailed design than assumed in proposal, downstream deliverables may require revision. Cost and schedule contingencies in pricing and schedule reflect this TBD-resolution risk. If TBDs remain unresolved through proposal submission, design team must work within assumed ranges and maintain contingency buffers." Communicates the risk explicitly. |
| E-004 | TBD_Question | Guidance | No definition of "site understanding" for evaluators | Purpose asserts that this deliverable demonstrates "site understanding" and "credibility" (OBJ-008) but does not define what "site understanding" means operationally from an evaluator's perspective. | Question: "What constitutes demonstrated 'site understanding' in a proposal?" Propose: Define in Guidance: "Site Understanding = The proponent has (1) reviewed all available site due diligence reports, (2) identified site constraints that affect design/cost/schedule, (3) proposed specific mitigation strategies for each constraint, (4) documented assumptions and TBDs transparently, and (5) demonstrated that constraints have been incorporated into concept design, pricing, risk management, and scheduling. Evaluators assess understanding by looking for specific evidence (report citations, constraint-based decisions visible in design, cost/schedule implications quantified, cross-references between deliverables)." |
| E-005 | TBD_Question | Guidance | Evaluation committee expectations for site conditions presentation format not defined | Guidance discusses credibility and transparency but does not specify the format/presentation that evaluators expect. E.g., narrative only? tables? maps? certifications? | Question: "What presentation format does the evaluation committee expect for site conditions evidence?" Propose: Ask in PM briefing or RFP questions: "For Section 7.4 (Site Due Diligence), does the evaluation committee prefer: (a) Narrative summary in proposal text? (b) Tabular constraint summary? (c) Maps/diagrams showing constraints? (d) Professional certifications or sign-offs? (e) Cross-references to concept design, pricing, risk register?" Once format is understood, structure Proposal section accordingly and ensure all evidence is in expected format. |
| E-006 | Normalization | Multi | Climate/culture/context specific to Town of Penhold and stakeholder preferences not addressed | All guidance references generic Design-Build best practices, not Town of Penhold's specific evaluation priorities or stakeholder culture. What matters to evaluators locally may differ from general best practice. | Research Town of Penhold context: (1) Obtain previous proposals evaluated by Town (if available) to understand scoring patterns. (2) Interview Town Project Manager about Site Due Diligence priorities (what does Penhold specifically value in risk management?). (3) Check Town bylaws for site-related permitting (noise, vibration, dust, heritage, Indigenous consultation requirements). (4) Assess stakeholder risk tolerance (conservative vs. innovation-friendly). Customize Guidance to reflect Penhold-specific context rather than generic standards. E.g., if Penhold prioritizes Indigenous consultation, add explicit requirement for Indigenous liaison strategy. |
| E-007 | MissingSlot | Guidance | No explicit link between DEL-09-02 content and RFP evaluation criteria (Section 15 of decomposition) | Guidance Purpose and Principles reference OBJ-008 but do not map DEL-09-02 contributions to specific RFP evaluation point allocations. Proposal team may not understand the scoring leverage. | Add to Guidance Purpose: "Evaluation Leverage: Site conditions summary contributes to RFP scoring as follows: (1) OBJ-008 (Manage Risk Transparently) — Proposal evaluation likely includes risk management scoring (see Decomposition Section 15 for exact point allocation). Strong site conditions summary that identifies and mitigates constraints supports this score. (2) Concept Design Score (20 points) — Site constraints inform concept design decisions visible to evaluators. A design that clearly respects site constraints scores higher than a design that appears to ignore them. (3) Price Score (35 points) — Site-based cost allowances (foundation, earthwork, servicing) are credible if grounded in site conditions analysis. Price scores higher if cost drivers are visibly linked to documented site constraints. (4) Team/Delivery Score — Site understanding demonstrates project competence. Mapping these leverage points ensures the team invests appropriately in site analysis depth." |
| E-008 | VerificationGap | Datasheet | Assumption verification timeline and trigger not defined | Datasheet Assumptions (frost depth 1.8 m, Alberta Water Act permitting applicability, etc.) are labeled ASSUMPTION but no verification timeline or trigger is defined. When/how will assumptions be verified or revised? | Enhance Datasheet Assumptions: Add column "Verification Plan" for each assumption. Example: "Assumption: Frost depth 1.8 m per Alberta Building Code. Verification Plan: (1) Timeline: Immediately upon Geotechnical Report access (expected before detailed design phase). (2) Verification Method: Compare geotechnical report frost depth recommendation to assumption. (3) If matches (1.8 m ± 0.2 m): CONFIRMED, no design revision needed. (4) If differs (e.g., 2.2 m): REVISED, foundation design must deepen, cost allowance must increase, schedule may extend. (5) Responsibility: Structural engineer to flag any significant deviations and escalate to PM for cost/schedule impact. Defining verification plan up-front ensures assumptions are actively monitored, not passively forgotten." |
