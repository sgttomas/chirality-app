## Key Warnings and Blockers

### Warnings

- None. All line items fully priced from rate table evidence.

### Dependency Blockers (from Dependencies.csv -- informational only)

The following upstream dependencies are PENDING but do not block the cost estimate (cost drivers are hours x rates, independent of content resolution):

| DependencyID | Target | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-01-004 | RFP Section 7.1.6 | PENDING | Required for content drafting, not for cost estimate |
| DEP-07-01-005 | RFP Appendix A (OSR) | PENDING | Required for content tailoring, not for cost estimate |
| DEP-07-01-006 | DEL-07-02 (Key Team Members) | PENDING | Interface for content alignment |
| DEP-07-01-007 | DEL-07-03 (Appendix I) | PENDING | Interface for content alignment |
| DEP-07-01-010 | Addendum 03 | PENDING | Required for scope clarification review |

These blockers affect production readiness but not the validity of the cost estimate itself, since the estimate is driven by level-of-effort hours (already calibrated in the LOE table) and market-rate hourly pricing.

## Comparison Context

The execution-6b equivalent (EST_DEL-07-01_2026-02-18_1700) estimated the same scope under the earlier 38-deliverable decomposition (DEL-01-07 in 6b maps to DEL-07-01 in 6c). The hours and rates are expected to be comparable since the scope item (SOW-016) is unchanged between decompositions.
