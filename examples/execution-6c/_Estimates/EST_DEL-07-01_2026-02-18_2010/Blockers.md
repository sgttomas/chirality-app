## Upstream Prerequisites (Content Blockers, Not Estimate Blockers)

| DependencyID | TargetName | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-01-004 | RFP Section 7.1.6 (Firm Experience Requirements) | PENDING | NONE -- hours/rates known |
| DEP-07-01-005 | RFP Appendix A (OSR) | PENDING | NONE -- hours/rates known |
| DEP-07-01-010 | Addendum 03 | PENDING | NONE -- hours/rates known |

These documents are required before the proposal writer can draft firm experience content, but the effort estimate (16 + 4 = 20 hours) is calibrated independently of document availability.

## Upstream Interfaces (PENDING)

| DependencyID | TargetDeliverableID | TargetName | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-01-006 | DEL-07-02 | Key Team Members & Resumes | PENDING | NONE |
| DEP-07-01-007 | DEL-07-03 | Appendix I Subtrade & Consultant List | PENDING | NONE |
| DEP-07-01-008 | DEL-01-01 | Compliance Matrix & Checklist | PENDING | NONE |

These interfaces require content coordination during production but do not affect cost estimation.

| DependencyID | TargetDeliverableID | TargetName | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-01-009 | DEL-01-02 | Formal Submission Package | PENDING | DEL-07-01 must complete before handover |
