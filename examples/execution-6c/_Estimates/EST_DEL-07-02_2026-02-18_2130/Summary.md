## Key Observations

1. **Scope:** DEL-07-02 is a purely administrative deliverable focused on resume compilation, formatting, availability confirmation, and role descriptions for key team members.
2. **Cost drivers:** HR coordination (55% of cost) and proposal writing/formatting (45% of cost). Total effort is 20 hours.
3. **Confidence:** MEDIUM for both lines. Hours are parametric estimates based on comparable proposal efforts; rates are market-based.
4. **Cross-reference note:** DEL-07-02 content must be consistent with DEL-07-01 (firm experience profile) project references and feeds into DEL-07-03 (Appendix I subtrade list). Availability statements must align with DEL-08-01 (project schedule).

## Warnings and Blockers

- **Warnings:** None.
- **Blockers:** No unresolved blockers preventing meaningful estimate. Upstream dependency on DEL-07-01 (project reference data) and DEL-08-01 (schedule for availability alignment) are coordination interfaces, not pricing blockers.
