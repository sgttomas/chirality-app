## Identified Risks

| RiskID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-001 | Hourly rates may not reflect actual firm rates (MARKET basis, +/-20-30%) | Medium | Low-Medium | Rerun estimate with actual firm rates when available | ASM-001; Professional_Staff_Rates.csv Confidence=MEDIUM |
| RSK-002 | Level of effort may be understated if schedule requires unusually detailed Gantt with multiple phases, long lead procurement tracking, and extensive critical path narrative | Low-Medium | Medium | LOE range is 24-50 hours based on comparable projects; monitor actual hours during production | ASM-002; BOE context notes "higher effort than typical narrative" |
| RSK-003 | Circular dependency with DEL-04-01 may cause rework/iteration beyond the budgeted 32 hours | Low | Low | Both deliverables are T2 and produced in parallel by overlapping team; PM coordination hours (8hr) include iteration management | ASM-005; Dependencies.csv DEP-08-01-005 |
| RSK-004 | If multiple upstream deliverables (DEL-02-01, DEL-09-02) are significantly delayed, schedule production may require placeholder assumptions that need later revision, adding unbudgeted hours | Low | Low | Procedure.md for DEL-08-01 permits assumption-based content when upstream inputs are pending; revision cost would be a separate scope item | Blockers.md; Dependencies.csv |
