## Key Observations

1. **Dual-scope deliverable.** DEL-09-01 covers both SOW-026 (risk register) and SOW-027 (quality management plan). The LOE allocation includes ~4 additional PM hours for the embedded QMP scope per the Level_of_Effort.csv notes.

2. **Quality Lead role.** R-23 (Quality Lead, 8 hours) is allocated specifically for the SOW-027 QMP component -- design QC, construction QC, and documentation QC procedures.

3. **PM-heavy cost profile.** The Project Manager (R-02) accounts for 51.3% of the deliverable cost, reflecting the PM's role as risk identification lead and cross-deliverable consistency coordinator.

4. **No blockers identified.** All upstream document prerequisites (RFP, addenda, technical reports) are reference documents that do not block the production cost estimate.
