| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hourly rates for R-02 ($175/hr) and R-03 ($165/hr) are representative of Alberta 2024 market rates for DB firm management roles | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM) | +/-20-30% on total estimate ($2,350). If actual firm rates differ, rerun with updated rate table. |
| ASM-002 | Level of effort (R-03: 10 hrs, R-02: 4 hrs) is appropriate for a design methodology narrative on a $15-20M municipal DB project proposal | Level_of_Effort.csv (Basis=PARAMETRIC, Confidence=MEDIUM); LOE notes state same scope as 6b DEL-06-01 | +/-20-30% on total estimate. If scope is more complex than typical, hours may increase. |
| ASM-003 | DEL-03-01 scope is limited to design methodology narrative (process, engagement, innovation/value, approvals, controls) per SOW-008; does NOT include design QC narrative (DEL-03-02) or construction quality management (DEL-09-01) | Decomposition Section 8 DEL-03-01 definition; BOE context in brief | If scope boundary shifts, hours and roles may need adjustment. |
| ASM-004 | No additional roles (e.g., specialist consultants, proposal coordinators) are required for this deliverable | Level_of_Effort.csv lists only R-02 and R-03 for DEL-03-01 | If additional contributors are needed, new line items required. |
