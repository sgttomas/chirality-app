## Run Identity

- **RunID:** EST_DEL-03-01_2026-02-18_1400
- **Basis of Estimate:** RATE_TABLE
- **Currency:** CAD
- **Rounding:** DOLLAR

## BasisOfEstimate_Used

Method: RATE_TABLE. All line items priced as `Hours x Hourly Rate` using Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (market rates) and Level_of_Effort.csv (planning hour estimates). No fallback methods used. No mixed methods.

## Totals by Deliverable

| WBS_PackageID | WBS_DeliverableID | Deliverable Name | Total (CAD) | Lines | Hours |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| PKG-05 | DEL-03-01 | Design Methodology Narrative | $2,350 | 2 | 14 |

## Totals by CBS

## Line Detail

| Line | Role | Hours | Rate (CAD/hr) | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| L-01 | Design Manager (R-03) | 10 | $165 | $1,650 |
| L-02 | Project Manager (R-02) | 4 | $175 | $700 |

## Key Observations

1. DEL-03-01 is a management-authored narrative deliverable. The cost is driven entirely by senior management hours (Design Manager lead, PM review).
2. The Level_of_Effort source notes that DEL-03-01 scope is equivalent to execution-6b DEL-06-01, confirming consistency across decomposition variants.
3. No construction pricing, specialty consulting, or production drawing effort applies to this deliverable.
4. Cost ownership boundary confirmed: design methodology narrative (process, engagement, innovation) belongs to DEL-03-01; design QC narrative belongs to DEL-03-02; quality management plan for construction QC is in DEL-09-01.

## Warnings and Blockers

- **Warnings:** None
- **Blockers:** None identified. All upstream execution dependencies (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-08-01) are coordination/sequencing dependencies, not pricing-input dependencies. The estimate does not depend on their completion.
