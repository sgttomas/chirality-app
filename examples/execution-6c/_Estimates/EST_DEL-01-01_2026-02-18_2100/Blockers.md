### Upstream Prerequisites (Document-type)

All upstream document prerequisites are available:

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status |

### Upstream Interfaces (Deliverable-type)

These are status-tracking interfaces, not pricing inputs:

| DependencyID | Target | Nature | Impact on Estimating |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-01-01-023 | DEL-01-03 (Bonding & Insurance) | Compliance matrix tracks Agreement to Bond status | No pricing impact |
| DEP-01-01-024 | DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission) | Compliance matrix tracks Appendix G status | No pricing impact |

### Downstream Dependencies

DEL-01-01 is a gate for DEL-01-02 (proposal assembly cannot commence until compliance matrix is signed off). This is an execution sequencing dependency, not an estimating blocker.

## Conclusion

All inputs required for estimating DEL-01-01 are available. No blockers.
