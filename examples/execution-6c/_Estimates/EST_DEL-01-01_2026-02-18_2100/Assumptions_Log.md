| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Proposal Coordinator hourly rate is $105 CAD | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (R-22); Basis = MARKET; Confidence = MEDIUM | Direct pricing input. If actual firm rate differs, the estimate changes proportionally. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-002 | Level of effort for DEL-01-01 is 8 hours of Proposal Coordinator time | Level_of_Effort.csv (DEL-01-01 row); Basis = PARAMETRIC | Direct quantity input. The 8-hour estimate is a planning estimate based on comparable proposal efforts for $15-20M municipal DB projects. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-003 | DEL-01-01 scope is limited to compliance matrix and addenda checklist production; it does not include hours for tracking downstream deliverable completion status during proposal production | Decomposition Section 8 DEL-01-01 definition; BOE Context provided in brief | If ongoing compliance tracking during proposal production is intended, additional hours may be needed. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-004 | No additional roles contribute to DEL-01-01 beyond R-22 (Proposal Coordinator / Writer) | Level_of_Effort.csv (only 1 row for DEL-01-01) | If Project Manager review time is expected (e.g., for sign-off per DEP-01-01-005 prerequisite gate), the estimate would increase. | MEDIUM |
