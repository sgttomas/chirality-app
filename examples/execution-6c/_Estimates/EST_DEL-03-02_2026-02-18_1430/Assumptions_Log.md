## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-01 | Professional hourly rates are internal Design-Build rates (not external consultant fees) | BOE Section 8 (A-01); Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (Basis=MARKET) | If external consultants used, rates may be higher |
| ASM-02 | Level of effort (10h Design Manager + 4h PM) is appropriate for a Tier 3 narrative plan document | Level_of_Effort.csv (Basis=PARAMETRIC); BOE Section 4 (PKG-05) notes LOE equivalent to 6b DEL-06-02 | If document scope is larger than anticipated (e.g., extensive QA/QC detail required), hours may be underestimated |
| ASM-03 | No specialty consulting or production drawing effort required for this deliverable | BOE Section 4 (PKG-05 characterization: "Design manager hours; discipline deliverables, QA/QC checkpoints, review cycles, coordination approach") | If the plan requires input from discipline leads beyond what the Design Manager can provide, additional hours would be needed |
| ASM-04 | Upstream execution dependencies (DEL-03-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-07-03) do not affect production-cost estimates | BOE run strategy: production cost is independent of upstream deliverable completion status | If coordination rework is needed due to late upstream deliverables, additional hours may be required |
| ASM-05 | Base year 2024 rates; no escalation applied | BOE Section 8 (A-08) | If preparation extends significantly, rates may escalate |
