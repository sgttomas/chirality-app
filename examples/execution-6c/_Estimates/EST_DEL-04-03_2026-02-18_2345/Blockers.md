# Blocker Report — EST_DEL-04-03_2026-02-18_2345

## Summary

**No blockers prevent meaningful estimation of DEL-04-03.**

All pricing sources (hourly rates and level-of-effort hours) are available and sufficient. Upstream interface dependencies are PENDING but affect deliverable content only, not production cost.

## Dependency-Derived Observations

| DependencyID | Type | Target | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|--------------|------|--------|--------|--------------------|
| DEP-04-03-005 | PREREQUISITE | RFP Section 7.3.4 | PENDING (PDF not accessible) | LOW -- communications requirements inferred from decomposition; production effort stable regardless |
| DEP-04-03-006 | INTERFACE | DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology) | PENDING | NONE -- interface affects content alignment, not production hours |
| DEP-04-03-007 | INTERFACE | DEL-04-02 (Budget Control) | PENDING | NONE -- interface affects content alignment, not production hours |
| DEP-04-03-008 | INTERFACE | DEL-03-01 (Design Methodology) | PENDING | NONE -- interface affects content alignment, not production hours |

## Downstream Implications

| DependencyID | Type | Target | Notes |
|--------------|------|--------|-------|
| DEP-04-03-009 | INTERFACE | DEL-06-01 (Commissioning Narrative) | DEL-04-03 is authoritative source for commissioning communication protocols; DEL-06-01 estimate should not duplicate this scope |
| DEP-04-03-010 | HANDOVER | DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission) | Final assembly dependency; no cost impact on DEL-04-03 |
