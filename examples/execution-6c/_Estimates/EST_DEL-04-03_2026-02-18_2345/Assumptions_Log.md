| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|--------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| ASM-001 | Professional hourly rates are internal DB firm rates (not external consultant fees) | BOE A-01; Professional_Staff_Rates.csv basis=MARKET | If external consultants used, PM rate could be $200-250/hr and CM rate $175-200/hr; estimate could increase by 20-40% |
| ASM-002 | Level of effort (10 hours total) is adequate for a T3 narrative deliverable covering communications plan + reporting cadence + subconsultant approach | BOE A-02; Level_of_Effort.csv basis=PARAMETRIC | If scope requires more stakeholder complexity or the communications plan requires more detail than typical, hours could increase to 12-16h; estimate could increase by 20-60% |
| ASM-003 | No coordination overhead beyond the hours allocated | Implicit in LOE allocation | If significant iteration with DEL-04-01/DEL-04-02/DEL-03-01 teams is required for interface alignment, additional 2-4 hours of PM time could be needed |
| ASM-004 | RFP Section 7.3.4 communications requirements are standard and do not require unusual effort | BOE context; RFP PDF not accessible | If RFP 7.3.4 contains non-standard requirements, scope could expand; low probability given municipal DB project context |
| ASM-005 | Base year 2024 rates; no escalation applied | BOE A-08 | If preparation extends into 2025+, rates may escalate; minor impact on $1,670 total |
