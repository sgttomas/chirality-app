## Basis of Estimate Summary

This is a **proposal production cost estimate** for the Communications & Reporting Plan deliverable. The estimate covers professional staff hours to draft the communications plan narrative, including meeting structures, reporting cadence, stakeholder touchpoints, and subconsultant approach content (SOW-021).

**Method:** RATE_TABLE -- hours from Level_of_Effort.csv multiplied by hourly rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv.

**Cost drivers:**
- PM hours (6h): primary author; defines meeting structure, frequency, reporting cadence, stakeholder engagement protocol, subconsultant management approach
- Construction Manager hours (4h): provides construction-phase communications input, site meeting structure, field reporting requirements

**Cost ownership boundaries (per BOE):**
- Communications + reporting protocol: DEL-04-03 (this estimate)
- Construction methodology content: DEL-04-01 (NOT here)
- Subconsultant APPROACH: DEL-04-03 (this estimate); subtrade LIST: DEL-07-03 (NOT here)

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers prevent meaningful estimation.** All pricing sources are available and sufficient.
- DEP-04-03-005: RFP Section 7.3.4 PDF not accessible; communications requirements inferred from decomposition. Low risk to estimate accuracy since the effort to produce the plan is largely independent of the specific RFP content.
- Upstream interface dependencies (DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, DEL-03-01) are PENDING but do not block the production cost estimate -- the hours to write a communications plan are relatively stable regardless of the specific methodology/budget content referenced.
