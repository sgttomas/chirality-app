# Blockers Report: EST_DEL-05-02_2026-02-18_1500

## Active Blockers: NONE

No active blockers prevented estimate production for DEL-05-02.

## Dependency Assessment

| DependencyID | Target | Class | Impact on Estimating | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-02-004 | DEL-02-01 (Concept Design) | PREREQUISITE | Provides GFA/massing for quantity derivation | Used Assumed_Project_Parameters.csv (PP-05: 18000 sf) as proxy. Not a blocker for estimating -- quantities are parametric. Will need refinement when concept is available. |
| DEP-05-02-005 | DEL-05-01 (Schedule A) | INTERFACE | Reconciliation target | Schedule A estimate (EST_DEL-05-01_2026-02-18_1400) is available. All CBS totals reconcile exactly. |
| DEP-05-02-007 | DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative) | INTERFACE | Assumption consistency | Parallel development dependency. Assumptions documented in Assumptions_Log.md for cross-check with DEL-05-03 when produced. |
| DEP-05-02-010 | RFP Appendix H template | PREREQUISITE | Schedule B form structure | Template format assumed from decomposition description. Not a blocker for cost estimating -- form layout affects presentation, not pricing. |
| DEP-05-02-011 | Addendum 03 | CONSTRAINT | Scope changes | Fully reflected: pickled sand removed; 12-acre site; FF&E as Option 6. |

## Potential Future Blockers (informational)

| Issue | Deliverable Impact | Current Status |
|---|---|---|
| OI-004 FF&E treatment | Option 6 pricing | OPEN -- estimated as $20k allowance per BOE recommendation |
| Vendor quotes not obtained | All construction content lines | INFORMATIONAL -- parametric pricing is appropriate for proposal stage; quotes needed before final pricing |
| Concept design not available | Quantity refinement | INFORMATIONAL -- PP-05/PP-07 parameters sufficient for parametric estimate |
