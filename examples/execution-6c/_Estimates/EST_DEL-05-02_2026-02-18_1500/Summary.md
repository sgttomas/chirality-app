**All construction pricing content lines reconcile exactly to Schedule A (DEL-05-01).**

Production costs differ between Schedule A ($9,960 / 72 hrs) and Schedule B ($6,020 / 44 hrs) because they represent different production efforts: Schedule A requires pricing strategy, margin decisions, and assembly; Schedule B requires detailed quantity takeoff, line-item verification, and CBS allocation.

## Key Observations

1. **Schedule B provides significantly more detail than Schedule A**: 73 priced lines in Schedule B vs 24 in Schedule A. The additional granularity allows cost tracking by sub-system (e.g., HVAC split into office HVAC, bay heating, plumbing, fire protection, exhaust extraction, breathing air, etc.).

2. **Full reconciliation achieved**: Every CBS category in Schedule B sums exactly to the corresponding Schedule A line item. This is a mandatory acceptance criterion per Specification.md R-005.

3. **GR breakdown exposes cost structure**: The $1,305,000 General Requirements allocation is broken into 8 sub-lines (project management, site supervision, temporary facilities, mobilization, miscellaneous/contingency, health and safety, QC/testing, cleanup) providing transparency on the 15% GR factor.

4. **Design fee markup visible**: The $780,000 design fee line is broken into discipline-specific fees ($375k from percentage calculations) plus a $405k DB firm markup adjustment. This shows the gap between standard engineering fee percentages and the DB firm's actual design services charge.

5. **Underground utility contingency added**: Schedule B includes $64,500 in utility contingency within the UG CBS to reconcile to the $350,000 Schedule A target. This accounts for unforeseen conditions during utility installation.

6. **Options fully detailed**: Each Additional Option is broken into component costs (e.g., Wash Bay = system + plumbing mods + environmental compliance = $123k).

7. **Equipment lines include transparency rows**: L-095 and L-096 (temporary facilities and temp power) are shown for transparency but are NOT additive to the base total -- they are part of the GR breakdown and are marked as such.

8. **OI-004 (FF&E) resolved**: $20,000 cash allowance carried as Additional Option 6 per BOE recommendation.

## Key Warnings and Blockers

### Warnings

1. **W-001**: All construction pricing content is PARAMETRIC (no vendor quotes). Accuracy is +/-20-50% depending on line item.
2. **W-002**: Design fee markup adjustment ($405k in L-108) is a reconciliation line to match Schedule A -- the underlying discipline-specific fee calculations ($375k) may be more accurate than the 9% blended rate.
3. **W-003**: Bond/insurance rates (5.45% combined) are market estimates. Actual surety and insurance quotes should be obtained.
4. **W-004**: Underground utility contingency ($64.5k in L-078) is a reconciliation allocation -- actual unforeseen conditions may be higher or lower.
5. **W-005**: OI-004 (FF&E) is implemented as recommended ($20k allowance) but is still formally OPEN per decomposition status.
6. **W-006**: GR L-095 and L-096 are transparency-only lines (not additive to base total). Users must exclude these when summing Detail.csv to avoid double-counting.
7. **W-007**: Cold storage building (L-080) is priced as a turnkey PEMB. Some sub-elements (electrical, ventilation) also appear in the ELEC and MECH CBS rollups within L-059. The L-080 cold storage line represents the turnkey complete cost; discipline-specific allocations in L-059 account for the electrical portion that was split out for CBS traceability.

### Blockers

- **No blockers** for estimate production. All pricing sources available; all dependencies resolved for estimating purposes.
