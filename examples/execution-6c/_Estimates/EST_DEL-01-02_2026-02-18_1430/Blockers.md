## Blocker Assessment

DEL-01-02 is the TERMINAL deliverable in this decomposition (Tier 5). It depends on all 20 other deliverables reaching Final maturity. All 20 are currently PENDING.

**However, this does not block estimating.** The production cost to assemble, QA, and submit the final PDF is a function of the number of deliverables being assembled and the complexity of the assembly process -- not a function of the content itself. The Level_of_Effort.csv already accounts for the 21-deliverable consolidated structure (noting "slightly fewer deliverables to assemble than 6b (21 vs 38)").
