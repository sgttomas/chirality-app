| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|-------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| ASM-001 | Proposal Coordinator hourly rate is $105 CAD (2024 market rate) | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv#R-22; Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM | If actual rate differs, L-01 amount changes proportionally. +/-20-30% range = $1,029-$1,911 for L-01. |
| ASM-002 | Project Manager hourly rate is $175 CAD (2024 market rate) | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv#R-02; Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM | If actual rate differs, L-02 amount changes proportionally. +/-20-30% range = $490-$910 for L-02. |
| ASM-003 | Proposal Coordinator requires 14 hours for final PDF assembly | Level_of_Effort.csv#DEL-01-02/R-22; Basis=PARAMETRIC | Note: 6c has 21 deliverables vs 6b's 38 -- LOE notes "slightly fewer" hours needed. If actual effort differs, total changes proportionally. |
| ASM-004 | Project Manager requires 4 hours for final review and sign-off | Level_of_Effort.csv#DEL-01-02/R-02; Basis=PARAMETRIC | Standard review/sign-off effort. Low risk of material variance. |
| ASM-005 | Digital-only submission (email PDF <15MB) per RFP 4.2/5.3 | BOE Assumption A-06; RFP Sections 4.2, 5.3 | If physical copies required, additional production cost (printing, binding, courier). Not expected based on RFP. |
| ASM-006 | No Intent to Propose (Appendix C) submitted | BOE Assumption A-05 (OI-001 recommended resolution) | If submitted, add ~1-2 hours of Proposal Coordinator time (~$105-$210). Minimal impact. |
| ASM-007 | All upstream deliverables will be available in Final maturity for assembly | Decomposition Tier 5 requirement; BOE Section 5 | If any upstream deliverable is incomplete at assembly time, DEL-01-02 cannot complete. This is an execution risk, not an estimating risk. |
| ASM-008 | No escalation applied to 2024 base year rates | BOE Assumption A-08 | If preparation extends significantly beyond 2024, rates may need escalation adjustment. |
