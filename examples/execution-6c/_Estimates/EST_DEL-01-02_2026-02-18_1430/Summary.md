## Scope and Cost Ownership

DEL-01-02 covers the **final PDF assembly and submission logistics** for the Penhold PSB proposal. This is a pure administrative/production deliverable -- assembling all 20 other deliverables into the final submission package.

**Cost ownership (per BOE):**
- Final PDF assembly + submission logistics: **DEL-01-02** (this estimate)
- Compliance checking + addenda tracking: DEL-01-01 (not in this estimate)
- All content production: in respective deliverables (not in this estimate)

---

## Key Warnings and Blockers

1. **TERMINAL DELIVERABLE (Tier 5):** DEL-01-02 depends on all 20 other deliverables reaching Final maturity before assembly can begin. All 20 upstream prerequisites are currently PENDING.

2. **Submission Deadline Constraint:** Hard deadline Aug 30 2024 @ 2:00 PM MST. DEL-01-02 must be the last activity in the proposal production sequence.

3. **No blockers to estimating:** All pricing inputs (hourly rates + level of effort) are available. The estimate is complete and meaningful despite the upstream deliverable dependencies being unresolved (because the production hours to assemble the package are independent of the content being assembled).

## Basis of Estimate Summary

- **Method:** RATE_TABLE -- hours multiplied by hourly rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv
- **Hours Source:** Level_of_Effort.csv (parametric planning estimates for consolidated proposal effort)
- **Rate Confidence:** MEDIUM (parametric Alberta 2024 market rates; +/-20-30%)
- **Hour Confidence:** MEDIUM (based on comparable proposal efforts for $15-20M municipal DB projects; 21 deliverables to assemble vs 38 in execution-6b, hence slightly fewer hours)
