## Estimate Blockers

**None.** No dependencies block the cost estimate. All line items are priced from rate table sources (hours x rates) which are independent of upstream document availability.

## Execution Readiness Blockers (informational; do not affect estimate pricing)

The following upstream prerequisite documents have SatisfactionStatus=PENDING. These are required for the deliverable team to **execute** the concept design work, but do not change the estimated cost:

| DependencyID | Target | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-DEL-02-01-006 | RFP Appendix B (Functional Program) | PENDING | None — hours and rates fixed |
| DEP-DEL-02-01-007 | RFP Appendix A (Owner Statement of Requirements) | PENDING | None — hours and rates fixed |
| DEP-DEL-02-01-008 | Addendum 03 | PENDING | None — hours and rates fixed |
| DEP-DEL-02-01-009 | Geotechnical Investigation Report | PENDING | None — hours and rates fixed |
| DEP-DEL-02-01-010 | Wetland Assessment | PENDING | None — hours and rates fixed |
| DEP-DEL-02-01-011 | Flood Zone Mapping | PENDING | None — hours and rates fixed |

## Downstream Interfaces (informational)

DEL-02-01 outputs feed:
- DEL-02-02 (Design Brief Narrative) — concept establishes design foundation for narrative
- DEL-02-03 (Sustainability & Energy Narrative) — roof form/orientation/envelope consumed
- PKG-02 (Financial Proposal) — concept scope informs cost estimates
- DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission Package) — concept package integrated into proposal PDF
