## Cost Driver Analysis

1. **Architectural design (DESIGN-ARCH)** is the largest cost block at $9,260 (31.3%), reflecting the lead architect's 44-hour concept design effort plus 24 hours of intermediate support.
2. **CAD/BIM production (PRODUCTION-CAD)** is the second largest at $6,080 (20.5%), consistent with DEL-02-01 being the highest-effort drawing deliverable. The 64 hours of R-06 time includes floor plans, elevations, sections, and site concept drawings. CAD/BIM software costs are embedded in the $95/hr rate per PS-10.
3. **Civil engineering (DESIGN-CIVIL)** at $4,600 (15.5%) reflects the 12-acre site plan, parking layout, and grading concept — elevated due to the consolidated package embedding civil/site work that was separate in execution-6b.
4. **Engineering disciplines (STRUCT + MECH + ELEC)** together total $7,920 (26.8%), representing concept-level input from structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers.
5. **PM coordination** at $1,750 (5.9%) covers cross-discipline coordination overhead for the consolidated concept package.

## Key Observations

- DEL-02-01 is the **highest-effort design deliverable** in this decomposition (228 hours across 12 roles).
- All costs are **proposal production costs** (professional staff time to produce the concept design package for the RFP response). These are NOT construction costs.
- The optional 3D rendering (16-24 hours of R-06 time) is NOT included. Per BOE context, this would add $1,520-$2,280 if elected.
- No blockers identified that would prevent estimating. Six upstream prerequisite documents are PENDING access but do not affect the rate-based estimate.

## Warnings and Blockers

- **No pricing warnings.** All 12 lines priced from rate table sources with 100% provenance.
- **Dependency note:** 6 upstream prerequisite documents (RFP Appendix A, Appendix B, Addendum 03, Geotechnical Report, Wetland Assessment, Flood Zone Mapping) have SatisfactionStatus=PENDING. These affect deliverable execution readiness but do not impact the cost estimate (hours and rates are independent of document availability).
