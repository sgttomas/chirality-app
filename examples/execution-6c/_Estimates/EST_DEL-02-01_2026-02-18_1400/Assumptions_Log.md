# Assumptions Log — EST_DEL-02-01_2026-02-18_1400

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Professional staff hourly rates reflect Alberta 2024 market rates for a Design-Build firm | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM) | If actual firm rates differ by +/-20-30%, total estimate shifts proportionally; $29,610 could range $20,727-$38,493 |
| ASM-002 | Level of effort hours (228h total) are appropriate for a consolidated concept design package covering floor plans, elevations, sections, and 12-acre site concept | Level_of_Effort.csv (Basis=PARAMETRIC, Confidence per INDEX.md = +/-20-30%) | If actual effort is higher (e.g., complex Addendum 03 integration), cost increases; +30% would be $38,493 |
| ASM-003 | CAD/BIM software costs are fully embedded in R-06 hourly rate ($95/hr) | INDEX.md PS-10 | If separate software licensing is required, an additional line item would be needed |
| ASM-004 | 3D rendering is NOT included in the estimate | BOE context: "Optional 3D rendering = 16-24 hours of R-06 time" | If rendering is elected, add $1,520-$2,280 (16-24h x $95/hr) |
| ASM-005 | The consolidated DEL-02-01 in execution-6c includes civil/site concept work that was split across multiple deliverables in execution-6b | Level_of_Effort.csv Notes: "slightly more than 6b DEL-02-01 due to embedded civil/site" | Consolidation may create coordination overhead not fully captured in LOE hours |
| ASM-006 | No premium for schedule compression or overtime is included | No source evidence for premium rates | If proposal timeline (PP-04: 6 weeks) forces compressed design effort, actual costs could be higher |
| ASM-007 | One concept option is being developed (not multiple competing options) | Implied by single LOE allocation | Multiple concept options would multiply architectural and CAD hours |
