# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-04-02_2026-02-18_2400

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are representative of Alberta 2024 market rates for a Design-Build firm | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv header: "MARKET" basis, "MEDIUM" confidence. | Total could shift +/-$400 to $600 depending on rate variance direction (+/-30%). |
| ASM-002 | Level-of-effort hours (8h PM + 4h CM) are adequate for the budget control and change management plan scope | Level_of_Effort.csv: "PARAMETRIC" basis; notes state "Cost reporting; change management; contingency approach" for PM and "Budget control input" for CM. | If scope is larger than assumed, additional hours would increase cost proportionally. At +30%, total would be ~$2,626. |
| ASM-003 | No additional roles are required beyond Project Manager and Construction Manager for this deliverable | Level_of_Effort.csv lists only R-02 and R-15 for DEL-04-02. No estimator (R-18/R-19) separately allocated even though plan references cost/budget content. | If an estimator review is separately charged, add ~2-4h at $145/hr = $290-$580 additional. |
| ASM-004 | This deliverable is purely a proposal production cost (narrative authorship) with no embedded construction pricing | Decomposition Section 8: output is "Budget control plan including change management workflow and cost reporting." BOE context confirms: "budget control METHODOLOGY doesn't require knowing the actual numbers." | Correct per decomposition. No construction pricing content expected. |
| ASM-005 | The heavy upstream dependency network (7 deliverables + 2 document constraints) does not increase production effort beyond the LOE allocation | BOE context confirms that production hours can be estimated independently of dependency resolution. Procedure permits placeholders for unresolved upstream content. | If dependency coordination proves more complex than assumed, hours could increase. Impact estimated at +2-4h PM ($350-$700). |
