## Cost Drivers

- **Primary cost driver:** Project Manager hours (69% of total). The PM is the primary author of the budget control and change management plan, covering cost reporting structure, change management workflow, contingency approach, and integration with schedule/risk/pricing deliverables.
- **Secondary cost driver:** Construction Manager input (31% of total). The CM provides construction-phase budget control context and review input to ensure the plan aligns with construction methodology (DEL-04-01).

## Key Observations

1. DEL-04-02 is a **pure proposal production cost** -- no construction pricing content is embedded in this deliverable. The plan describes HOW budget control and change management will work, not WHAT the budget numbers are.
2. Despite heavy upstream dependencies (7 deliverable prerequisites/interfaces + 2 document constraints), the cost estimate is independent of those inputs. The production hours to write the budget control methodology are driven by the scope of the plan, not by the actual budget numbers.
3. The PM is the primary author (8 hours, 67% of effort) reflecting this deliverable's character as a management/administrative plan rather than a technical construction document.
4. Cost ownership boundaries are respected: construction methodology details (SOW-019) are in DEL-04-01; pricing assumptions are in DEL-05-03; communications/reporting protocol is in DEL-04-03.
5. The 12-hour total (8h PM + 4h CM) is consistent with the T3 narrative deliverable character -- comparable to DEL-04-03 (Communications & Reporting Plan, 10 hours) and lower than DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology, 18 hours) which covers two SOW items including a larger technical scope.

## Warnings

- None.

## Blockers (from dependency evidence)

- **Execution blockers for the deliverable itself** (not for estimating):
  - DEL-05-01 (Schedule A Pricing Summary) -- PREREQUISITE, PENDING
  - DEL-05-02 (Schedule B Cost Breakdown) -- PREREQUISITE, PENDING
  - DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions) -- PREREQUISITE, PENDING
  - DEL-04-03 (Communications and Reporting Plan) -- INTERFACE, PENDING
  - DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) -- INTERFACE, PENDING
  - DEL-09-01 (Risk Register and Mitigation Plan) -- INTERFACE, PENDING
  - DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative) -- INTERFACE, PENDING
- These do not block estimating because the cost estimate is based on staff effort allocation (hours x rates), which is independent of upstream content availability.
