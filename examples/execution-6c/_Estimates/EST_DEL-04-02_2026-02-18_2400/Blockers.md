# Blocker Report -- DEL-04-02 Budget Control & Change Management Plan

## Estimating Blockers

**None.** All pricing inputs (staff rates + level of effort hours) are available and sufficient for a complete estimate.

## Deliverable Execution Blockers (informational)

These upstream dependencies are PENDING and would affect finalization of the deliverable content itself, but they do NOT block estimating because the cost estimate is based on staff effort allocation (hours x rates), which is independent of upstream content.

### Prerequisites (gate plan section completion)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-04-02-E001 | DEL-05-01 (Schedule A Pricing Summary) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None -- hours are allocated regardless of pricing availability. Plan budget baseline section requires Schedule A totals but this affects content, not production cost. |
| DEP-04-02-E002 | DEL-05-02 (Schedule B Cost Breakdown) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None -- hours are allocated regardless of cost code structure availability. Plan cost code structure requires Schedule B alignment but this affects content, not production cost. |
| DEP-04-02-E003 | DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None -- hours are allocated regardless of pricing narrative availability. Change pricing methodology alignment affects content, not production cost. |

### Interfaces (plan must describe integration)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-04-02-E004 | DEL-04-03 (Communications and Reporting Plan) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None -- reporting cadence coordination affects content, not production cost. |
| DEP-04-02-E005 | DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None -- schedule integration context affects content, not production cost. |
| DEP-04-02-E006 | DEL-09-01 (Risk Register and Mitigation Plan) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None -- contingency allocation strategy affects content, not production cost. |
| DEP-04-02-E007 | DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None -- construction approach context affects content, not production cost. |

### Constraints (governing documents)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-04-02-E009 | RFP Section 7 | CONSTRAINT | PENDING | None -- compliance constraint affects content, not cost. |
| DEP-04-02-E010 | Addendum 03 | CONSTRAINT | PENDING | None -- scope clarifications affect content, not cost. |
