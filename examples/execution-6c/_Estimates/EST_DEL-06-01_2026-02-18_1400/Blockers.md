# Blocker Report — EST_DEL-06-01_2026-02-18_1400

## Estimation Blockers

**None.** All pricing inputs are available and sufficient for a RATE_TABLE estimate.

## Production Blockers (informational; do not block estimation)

The following upstream dependencies are PENDING (deliverable not yet complete) per Dependencies.csv. These would block actual production of DEL-06-01 but do NOT affect the cost estimate.

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Impact on Estimation |
|--------------|--------|------|--------|---------------------|
| DEP-06-01-007 | DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None — production hours independent of compliance matrix availability |
| DEP-06-01-008 | DEL-08-01 (Project Schedule) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — commissioning milestone alignment is a production concern, not a cost driver |
| DEP-06-01-009 | DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — construction sequencing integration is a production concern |
| DEP-06-01-010 | DEL-07-02 (Key Team Resumes) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — Cx lead credentials are a production concern |
| DEP-06-01-011 | DEL-03-01 (Design Methodology) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — design-phase Cx planning is a production concern |
| DEP-06-01-012 | DEL-03-02 (Design Docs Plan) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — documentation plan alignment is a production concern |
| DEP-06-01-013 | DEL-09-01 (Risk Register) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — Cx-related risk alignment is a production concern |
| DEP-06-01-014 | Addendum 03 PDF | PREREQUISITE | TBD | None — technical requirements from Addendum 03 are known from decomposition context |
