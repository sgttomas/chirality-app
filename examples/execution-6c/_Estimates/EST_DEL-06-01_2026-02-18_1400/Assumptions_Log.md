# Assumptions Log — EST_DEL-06-01_2026-02-18_1400

## Assumptions Inherited from BOE

| ID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|----|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| A-01 | Professional hourly rates are internal DB rates (not external consultant fees) | BOE §8, A-01 | If Commissioning Lead is external, rate may be higher than $140/hr |
| A-02 | Consolidated deliverables require multi-discipline coordination overhead beyond sum-of-parts | BOE §8, A-02 | If underestimated, DEL-06-01 may exceed 22 hours; however, this deliverable is primarily single-author (Cx Lead) with PM input rather than multi-discipline like DEL-02-02 |
| A-08 | Base year 2024; no escalation applied | BOE §8, A-08 | If proposal preparation extends beyond 2024, rates may need escalation |

## Run-Specific Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|----|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| RA-001 | Commissioning Lead (R-21) at $140/hr is the applicable rate for authoring the commissioning/training/closeout/deficiencies/warranty narrative | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv R-21; Confidence=MEDIUM | Rate is a market estimate; actual internal rate may differ by +/-20-30% |
| RA-002 | 16 hours for Commissioning Lead is sufficient to cover all 5 sub-topics (commissioning approach, training documentation, O&M manuals/as-built process, deficiencies management, warranty) | Level_of_Effort.csv DEL-06-01/R-21; LOE notes: "more than any single 6b DEL-08-xx" | If commissioning narrative requires more depth (e.g., detailed commissioning checklists, extensive training plan), hours may increase |
| RA-003 | 6 hours PM is sufficient for coordination across 7 upstream interface deliverables | Level_of_Effort.csv DEL-06-01/R-02 | Heavy interface network (DEL-08-01, DEL-04-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-03-01, DEL-03-02, DEL-09-01, DEL-01-01) may require more PM time if upstream deliverables have significant gaps or conflicts |
| RA-004 | No additional roles required beyond Commissioning Lead and PM | Level_of_Effort.csv (only 2 rows for DEL-06-01) | If mechanical/electrical engineers need to review commissioning protocols for their systems, additional hours may be needed — but such input is expected to be captured in upstream deliverable estimates |
