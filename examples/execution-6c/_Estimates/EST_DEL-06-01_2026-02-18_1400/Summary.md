## Key Observations

1. **Consolidated deliverable:** DEL-06-01 covers the full scope of SOW-022 (commissioning, training, closeout, deficiencies management, and warranty) in a single narrative. This is a T3 deliverable with 7 upstream interface dependencies.

2. **Effort concentration:** 73% of hours (16 of 22) are allocated to the Commissioning Lead, reflecting the specialist-intensive nature of commissioning/closeout/warranty narrative writing. PM hours (6) cover cross-deliverable coordination.

3. **Upstream dependency network:** DEL-06-01 interfaces with DEL-08-01 (schedule), DEL-04-01 (construction methodology), DEL-07-02 (team resumes), DEL-03-01 (design methodology), DEL-03-02 (docs plan), DEL-09-01 (risk register), and DEL-01-01 (compliance matrix). This is one of the most interface-heavy deliverables in the decomposition.

4. **No blockers for estimation:** All production hours are estimable from rate table + LOE sources. Upstream deliverable completion status does not block the cost estimate (it would block actual production).
