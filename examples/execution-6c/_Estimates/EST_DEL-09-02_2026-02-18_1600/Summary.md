## Key Warnings and Blockers

### Warnings

- None. All line items are fully priced with rate table evidence.

### Blockers (from Dependency Register)

The dependency register for DEL-09-02 identifies **6 upstream prerequisite documents** that are currently PENDING (reference reports are inaccessible due to PDF read errors). These are:

1. **REF-GEOTECH** -- Geotechnical Investigation Report (BLOCKING)
2. **REF-WETLAND** -- Wetland Assessment Report (BLOCKING)
3. **REF-GRADING** -- Site Grading Document (BLOCKING)
4. **REF-FLOODZONE** -- Flood Zone Mapping (BLOCKING)
5. **REF-ENVIRO** -- Desktop Environmental Assessment (IMPORTANT)
6. **REF-ADJSUBDIV** -- Adjacent Subdivision Design (IMPORTANT)

These blockers affect the **content quality** of the deliverable (ability to extract and summarize actual site conditions) but do **not** affect the **proposal production cost estimate**. The hours and rates needed to produce this deliverable are known regardless of whether the reference reports have been read yet.

Additionally, 1 upstream interface (DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative) is PENDING for the construction phase constraints section (Specification R-14).
