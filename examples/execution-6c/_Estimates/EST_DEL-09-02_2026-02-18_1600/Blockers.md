## Content Blockers (Do Not Affect Production Cost Estimate)

These dependencies are PENDING and affect the ability to write the deliverable content with full data. They do not affect the proposal production cost estimate because hours and rates are defined independently of report accessibility.

## Root Cause

All 6 reference report documents are currently inaccessible due to PDF read errors (per Datasheet.md B-003). PM action is required to obtain readable copies of these source PDFs.

## Impact Assessment

- **Production cost estimate:** Not affected. The estimate of $2,950 CAD for 18 hours of professional effort is valid regardless of report accessibility.
- **Deliverable content quality:** Materially affected. Without the reference reports, the author must work from Addendum 03 summaries and RFP descriptions only, reducing the depth and specificity of site condition findings.
- **Downstream deliverables:** DEL-02-01 (Concept Design), DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative), DEL-09-01 (Risk Register), and DEL-08-01 (Schedule) all consume outputs from DEL-09-02. Degraded site data would propagate to these consumers.
