# Assumptions Log — EST_DEL-04-01_2026-02-18_2300

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are representative of Alberta 2024 market rates for a Design-Build firm | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv header: "MARKET" basis, "MEDIUM" confidence. INDEX.md: "+/-20-30% accuracy." | Total could shift +/-$575 to $860 depending on rate variance direction. |
| ASM-002 | Level-of-effort hours (14h CM + 4h PM) are adequate for the consolidated SOW-019 + SOW-020 scope | Level_of_Effort.csv: "PARAMETRIC" basis; notes state "slightly more than 6b DEL-07-01." | If scope is larger than assumed, additional hours would increase cost proportionally. At +30%, total would be ~$3,730. |
| ASM-003 | No additional roles are required beyond Construction Manager and Project Manager for this deliverable | Level_of_Effort.csv lists only R-15 and R-02 for DEL-04-01. Safety Officer (R-20) is not separately allocated for this deliverable's production cost. | If Safety Officer review is separately charged, add ~2-4h at $110/hr = $220-$440 additional. |
| ASM-004 | This deliverable is purely a proposal production cost (narrative authorship) with no embedded construction pricing | Decomposition Section 8: output is "Construction methodology narrative." INDEX.md confirms PKG-06 uses only Staff_Rates, LOE, Parameters. | Correct per decomposition. No construction pricing content expected. |
