# Blocker Report — DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative

## Estimating Blockers

**None.** All pricing inputs (staff rates + level of effort hours) are available and sufficient for a complete estimate.

## Deliverable Execution Blockers (informational)

These upstream dependencies are PENDING and would block finalization of the deliverable content itself, but they do NOT block estimating because the cost estimate is based on staff effort allocation (hours x rates), which is independent of upstream content.

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-04-01-E-001 | DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None — hours are allocated regardless of concept availability |
| DEP-04-01-E-002 | DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None — hours are allocated regardless of schedule availability |
| DEP-04-01-E-003 | DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions & Due Diligence Summary) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None — hours are allocated regardless of site data availability |
| DEP-04-01-E-004 | DEL-05-03 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions) | INTERFACE | PENDING | None — cost-neutral interface alignment |
| DEP-04-01-E-009 | RFP Section 7.2 | CONSTRAINT | PENDING | None — compliance constraint affects content, not cost |
| DEP-04-01-E-010 | Addendum 03 | CONSTRAINT | PENDING | None — technical clarifications affect content, not cost |
