# Estimate Summary — DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative

## Basis of Estimate

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **BASIS_OF_ESTIMATE** | RATE_TABLE |
| **Method Used** | RATE_TABLE (all lines) |
| **Currency** | CAD |
| **Rounding** | DOLLAR |
| **Fallback Policy** | STRICT (no fallback needed) |
| **Mixed Methods** | FALSE (none used) |

## Scope

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Deliverable** | DEL-04-01 Construction Methodology Narrative |
| **Package** | PKG-06 Construction Methodology + Administration |
| **SOW Items** | SOW-019 (construction methodology), SOW-020 (construction administration) |
| **Tier** | T2 (depends on DEL-02-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-02) |

## Totals

| CBS | Amount (CAD) | Line Count |
|---|---:|---:|
| PROF_SERVICES | $2,870 | 2 |
| **Total** | **$2,870** | **2** |

## Breakdown by Role

| Role | Hours | Rate (CAD/hr) | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| R-15 Construction Manager | 14 | $155 | $2,170 |
| R-02 Project Manager | 4 | $175 | $700 |
| **Total** | **18** | | **$2,870** |

## Cost Drivers

- **Primary cost driver:** Construction Manager hours (76% of total). The CM authors the construction methodology narrative covering staging, logistics, site safety, sequencing (SOW-019) and construction administration covering cleaning, transport/storage, site services/utilities (SOW-020).
- **Secondary cost driver:** Project Manager input (24% of total). PM provides project controls input and coordination review.

## Key Observations

1. DEL-04-01 is a **pure proposal production cost** — no construction pricing content is embedded in this deliverable.
2. The 14-hour CM allocation is noted in Level_of_Effort.csv as "slightly more than 6b DEL-07-01" due to consolidation of SOW-019 + SOW-020 into a single deliverable.
3. All 3 upstream prerequisite dependencies (DEL-02-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-02) are PENDING but do not block estimating since cost is driven by staff effort hours, not by the content of those dependencies.
4. Cost ownership boundaries are respected: budget control/change management (SOW-021) is NOT included here (that belongs to DEL-04-02).

## Warnings

- None.

## Blockers (from dependency evidence)

- **Execution blockers for the deliverable itself** (not for estimating):
  - DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package) — PREREQUISITE, PENDING
  - DEL-08-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) — PREREQUISITE, PENDING
  - DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions & Due Diligence Summary) — PREREQUISITE, PENDING
- These do not block estimating because the cost estimate is based on staff effort, which is independent of upstream content availability.
