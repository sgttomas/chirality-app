## Dependency Assessment

### BLOCKING Dependencies (resolved)

| DependencyID | Target | Statement | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-03-004 | DEL-05-01 (Schedule A) | Narrative must be consistent with Schedule A pricing | Upstream estimate available: $10,738,960 total ($9,960 production + $10,729,000 construction content). Production cost estimation for DEL-05-03 does not require Schedule A figures -- it requires knowing HOW MUCH EFFORT to write the narrative, not WHAT the narrative says. |
| DEP-05-03-005 | DEL-05-02 (Schedule B) | Narrative must be consistent with Schedule B breakdown | Upstream estimate available: $10,735,020 total. Same rationale as above -- narrative production hours are independent of the pricing figures being narrated. |
| DEP-05-03-013 | RFP 2024_004 | RFP structure and compliance requirements govern narrative | RFP is a governing document integrated into decomposition. Compliance requirements inform narrative CONTENT (what to write), not production COST (how long to write it). |
| DEP-05-03-014 | Addendum 03 | Scope removals, allowance approach, FF&E treatment | Integrated into decomposition per CHG-003. |

### ADVISORY Dependencies (not blocking)

| DependencyID | Target | Statement | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-03-006 | DEL-02-01 (Concept Design) | Pricing assumptions must align with concept | Advisory for content; does not affect production cost estimate |
| DEP-05-03-007 | DEL-02-02 (Design Brief) | Pricing basis consistent with materials/systems | Advisory for content; does not affect production cost estimate |
| DEP-05-03-008 | DEL-04-01 (Construction Methodology) | Pricing assumptions must align with construction approach | Advisory for content; does not affect production cost estimate |
| DEP-05-03-009 | DEL-08-01 (Schedule) | Schedule assumptions must align | Advisory for content; does not affect production cost estimate |
| DEP-05-03-010 | DEL-09-02 (Site Conditions) | Site assumptions must reference site conditions | Advisory for content; does not affect production cost estimate |

### DOWNSTREAM Handovers (informational)

| DependencyID | Target | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-03-011 | DEL-09-01 (Risk Register) | Aggressive/uncertain assumptions feed risk identification |
| DEP-05-03-012 | DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission) | Narrative integrated into final proposal PDF |
