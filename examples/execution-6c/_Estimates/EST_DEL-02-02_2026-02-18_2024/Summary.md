## Key Observations

1. **Largest single production deliverable.** DEL-02-02 is confirmed as the largest single production effort in the 6c decomposition at 80 hours across 8 roles. This is consistent with INDEX.md notes and the BOE context provided.

2. **Multi-discipline coordination.** This deliverable requires input from all 5 engineering disciplines (civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, building science) plus architectural lead and PM coordination. The 6 PM hours represent coordination overhead across these disciplines.

3. **5 SOW items covered.** DEL-02-02 implements SOW-010 (Addendum 03 requirements in narratives), SOW-011 (design brief), SOW-013 (durability/maintenance), SOW-014 (adaptability/expansion), and SOW-015 (accessibility).

4. **Upstream dependency on DEL-02-01.** The concept design must be sufficiently developed before the design brief narrative can be authored. This is a sequencing constraint, not a blocker to estimating.

5. **No blockers to estimating.** All pricing inputs (rates + hours) are available and matched. No TBD amounts.
