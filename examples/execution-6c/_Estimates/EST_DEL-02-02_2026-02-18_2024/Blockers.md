## Summary

**Estimate-blocking dependencies: 0**
**Production-sequencing dependencies: 5**

No dependencies prevent meaningful estimating of DEL-02-02. All pricing inputs (rates and hours) are available from the price sources. The dependencies identified below affect production sequencing (when the work can start/complete) but do not affect the cost estimate.

## Production Sequencing Dependencies (not estimate blockers)

| DependencyID | Type | Target | Statement | Impact on Estimate |
|-------------|------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| DEP-0202-008 | PREREQUISITE | RFP-2024-004 | RFP must be accessible before beginning Design Brief production | None — RFP is a content input, not a pricing input |
| DEP-0202-009 | PREREQUISITE | ADD-03 (Addendum 03) | Addendum 03 must be accessible; mandatory technical clarifications | None — addendum is a content input, not a pricing input |
| DEP-0202-010 | PREREQUISITE | ADD-01 (Addendum 01) | Addendum 01 must be accessible; room dimension flexibility | None — addendum is a content input, not a pricing input |
| DEP-0202-011 | PREREQUISITE | GEOTECH-RPT | Geotechnical Report must be accessible for structural design brief | None — report is a content input, not a pricing input |
| DEP-0202-012 | INTERFACE | DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package) | Concept must be sufficiently developed before narrative can be written | None — concept maturity affects production timing, not cost of production |

## Downstream Dependencies (informational)

8 downstream dependencies exist (DEP-0202-013 through DEP-0202-019) indicating that DEL-02-02 outputs flow to DEL-02-03, DEL-03-01, DEL-03-02, DEL-01-02, DEL-05-01, DEL-05-03, and DEL-08-01. These are informational for production planning and do not affect this estimate.

## Conclusion

All pricing inputs for DEL-02-02 are available. The estimate of $12,170 CAD (80 hours) is not contingent on resolution of any upstream dependency.
