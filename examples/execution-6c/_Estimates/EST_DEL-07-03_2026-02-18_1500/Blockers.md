## Upstream Dependency Status

| DependencyID | Target | Status | Blocking? | Notes |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| DEP-07-03-005 | DEL-05-02 (Schedule B Cost Breakdown) | PENDING | No | Cross-check input for scope alignment; does not affect hours to produce the list. When DEL-05-02 is available, validate that subtrade scopes match pricing scopes. |
| DEP-07-03-006 | DEL-02-01 (Concept Design Package) | PENDING | No | Informs which specialty consultants/trades are required. When concept is available, confirm discipline list covers all required specialties. Does not change production hours. |
| DEP-07-03-007 | RFP Appendix I Template | PENDING | No | Required for final formatting of the deliverable. If template is more complex than assumed, admin hours (R-24) may need upward adjustment. |
| DEP-07-03-008 | Addendum 03 | SATISFIED | No | Scope clarifications already integrated. |
