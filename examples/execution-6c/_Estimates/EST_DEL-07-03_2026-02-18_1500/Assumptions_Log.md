| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|-------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| A-EST-07-03-001 | PM hourly rate of $175/hr CAD reflects actual internal DB firm rate for proposal production | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv R-02 (Basis: MARKET, Confidence: MEDIUM) | If actual rate is higher/lower, amount changes proportionally. At 8 hours, +/-$25/hr = +/-$200 impact. |
| A-EST-07-03-002 | Administrative hourly rate of $80/hr CAD reflects actual internal firm rate | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv R-24 (Basis: MARKET, Confidence: MEDIUM) | If actual rate is higher/lower, amount changes proportionally. At 4 hours, +/-$15/hr = +/-$60 impact. |
| A-EST-07-03-003 | 8 PM hours is sufficient for subtrade/consultant procurement coordination, including interface management with DEL-02-01 and DEL-05-02 | Level_of_Effort.csv DEL-07-03 R-02 (Basis: PARAMETRIC) | If the subtrade procurement process is more complex (e.g., extensive market outreach, multiple rounds of confirmation), hours could increase by 50-100%. |
| A-EST-07-03-004 | 4 admin hours is sufficient for Appendix I form completion and data entry | Level_of_Effort.csv DEL-07-03 R-24 (Basis: PARAMETRIC) | If the Appendix I template requires extensive detail per subtrade or if the team list is large (>15 subtrades), hours could increase by 50-100%. |
| A-EST-07-03-005 | Cross-document consistency checking (with DEL-07-01 and DEL-07-02) is adequately captured within the 8 PM hours | BOE Section 4 PKG-03 cost ownership rules: "Cross-document consistency checking = shared coordination overhead in each DEL" | If consistency checking requires dedicated review cycles beyond normal coordination, additional PM hours may be needed. |
| A-EST-07-03-006 | No specialist technical hours are needed for the subtrade list (PM can identify required disciplines from concept and pricing information) | BOE cost driver description: "PM hours; subtrade/consultant procurement coordination; Appendix I form completion" | If technical discipline leads need to be consulted to confirm specialty requirements, their hours would need to be added. |
