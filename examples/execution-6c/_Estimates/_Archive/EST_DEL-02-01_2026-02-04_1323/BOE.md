## Contracting Assumptions

| Assumption ID | Assumption | Impact |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| A-001 | Design services performed in-house by proposal team | Labor rates reflect internal design team |
| A-002 | Lead Architect available full-time during concept development | No premium for resource constraints |
| A-003 | Supporting disciplines (Civil, Structural, MEP, Code) available for coordination | Standard coordination allowances |

---

## Location and Productivity Assumptions

| Assumption ID | Assumption | Impact |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| A-004 | Design work performed in Alberta or remote | No location premium |
| A-005 | Standard productivity for concept-level deliverables | Based on typical proposal timeline |
| A-006 | CAD/BIM tools and software available | No procurement delays |

---

## Pricing Sources Hierarchy

1. **QUOTE:** No vendor quotes available for design services
2. **RATE_TABLE:** No rate tables provided in _RateTables/ directory
3. **ALLOWANCE:** All items priced using allowances based on typical design effort for proposal-stage concept packages

**Note:** All line items use ALLOWANCE method due to absence of rate tables. Confidence is LOW to MED.

---

## Indirects Model

- **Method:** Factor-based (default)
- **Project Management:** Included as coordination allowance
- **QA/Review:** Explicit line item for peer review
- **No construction indirects applicable** (design services deliverable)

---

## Contingency Method and Rationale

- **Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (default)
- **Engineering/Design Contingency:** 15% applied to base estimate
- **Rationale:** Moderate uncertainty in scope definition; concept-level deliverable with some TBDs in source documents (e.g., Appendix B access, Town setback requirements)

---

## Escalation Method

- **Mode:** NONE (default)
- **Rationale:** Short-duration deliverable for proposal submission; no escalation required

---

## Rounding Policy

- **Rounding:** Nearest $100 for line items; nearest $1,000 for totals
- **Rationale:** Appropriate precision for proposal-stage estimate

---

## Completeness Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % Lines Priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % Lines Priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % Lines Priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| % Deliverables with Explicit Quantities | 100% (single deliverable scope) |

---

## Known Gaps

1. **Functional Program (Appendix B):** Location TBD; room-by-room verification may require scope adjustment
2. **Town Setback Requirements:** TBD; may affect site concept rework
3. **Rate Tables:** Not available; all pricing based on allowances
4. **Detailed Load Analysis:** Generator sizing TBD; affects MEP coordination scope
