## Key Assumptions

1. **Commissioning Lead availability** at estimated hourly rate (A-001)
2. **Technical Lead support** limited to input only, not co-authoring (A-017, A-018)
3. **Single iteration cycle** for quality review; additional rework covered by contingency
4. **RFP requirements** derivable from decomposition; no surprises from actual RFP text
5. **Cross-deliverables** (schedule, methodology, team) available in draft form for coordination

## Key Risks Affecting Estimate

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| R-001: RFP requirements differ from decomposition | +20% effort | Early RFP review; contingency reserve |
| R-002: Cross-deliverable inconsistencies | +15% effort | Coordination steps in procedure; contingency |
| R-003: Multiple quality review iterations | +25% effort | Contingency reserve; quality gate discipline |
| R-004: Technical input delays | +10% effort | Early engagement of technical leads |
