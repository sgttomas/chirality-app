## Estimate Confidence Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Scope Definition | HIGH | Well-documented in 4 documents + _CONTEXT.md |
| Quantity Basis | MEDIUM | Effort hours estimated from procedure steps |
| Pricing Basis | LOW | All allowances; no rate tables available |
| Overall Confidence | LOW-MEDIUM | Suitable for budget planning; refine with actual rates |

---

## Key Assumptions Affecting Estimate

1. **A-001:** Design Manager/PM rate assumed at $175/hr (Alberta typical)
2. **A-008:** Two stakeholder review cycles assumed
3. **D-003:** 15% PM overhead applied to direct labor
4. **D-004:** 20% contingency on Engineering; 15% on PM

---

## Comparison Context

| Metric | This Estimate | Industry Typical Range |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| Hours for methodology narrative | 63 hours | 40-80 hours |
| Cost per evaluation point (3 pts) | $5,378/pt | Varies by proposal |
| % of typical proposal budget | ~3-5% | 2-8% for methodology section |

---

## Recommendations for Future Runs

1. **Provide rate tables:** Add actual team labor rates to `_Estimates/_RateTables/` to replace allowances
2. **Refine graphics scope:** Clarify number and complexity of visual aids required
3. **Track actual effort:** Compare to this estimate post-production for calibration
4. **Consider bundling:** This deliverable closely related to DEL-03-02; consider combined estimate
