## Pricing Sources Hierarchy

| Priority | Source Type | Available | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Vendor Quotes | No | N/A |
| 2 | Project Rate Tables | No | N/A |
| 3 | Historical Data | No | N/A |
| 4 | **Allowances (Parametric)** | **Yes** | **Primary - All line items** |

**Note:** No rate tables or vendor quotes were available. All pricing is based on parametric allowances using typical Alberta Design-Build construction cost benchmarks.

## Estimating Methodology

### Base Estimate Approach
- **Method:** Parametric/Order-of-Magnitude using square-footage and component-based allowances
- **Building Area Assumptions:**
  - Main Building (Fire Hall + Public Works): Estimated 15,000 SF (per typical combined facility)
  - Cold Storage Building: 6,000 SF (60' x 100')
  - Total Building Area: ~21,000 SF
- **Unit Cost Basis:** Alberta Design-Build institutional/industrial construction benchmarks
- **Confidence Level:** LOW (allowance-based; no detailed quantity takeoff)

### Cost Categories (CBS)
| CBS Code | Category | Application |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| E | Engineering & Design | 8-12% of construction |
| PM | Project Management / EPCM | 3-5% of construction |
| MAT | Equipment & Materials | Within construction directs |
| CD | Construction Directs | Building + site construction |
| CI | Construction Indirects | Field overhead, supervision |
| COM | Commissioning / Startup | Training, handover |
| CONT | Contingency | Risk reserve |

### Indirects Model
- **Applied as:** Factor-based percentage of direct costs
- **Supervision/Field Overhead:** 8% of construction directs
- **Commissioning:** 2% of construction directs

### Contingency Method
- **Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by cost category)
- **Rationale:** Allowance-heavy estimate requires higher contingency to account for scope uncertainty
- **Base Contingency:** 15% of base estimate (pre-contingency)
- **Contingency Range:** 12-20% depending on category maturity

## Rounding Policy

- **Line Items:** Rounded to nearest $1,000 CAD
- **Totals:** Rounded to nearest $1,000 CAD
- **Precision Statement:** This is a Class 5/Class 4 estimate (-30% to +50% accuracy range)

## Completeness Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % Lines priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by ALLOWANCE/PARAMETRIC | 100% |
| % Deliverables with explicit quantities | 20% (building dimensions only) |
| Coverage | Full (all 7 Schedule A lines addressed) |

---

## Known Gaps

1. **No detailed quantity takeoff:** Building areas are estimated from RFP descriptions
2. **No subcontractor pricing:** All costs are parametric benchmarks
3. **Service tie-in costs uncertain:** Allowance approach per Addendum 03 permission
4. **Site conditions unknown:** Survey not provided until post-award
5. **Room-specific costs not broken out:** Room sizing flexibility per Addendum 03

## Key Assumptions

See `Assumptions_Log.md` for complete list. Major assumptions:
- A-001: Building areas estimated from functional program description
- A-002: Alberta Design-Build benchmark costs applicable
- A-003: 12-acre site development (per Addendum 03)
- A-004: Cash allowance approach for service tie-ins

---

## Key Decisions

See `Decision_Log.md` for complete list. Major decisions:
- D-001: Currency set to CAD
- D-002: Allowance method used (no rate tables available)
- D-003: Contingency at 15% of base estimate
