## R-001: Building Area Uncertainty

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope/Quantity |
| **Cause** | RFP does not specify explicit building area; functional program allows flexible room sizing |
| **Consequence** | Actual building area could be 20-30% higher than estimated, increasing construction costs proportionally |
| **Affected CBS** | CD, E, CI, COM |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | HIGH |
| **Impact** | HIGH (~$1-2M potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Develop design concept early to confirm area; use functional program room ranges to establish target area |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 15% contingency factor |

## R-002: Unit Cost Escalation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-002 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price |
| **Cause** | Estimate uses parametric benchmarks; actual market conditions may differ |
| **Consequence** | Material costs, labor rates, or subcontractor pricing may exceed benchmarks |
| **Affected CBS** | CD, CI |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM (~$500K-1M potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Obtain early subcontractor budget pricing; validate benchmarks against recent Alberta projects |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 15% contingency factor |

---

## R-003: Site Conditions Unknown

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope/Quantity |
| **Cause** | Survey to be provided post-award (Addendum 03 section 1.20); geotechnical conditions unknown |
| **Consequence** | Site work scope may expand; foundation requirements may increase |
| **Affected CBS** | CD |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 (Site Work line) |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM (~$200-500K potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Request geotechnical report during proposal phase if available; include site condition caveat in proposal |
| **Contingency Handling** | Partially covered in 15% contingency; service tie-in allowance provides additional buffer |

---

## R-004: Service Tie-In Costs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price/Scope |
| **Cause** | Utility locations and requirements unknown; allowance approach used |
| **Consequence** | Actual tie-in costs may exceed or be under allowance |
| **Affected CBS** | CD |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 (Service Tie-Ins line) |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM (~$50-150K potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Cash allowance approach transfers risk to Owner; document in proposal |
| **Contingency Handling** | Risk transferred via allowance approach per Addendum 03 section 1.7 |

---

## R-005: Schedule-Driven Cost Impacts

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | Schedule |
| **Cause** | Although RFP states project is "not schedule-driven," actual construction timing may affect costs |
| **Consequence** | Winter construction, material availability, or labor constraints could increase costs |
| **Affected CBS** | CD, CI |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM (~$200-400K potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Develop schedule that optimizes construction seasons; build in weather contingency |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 15% contingency factor |

---

## R-006: Design Development Scope Growth

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-006 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope |
| **Cause** | Functional program allows flexibility; design development may reveal additional requirements |
| **Consequence** | Design-Builder absorbs scope growth under fixed-price contract |
| **Affected CBS** | All |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | HIGH (~$500K-1M potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Careful OSR review; document assumptions clearly in proposal; identify allowable scope boundaries |
| **Contingency Handling** | Primary reason for 15% contingency |

---

## R-007: Bonding Capacity/Rates

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-007 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price |
| **Cause** | Bond rates assumed at standard percentages; actual rates depend on contractor credit |
| **Consequence** | Bond costs could be higher if contractor has limited bonding capacity |
| **Affected CBS** | MAT |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 (Bonding lines) |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | LOW (~$25-50K potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Confirm surety availability and rates early |
| **Contingency Handling** | Minor impact; partially in contingency |

---

## R-008: Regulatory/Code Changes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-008 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope |
| **Cause** | Building codes or regulations may change between estimate and construction |
| **Consequence** | Additional code compliance costs |
| **Affected CBS** | CD |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | LOW-MEDIUM (~$50-150K potential variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Confirm applicable code editions at time of permit application |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 15% contingency factor |

## R-009: Option Scope Interpretation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-009 |

| **Consequence** | Option costs may be under/over actual requirements |
| **Affected CBS** | CD (Options) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 (Options 1-6) |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM (~$50-150K potential variance across all options) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Document scope assumptions in pricing narrative; seek clarification if scope unclear |
| **Contingency Handling** | Options priced without separate contingency; base contingency provides some coverage |

---

## R-010: Inflation/Escalation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-010 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price |
| **Cause** | Estimate uses 2026-02 pricing; construction may extend into 2027+ |
| **Consequence** | Material and labor cost inflation could erode margins |
| **Affected CBS** | CD, CI, MAT |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM (~2-5% annual escalation = $200-500K) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Build escalation into schedule-based pricing if project extends beyond 12 months |
| **Contingency Handling** | Escalation mode = NONE (not explicitly separated); partially in contingency |

3. **Post-Award:** Request geotechnical report for site conditions
4. **Ongoing:** Track material price trends for major cost items
