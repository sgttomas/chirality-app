| **Package** | PKG-03 Team Qualifications (Appendix I + resumes) |
| **Type** | Compliance Document |
| **Responsible Party** | Proposal Manager + HR/Team Admin |

### Scope Inclusions

This estimate covers the cost of producing the Appendix I Subtrade and Consultant List deliverable, which includes:

1. **Document Assembly Labor** - Compiling team roster from internal records
2. **Template Acquisition and Formatting** - Obtaining RFP template, formatting final table
3. **Coordination Activities** - Cross-referencing with DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-05-02
4. **Quality Review** - Proposal Manager review and approval cycle
5. **Scope Coverage Work** - Identifying and documenting 12+ discipline categories
6. **Specialty Systems Documentation** - Documenting 6 specialty system teams per Addendum 03
7. **Integration Work** - Final integration into proposal PDF (DEL-01-02)
8. **Compliance Matrix Update** - Updating DEL-01-01 to reflect completion

### Scope Exclusions

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Pickled sand storage building team | Removed per Addendum 03 (Decomposition Section 4) |
| Actual subtrade/consultant fees | This is proposal preparation cost only, not project execution |
| DEL-07-01 (Firm Experience Narrative) | Separate deliverable |
| DEL-07-02 (Key Team Members and Resumes) | Separate deliverable |
| Printing/binding costs | Assumed included in proposal production overhead |

## Pricing Basis

### Pricing Sources Hierarchy

| Priority | Source Type | Status | Application |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Vendor Quotes | NOT AVAILABLE | N/A |
| 2 | Project Rate Tables | NOT AVAILABLE | N/A |
| 3 | Allowances | USED | All line items priced via allowances |

**Decision D-001:** No rate tables or vendor quotes available. All line items priced using allowances based on typical proposal preparation effort for municipal Design-Build projects. Confidence: LOW.

### Pricing Assumptions

| Assumption ID | Description | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| A-001 | Proposal Manager labor rate assumed at CAD 150/hr (fully burdened) | Moderate |
| A-002 | HR/Team Admin labor rate assumed at CAD 85/hr (fully burdened) | Moderate |
| A-003 | Document assembly effort estimated at 16-24 hours total | High |
| A-004 | Quality review cycle assumed at 2-4 hours | Low |
| A-005 | Coordination work with other deliverables estimated at 4-8 hours | Moderate |

## Contracting Assumptions

| Assumption | Description | Source |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Labor Type | Internal staff (proposal team) | ASSUMPTION |
| Overhead | Labor rates fully burdened including overhead | ASSUMPTION |
| Delivery Model | Design-Build proposal preparation | Decomposition Section 1 |

---

## Location/Productivity Assumptions

| Assumption | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Work Location | Office-based (remote or in-person) |
| Productivity Factor | Standard office productivity assumed |
| Geographic Adjustments | Alberta labor market rates assumed |

---

## Indirects Model

For this proposal preparation deliverable, indirects are embedded in the fully burdened labor rates. No separate indirects line items are required.

**Decision D-002:** Indirects embedded in labor rates rather than applied as separate percentage. This is appropriate for proposal preparation scope which is primarily labor-driven.

---

## Contingency Method and Rationale

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (default)

| CBS Category | Base Estimate | Contingency % | Contingency Amount | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Engineering & Design (E) | CAD 4,450 | 15% | CAD 668 | All items ALLOWANCE-priced; higher uncertainty |

**Decision D-003:** Applied 15% contingency to allowance-heavy estimate. Higher than typical 10% due to 100% reliance on allowances.

---

## Escalation Method and Rationale

**Mode:** NONE (default)

No escalation applied. Proposal preparation work is immediate scope with no material price escalation exposure.

---

## Rounding Policy

All amounts rounded to nearest CAD 10 for line items, nearest CAD 100 for summaries.

## Completeness Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % Lines priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| % Deliverables with explicit quantities | 0% (lump sum scope) |
| Confidence Level | LOW |

---

## Known Gaps

| Gap ID | Description | Impact | Resolution Path |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| G-001 | No vendor quotes available | Cannot validate labor estimates | Obtain actual proposal team time tracking data |
| G-002 | No rate tables available | Must use assumed rates | Provide project rate tables to _RateTables/ |
| G-003 | Actual team size unknown | Effort may vary with team complexity | Scope may need adjustment based on actual team composition |
