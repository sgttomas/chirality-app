## Risk Summary

| Risk Level | Count | Key Risks |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| High | 0 | - |
| Medium | 5 | R-001, R-002, R-003, R-004, R-006 |

## Contingency Calculation

| Method | PCT_BY_BUCKET |
|--------|---------------|
| CBS Category | E (Engineering & Design) |
| Base Estimate | CAD 4,450 |
| Contingency % | 15% |
| Contingency Amount | CAD 670 |
| **Total with Contingency** | **CAD 5,120** |

**Rationale for 15%:**
- 100% allowance-based pricing (higher uncertainty than mixed-method)
- 7 identified risks (5 medium, 2 low)
- Proposal preparation scope with manageable risk profile
- 15% contingency provides adequate coverage for identified risks
