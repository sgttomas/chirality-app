## Recommendations

1. **Track Actual Hours:** Track actual proposal team hours against this estimate for future calibration
2. **Provide Rate Tables:** Add project labor rate tables to `_Estimates/_RateTables/` for future runs
3. **Confirm Team Size:** Actual number of firms/personnel to list will affect effort; estimate assumes 25-30 firms
4. **Coordinate Early:** Start cross-referencing with DEL-07-01 and DEL-07-02 early to avoid late rework
