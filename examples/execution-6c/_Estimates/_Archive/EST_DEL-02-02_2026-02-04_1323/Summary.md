|------------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| HIGH | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| MEDIUM | 24 | 27,000 | 87% |
| LOW | 2 | 3,900 | 13% |

**Overall Estimate Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Rationale:** All line items priced using allowances based on deliverable scope analysis. No rate tables or historical data available. Effort estimates based on RFP requirements complexity and typical proposal development patterns.

## Key Cost Drivers

1. **Architectural Design Brief (40 hrs):** Largest effort driver - includes site plan, building layout, elevations, and integration with Concept Design
2. **Durability/Maintenance Narrative (12 hrs):** Premium allocation per D-010 due to 15-point scoring impact
3. **Electrical/IT Design Brief (26 hrs):** Complex Addendum 03 requirements (generator, solar-ready, ICP infrastructure)
4. **Mechanical Design Brief (18 hrs):** Fire apparatus exhaust and dual-function ventilation complexity
5. **PM Coordination (20 hrs):** Cross-discipline coordination and RFP compliance verification

---

## Assumptions Summary

- Professional services hourly rates: CAD 125-175/hr typical for Central Alberta
- 154 total engineering hours + 20 PM hours = 174 total hours
- No site visits required for narrative deliverable
- Single review/revision cycle included
- Coordination with DEL-02-01 (Concept Design) included
