## EST_DEL-02-02_2026-02-04_1323

**Deliverable:** DEL-02-02 DesignBriefNarrative
**Package:** PKG-04 Design Proposal (Concept + Design Brief)

---

## Risks

### R-001: Fire Station Design Expertise Availability
**Risk Driver:** Scope (specialized expertise)

**Cause:** Guidance.md Consideration 2 notes fire station design requires specialized expertise; if Design-Build team lacks this experience, additional consultant engagement may be required.

**Consequence:** Increased effort/cost for fire service narrative sections; potential quality impact if expertise gap not addressed.

**Affected CBS/WBS:** E (Engineering); PKG-04/DEL-02-02

**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Verify team includes architect/engineer with prior fire station experience
- If gap exists, engage fire station design consultant or partner with Fire Chief as SME
- Budget contingency covers moderate scope expansion

**Contingency Handling:** Included in 15% Engineering contingency (R-001 contributes ~5% of contingency allocation).

---

### R-002: Coordination Complexity with DEL-02-01
**Risk Driver:** Interface (cross-deliverable dependency)

**Cause:** Design Brief narrative must align with Concept Design Package (DEL-02-01); if concept development is delayed or changes significantly, narrative requires rework.

**Consequence:** Additional revision cycles; potential schedule delay; increased effort beyond estimate.

**Affected CBS/WBS:** E (Engineering), PM; PKG-04/DEL-02-02

**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Parallel development with frequent sync points per Procedure.md Step 4f
- Establish Design Brief as authority per Specification.md
- PM coordination budget covers moderate iteration

**Contingency Handling:** Included in 15% Engineering and 10% PM contingency.

---

### R-003: Requirements Interpretation Ambiguity
**Risk Driver:** Scope (RFP interpretation)

**Cause:** RFP Section 7.1.2-7.1.5 requirements have some flexibility; Addendum 01 confirms functional program intentionally omits dimensions for innovation. Interpretation choices may not align with evaluator expectations.

**Consequence:** Narrative may miss evaluator preferences; potential scoring impact.

**Affected CBS/WBS:** E (Engineering); PKG-04/DEL-02-02

**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Follow Specification.md requirements matrix (REQ-001 through REQ-037)
- Emphasize durability narrative per 15-point scoring weight
- Reference RFP/OSR explicitly throughout narrative

**Contingency Handling:** Scope risk partially addressed by QA verification effort (PM-002).

---

### R-004: Addendum 03 Integration Complexity
**Risk Driver:** Scope (regulatory/requirements change)

**Cause:** Addendum 03 introduces significant technical clarifications (16' doors, exhaust, generator, sumps, solar-ready, fill stations) that must be explicitly addressed across all discipline briefs.

**Consequence:** Omission of any Addendum 03 requirement could impact compliance; additional effort to ensure complete coverage.

**Affected CBS/WBS:** E (Engineering), PM; PKG-04/DEL-02-02

**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Use Specification.md Addendum 03 Technical Requirements table as checklist
- PM-002 compliance verification explicitly checks Addendum 03 items
- Each discipline brief section cross-references applicable Addendum 03 sections

**Contingency Handling:** Included in base effort allocation; PM contingency provides buffer.

---

### R-005: Professional Services Rate Variability
**Risk Driver:** Price (rate uncertainty)

**Cause:** All rates are assumed allowances (A-001 through A-006); actual contracted rates may differ from CAD 125-175/hr range.

**Consequence:** Estimate could be high or low by 10-20% based on actual rate agreements.

**Affected CBS/WBS:** E (Engineering), PM; all line items

**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Obtain actual rate agreements before project execution
- Provide rate tables to enable rate-based estimating
- Range estimate: CAD 26,000 - 34,000 (excluding contingency)

**Contingency Handling:** Contingency provides buffer for moderate rate variance; not intended to cover major rate deviations.

---

### R-006: Iteration Cycles Beyond Estimate
**Risk Driver:** Productivity (review cycles)

**Cause:** Estimate assumes single review/revision cycle; complex proposals may require multiple iterations based on internal feedback.

**Consequence:** Each additional cycle adds ~10-15% effort (15-25 hours).

**Affected CBS/WBS:** E (Engineering), PM; PKG-04/DEL-02-02

**Suggested Mitigation:**
- Clear approval gates per Procedure.md
- Limit revision scope with clear acceptance criteria
- PM coordination manages review efficiency

**Contingency Handling:** One additional review cycle covered by contingency allocation.
