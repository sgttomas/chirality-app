- Accessibility Narrative (RFP 7.1.3)
- Building Durability / Ease of Repair and Maintenance Narrative (RFP 7.1.4)
- Adaptability, Flexibility, Potential for Expansion Narrative (RFP 7.1.5)
- Internal coordination with Concept Design Package (DEL-02-01)
- QA/QC review and cross-document consistency verification
- Document formatting and PDF production

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md; Specification.md REQ-001 through REQ-037; RFP Section 7.1.2-7.1.5

## 2. Scope Exclusions

- Concept Design drawings (covered by DEL-02-01)
- Detailed engineering design (subsequent project phases)
- Sustainability and Energy Narrative (covered by DEL-02-03)
- Pricing/cost estimating content (covered by PKG-02 deliverables)
- Construction methodology (covered by PKG-06 deliverables)
- Pickled sand storage building (removed from scope per Addendum 03)
- Owner's costs, land acquisition, financing

**Source:** Specification.md Out of Scope section; Addendum 03 Section 1.2

## 3. Contracting Assumptions

- Work performed by Design-Build team professionals on fixed-price proposal basis
- Labor includes Lead Architect, Civil Engineer, Structural Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Proposal Manager contributions
- Professional hourly rates typical for Central Alberta region
- No travel or subsistence costs (team assumed local or remote working)

**Decision Reference:** D-001 (contracting basis)

---

## 4. Location/Productivity Assumptions

- Work location: Central Alberta (Penhold region context)
- No site visits required for this narrative deliverable
- Professional productivity at typical consulting engineer rates
- Document production uses standard office tools (no specialized software costs)

**Decision Reference:** D-002 (location/productivity)

---

## 5. Pricing Sources Hierarchy

1. **Quotes/Vendor Budgets:** None available
2. **Project Rate Tables:** None available in `_RateTables/`
3. **Allowances (used):** Engineering/consulting effort estimated based on deliverable scope and complexity

All line items priced using ALLOWANCE method with explicit assumptions logged.

**Decision Reference:** D-003 (pricing hierarchy)

---

## 6. Indirects Model

- Indirect costs (overhead, profit) embedded in professional services rates
- No separate construction indirects applicable (document deliverable, not construction)
- EPCM/PM effort captured in coordination and QA activities

**Decision Reference:** D-004 (indirects model)

---

## 7. Contingency Method

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by CBS bucket)

| CBS Bucket | Base Amount (CAD) | Contingency % | Contingency (CAD) |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Engineering & Design (E) | 24,000 | 15% | 3,600 |
| Project Management (PM) | 3,000 | 10% | 300 |
| **Total** | 27,000 | -- | 3,900 |

**Rationale:** 15% contingency on Engineering reflects uncertainty in scope complexity and iteration cycles; 10% on PM reflects coordination uncertainty. Higher contingency applied because all pricing is allowance-based.

**Decision Reference:** D-005 (contingency method)

---

## 8. Escalation Method

**Mode:** NONE

No escalation applied. Pricing date equals expected execution period (Q1 2026).

**Decision Reference:** D-006 (escalation mode)

---

## 9. Rounding Policy

All amounts rounded to nearest CAD 100 for line items; totals to nearest CAD 1,000.

---

## 10. Completeness Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % Lines priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| % Deliverables with explicit quantities | 100% (effort hours estimated) |
| Overall Confidence | LOW-MEDIUM |

---

## 11. Known Gaps

1. No professional services rate tables available - used allowance estimates
2. Actual hours depend on coordination complexity with DEL-02-01 (Concept Design)
3. Iteration cycles with client/internal review not quantified - allowance covers typical proposal development
4. Fire station design expertise availability may affect effort (Guidance.md Consideration 2)

- **Assumptions Log:** Assumptions_Log.md (A-001 through A-008)
