## Assumptions

### A-001: Architectural Professional Rate
**Statement:** Lead Architect hourly rate assumed at CAD 175/hr.

**Why Needed:** No rate table available; required to price architectural effort line items.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-04/DEL-02-02; CBS E (Engineering & Design)

**Cost Impact:** CAD 9,100 (52 architectural hours at CAD 175/hr)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Resolution Path:** Provide professional services rate table or actual contracted rates in `_RateTables/`.

---

### A-002: Durability Narrative Effort Premium
**Statement:** Durability/Maintenance narrative requires 12 additional hours (premium) due to high evaluation scoring weight (15 points).

**Why Needed:** Guidance.md emphasizes this is highest-value category; Procedure.md recommends 1450-1750 words. Standard effort insufficient.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-04/DEL-02-02; CBS E

**Cost Impact:** CAD 2,100 additional

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Resolution Path:** Historical data on durability narrative effort from similar proposals.

---

**Cost Impact:** CAD 4,290 (26 electrical hours at CAD 165/hr)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Resolution Path:** Provide professional services rate table.

---

### A-007: Additional Narrative Effort
**Statement:** Accessibility and Adaptability/Flexibility narratives require 10 combined hours at Lead Architect rate.

**Why Needed:** RFP Sections 7.1.3 and 7.1.5 require these narratives; effort estimated based on scope.

**Impacted WBS/CBS:** PKG-04/DEL-02-02; CBS E

**Cost Impact:** CAD 1,750 (10 hours at CAD 175/hr)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
