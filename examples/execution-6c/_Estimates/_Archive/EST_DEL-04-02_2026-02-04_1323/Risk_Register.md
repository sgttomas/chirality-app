## Risk Details

### R-001: RFP Section 7 Requirements Unknown

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | RFP Section 7 detailed requirements not accessible (PDF not available); detailed budget control and change management expectations marked TBD |
| **Consequence** | Plan may require significant revision if RFP Section 7 contains prescriptive requirements not anticipated in current scope |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E category - Plan section drafting (L-001 through L-007) |
| **Likelihood** | MEDIUM - RFP typically contains specific requirements |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM - Could add 4-8 hours of rework effort ($560-$1,120) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Human review of RFP Section 7 PDF before finalizing plan; early engagement with Owner if possible |
| **Contingency Handling** | Covered by 15% contingency on E category ($938) |

---

### R-002: Appendix H Dependency

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk Driver** | Interface/coordination |
| **Cause** | Budget Control Plan must be consistent with Appendix H pricing (DEL-05-01/02/03); coordination effort depends on Appendix H completeness |
| **Consequence** | If Appendix H is incomplete or changes, consistency verification effort increases and potential rework required |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E category - Consistency verification (L-013), Section 2 Budget Baseline (L-002) |
| **Likelihood** | MEDIUM - Parallel deliverable development common |
| **Impact** | LOW - Likely 2-4 hours additional effort ($260-$520) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Coordinate closely with Appendix H development; use placeholder text with clear TBD flags if Appendix H not complete |
| **Contingency Handling** | Covered by 15% contingency on E category ($938) |

---

### R-003: Iteration Cycles

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk Driver** | Quality/rework |
| **Cause** | Internal review (Procedure Step 9) may identify issues requiring multiple revision cycles |
| **Consequence** | Additional drafting and review effort beyond single-cycle assumption |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E and PM categories - Drafting and review lines |
| **Likelihood** | LOW - Plan structure well-defined by Specification and Guidance |
| **Impact** | MEDIUM - Could add 4-8 hours per cycle ($560-$1,120) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Thorough first draft using Specification REQs as checklist; engage reviewers early on outline |
| **Contingency Handling** | Covered by 15% contingency ($1,247 total) |

---

### R-004: Owner Preference Changes

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk Driver** | Scope change |
| **Cause** | Owner (Town of Penhold) may have specific preferences for reporting format, thresholds, or processes not captured in RFP |
| **Consequence** | Plan may require modification during contract negotiation (post-proposal, out of estimate scope) or during Working Items session |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E category - Cost Reporting section (L-004), Templates (L-008 through L-011) |
| **Likelihood** | LOW - Proposal phase; Owner feedback comes later |
| **Impact** | LOW - Proposal scope; post-award changes not in this estimate |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Use industry-standard defaults with clear "negotiable during contract" language |
| **Contingency Handling** | Covered by 15% contingency; post-award changes out of scope |

---

### R-005: Resource Availability

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk Driver** | Productivity |
| **Cause** | CM, Commercial Lead, or PM may have competing priorities during proposal development |
| **Consequence** | Work may be delayed or require handoff to different resources with learning curve |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | All line items |
| **Likelihood** | LOW - Proposal team typically dedicated |
| **Impact** | LOW - Schedule impact rather than cost; minimal cost increase |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Confirm resource availability early; have backup resources identified |
| **Contingency Handling** | Covered by 15% contingency |

## Contingency Summary

| CBS Category | Base Cost | Contingency % | Contingency $ | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Engineering & Design (E) | $6,260 | 15% | $938 | RFP requirements uncertainty + coordination complexity |
| Project Management (PM) | $2,060 | 15% | $309 | Iteration cycle potential |
| **Total** | **$8,320** | **15%** | **$1,247** | |

**Contingency Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (default per AGENT_ESTIMATING protocol)

**Rationale for 15% Rate:**
- Class 5/4 estimate maturity (conceptual/feasibility level)
- RFP Section 7 detailed requirements TBD (scope uncertainty)
- Coordination with parallel deliverables (interface risk)
- First-time plan development for this project (no historical baseline)
- Industry norm: 10-20% for proposal/plan development work
