| **Quantity Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Pricing Confidence** | LOW |

**Rationale:**
- Quantities based on plan structure from Procedure.md (7 sections, 4 templates)
- Pricing based on allowance rates (no rate tables available)
- Effort estimates are parametric based on typical proposal document development

## Key Assumptions Impacting Estimate

1. **A-001/A-002/A-003**: Professional hourly rates ($140-$150/hr CM/PM, $130/hr Commercial Lead)
2. **A-005**: Section drafting effort based on complexity (4-8 hrs per section)
3. **A-006**: Template development effort (2-3 hrs per template)
4. **A-012**: Validation walkthrough included as optional allowance

---

## Key Risks Impacting Estimate

1. **R-001**: RFP Section 7 requirements unknown - may increase effort
2. **R-002**: Appendix H dependency - coordination effort may increase
3. **R-003**: Iteration cycles with Owner preferences - may require rework
