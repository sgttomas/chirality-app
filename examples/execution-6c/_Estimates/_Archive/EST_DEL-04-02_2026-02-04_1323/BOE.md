## Contracting Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Construction Manager hourly rate** | CAD $140/hr | A-001 (CM rate allowance) |
| **Commercial Lead hourly rate** | CAD $130/hr | A-002 (Commercial rate allowance) |
| **Proposal Manager hourly rate** | CAD $150/hr | A-003 (PM rate allowance) |
| **Labour basis** | Fully burdened rates | A-004 |
| **Overhead/markup** | Included in hourly rates | A-004 |

---

## Location / Productivity Assumptions

| Factor | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Work location** | Office-based | Proposal development work |
| **Productivity factor** | 1.0 (standard) | No site or remote work adjustments |
| **Working hours** | 8 hrs/day | Standard office day |

---

## Pricing Sources Hierarchy

This estimate uses the following pricing hierarchy (per AGENT_ESTIMATING protocol):

1. **QUOTE** - Not available (no vendor quotes for professional services)
2. **RATE_TABLE** - Not available (_RateTables/ folder is empty)
3. **ALLOWANCE** - Used for all pricing (see Assumptions_Log.md)

**Pricing Method Distribution:**
- ALLOWANCE: 100%
- RATE_TABLE: 0%
- QUOTE: 0%

---

## Indirects Model

This is a professional services / proposal management deliverable. Indirects are embedded in the fully-burdened hourly rates. No separate construction indirects apply.

---

## Contingency Method and Rationale

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Method** | PCT_BY_BUCKET |
| **Engineering/PM Contingency** | 15% |
| **Rationale** | Moderate uncertainty due to: (1) RFP Section 7 requirements TBD, (2) Coordination with multiple deliverables (Appendix H), (3) Potential iteration cycles with Owner preferences |

**Decision Reference:** D-004

---

## Escalation Method

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Mode** | NONE |
| **Rationale** | Short-duration work (proposal phase); no escalation adjustment needed |

---

## Rounding Policy

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Rounding** | Nearest CAD $100 |
| **Rationale** | Appropriate precision for professional services estimate at Class 5/4 maturity |

---

## Completeness Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Lines priced by QUOTE** | 0% |
| **Lines priced by RATE_TABLE** | 0% |
| **Lines priced by ALLOWANCE** | 100% |
| **Deliverables with explicit quantities** | 100% (1 of 1) |
| **Confidence Level** | LOW-MEDIUM |

---

## Known Gaps

1. **No rate tables available** - All pricing based on allowance assumptions
2. **RFP Section 7 not accessible** - Detailed requirements marked TBD; may affect effort
3. **Appendix H dependency** - Consistency verification effort depends on Schedule A/B completeness
4. **Owner preferences unknown** - Reporting format/frequency may require iteration
5. **Effort estimates are parametric** - Based on typical proposal management scope, not detailed task breakdowns
