## 4. Scope Exclusions

The following are explicitly excluded from this estimate (per Decision D-008):

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Geotechnical investigation fieldwork | DEL-09-02 is summary document only; investigations are separate scope |
| Wetland assessment fieldwork | Investigations excluded per Specification scope exclusions |
| Environmental assessment (Phase I/II ESA) | Investigations excluded per Specification scope exclusions |
| Survey execution | Survey files available after award per Addendum 03 |
| Site grading design and civil engineering | Detailed design phase, not proposal |
| Wetland permitting applications | Post-award activity if required |
| Environmental remediation | Post-award activity if contamination found |
| Physical construction | Document deliverable only |
| Owner's costs | Standard exclusion |
| Land and financing | Standard exclusion |

---

## 5. Contracting Assumptions

| Assumption | Basis |
|------------|-------|
| Work performed by Design-Build proponent team | Proposal production context |
| Professional services on hourly basis | Allowance model per D-005 |
| Single production cycle with working sessions | A-010 |
| No external subconsultant markup included | Direct effort only |

---

## 6. Location and Productivity Assumptions

| Assumption | Basis |
|------------|-------|
| Work location | Alberta, Canada (office-based document production) |
| Productivity | Standard professional services productivity |
| No travel required | Remote/office work for document production |
| No field visits | DEL-09-02 is document summary, not investigation |

---

## 7. Pricing Sources Hierarchy

This estimate uses the following pricing hierarchy (per Protocol Phase 3.3):

| Priority | Source | Status | Usage |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Quotes/Vendor budgets | NOT AVAILABLE | Not used |
| 2 | Project rate tables | NOT AVAILABLE | Not used |
| 3 | Allowances (fallback model) | USED | 100% of line items |

**Decision Reference:** D-001, D-006

### Hourly Rates Applied (Fallback Model)

| Role | Rate (CAD/hr) | Basis |
|------|-------------:|-------|
| Project Manager | $175 | Alberta consulting market typical 2024-2026 |
| Senior Engineer | $150 | Alberta consulting market typical 2024-2026 |
| Engineer | $125 | Alberta consulting market typical 2024-2026 |
| Technical Support | $85 | Alberta consulting market typical 2024-2026 |

**Assumption Reference:** A-006

---

## 8. Indirects Model

| Item | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Indirects treatment | Embedded in hourly rates |
| Overhead | Included in professional rates |
| OH&P | Not explicitly separated |
| Temporary facilities | N/A (office-based work) |

**Rationale:** Professional services estimate uses fully-loaded hourly rates that include overhead and profit; no separate indirects calculation required.

---

## 9. Contingency Method and Rationale

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Method** | PCT_BY_BUCKET (Protocol default) |
| **Percentage Applied** | 15% |
| **Contingency Amount** | $2,787 CAD |

### Contingency Rationale

Higher than typical 10% contingency applied due to:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 100% allowance-based pricing | No firm quotes or rate tables |
| 50% LOW confidence assumptions | Significant uncertainty in effort estimates |
| Reference report accessibility (R-001) | Reports not directly reviewed; complexity unknown |
| Cross-deliverable coordination (R-002) | NOT_TRACKED dependency mode; coordination effort uncertain |
| Potential rework (R-004) | TBDs may resolve differently than assumed |
| Rate uncertainty (R-003) | Actual professional rates may differ from assumed |

**Decision Reference:** D-007

---

## 10. Escalation Method

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Escalation Mode** | NONE (default) |
| **Rationale** | Short-term proposal production; no escalation required |

---

## 11. Rounding Policy

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Rounding** | Nearest $1 CAD |
| **Summary rounding** | Nearest $1 CAD |
| **Rationale** | Appropriate precision for LOW confidence estimate |

---

## 12. Completeness Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| % deliverables with explicit quantities | 100% (effort hours derived from scope analysis) |
| Total line items | 29 |
| CBS buckets populated | 3 (E, PM, CONT) |

---

## 13. Known Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Resolution |
|-----|--------|------------|
| No rate tables available | All pricing is allowance-based | Provide `_Estimates/_RateTables/` with project rates |
| Reference reports not accessible | Report complexity unknown; effort estimated | Obtain accessible PDFs before production |
| No historical effort data | Cannot benchmark estimates | Track actual effort for future estimates |
| No quotes from consultants | Cannot validate rate assumptions | Obtain consultant proposals |

## 15. Estimate Quality Notes

### RUN_STATUS: WARNINGS

This estimate completed successfully but with the following warnings:

| Warning | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| W-001 | 100% allowance-based pricing; no quotes or rate tables available |
| W-002 | 50% of assumptions rated LOW confidence |
| W-003 | Reference reports documented as not accessible |
| W-004 | Cross-deliverable coordination complexity with NOT_TRACKED mode |

### Recommendations for Next Run

1. **Provide rate tables:** Add project-specific professional services rates to `_Estimates/_RateTables/`
2. **Obtain consultant quotes:** Request budgetary quotes for proposal production effort
3. **Access reference reports:** Ensure all 7 reference reports are accessible for review
4. **Track actual effort:** Log actual hours during DEL-09-02 production for benchmarking
