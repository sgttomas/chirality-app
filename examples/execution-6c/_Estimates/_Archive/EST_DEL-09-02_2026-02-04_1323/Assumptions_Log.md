## Assumption Register

### A-001: Reference Report Review Effort
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-001 |
| **Statement** | Each reference report (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood, subdivision) requires 4-8 hours of senior engineer review and extraction time |
| **Why Needed** | No actual time tracking data available; need basis for engineering hours |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / E (Engineering) |
| **Cost Impact** | 7 reports x 6 hrs avg x $150/hr = $6,300 |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Resolution Path** | Obtain actual effort data from similar past projects or contractor time tracking |

### A-002: Constraint-to-Mitigation Synthesis Effort
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-002 |
| **Statement** | Developing constraint-to-mitigation matrix and cross-deliverable integration requires 16-24 hours of PM/senior engineer time |
| **Why Needed** | No benchmark for synthesis effort; estimate based on anticipated artifact complexity |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / E, PM |
| **Cost Impact** | 20 hrs x $165/hr (blended) = $3,300 |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Resolution Path** | Track actual effort during proposal production |

### A-003: Site Characterization Narrative Effort
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-003 |
| **Statement** | Producing integrated site characterization narrative (R-15) requires 8-12 hours of senior professional time |
| **Why Needed** | Specification R-15 requires 1-2 page unified narrative synthesizing all disciplines |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / E |
| **Cost Impact** | 10 hrs x $150/hr = $1,500 |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Standard technical writing scope |

### A-004: Cross-Deliverable Coordination Effort
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-004 |
| **Statement** | Coordination with DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01 requires 12-16 hours of PM time |
| **Why Needed** | Procedure Step 6 and 6a require formal propagation and consistency verification |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / PM |
| **Cost Impact** | 14 hrs x $175/hr = $2,450 |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Resolution Path** | Track actual coordination effort; may vary by team structure |

### A-005: QA Review and Sign-off Effort
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-005 |
| **Statement** | Quality review, discipline sign-offs (Procedure Step 8a), and documentation finalization requires 8-12 hours |
| **Why Needed** | Specification requires multiple professional sign-offs per Compliance Accountability Matrix |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / PM, E |
| **Cost Impact** | 10 hrs x $160/hr (blended) = $1,600 |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Standard QA process scope |

### A-006: Professional Hourly Rates
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-006 |
| **Statement** | Professional services rates assumed: PM $175/hr, Senior Engineer $150/hr, Engineer $125/hr, Technical Support $85/hr (CAD, 2026 dollars) |
| **Why Needed** | No rate tables provided; typical Alberta consulting market rates applied |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | All E and PM line items |
| **Cost Impact** | Directly determines all labor-based costs |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Resolution Path** | Obtain actual contractor/consultant rates from proposal team |

### A-007: Documentation Production Effort
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-007 |
| **Statement** | Producing 7 anticipated artifacts (site summary, geotech findings, wetland map, environmental statement, flood statement, constraint matrix, survey assumptions) requires 16-20 hours of technical production |
| **Why Needed** | _CONTEXT.md lists 7 anticipated artifacts as deliverable outputs |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / E |
| **Cost Impact** | 18 hrs x $100/hr (blended tech/engineer) = $1,800 |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Track actual documentation production time |

### A-008: Verification and Consistency Checking
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-008 |
| **Statement** | Verification activities (Specification R-01 through R-12 verification methods) require 8-10 hours of engineer time |
| **Why Needed** | Specification defines extensive verification requirements including traceability matrix |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | DEL-09-02 / E |
| **Cost Impact** | 9 hrs x $125/hr = $1,125 |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Standard verification scope |

### A-009: No Physical Site Work Included
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-009 |
| **Statement** | DEL-09-02 is a document deliverable only; no physical site investigation, survey, or testing work included |
| **Why Needed** | Specification explicitly excludes actual investigation work; summary document scope only |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | Scope boundary definition |
| **Cost Impact** | Ensures no construction direct costs included |
| **Confidence** | HIGH |
| **Resolution Path** | N/A - Clear scope boundary from Specification |

### A-010: Single Production Cycle
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-010 |
| **Statement** | Estimate assumes one production cycle with working session revisions; no major scope rework |
| **Why Needed** | Need to bound effort estimate; extensive rework would increase costs |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | All effort-based items |
| **Cost Impact** | If rework required, could add 20-40% to effort |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Resolution Path** | Include contingency to cover potential rework |
