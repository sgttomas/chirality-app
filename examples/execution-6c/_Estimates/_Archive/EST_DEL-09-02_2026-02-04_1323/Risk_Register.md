## Risk Register

### R-001: Reference Report Inaccessibility
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope / Interface |
| **Cause** | 7 of 11 reference reports (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood, subdivision, RFP) are documented as "PDF not accessible" |
| **Consequence** | Effort to review and extract findings may be underestimated if reports are complex; or overestimated if reports are simple summaries |
| **Affected Buckets** | E (Engineering) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | PM to obtain accessible versions of all reference reports before starting deliverable production |
| **Contingency Handling** | 15% contingency applied to engineering effort to cover report complexity variance |

### R-002: Cross-Deliverable Coordination Complexity
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-002 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface / Schedule |
| **Cause** | DEL-09-02 must coordinate with 4 downstream deliverables (DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01) with NOT_TRACKED dependency mode |
| **Consequence** | Coordination effort may exceed estimate if deliverable teams are not aligned or if multiple revision cycles needed |
| **Affected Buckets** | PM (Project Management) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Early kickoff meeting with all downstream deliverable leads; establish terminology agreement before drafting |
| **Contingency Handling** | Coordination effort includes buffer; 15% contingency on PM time |

### R-003: Rate Uncertainty
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price |
| **Cause** | No project-specific rate tables available; using typical Alberta market rates as assumptions |
| **Consequence** | Actual professional rates may differ by +/- 20% from assumed rates |
| **Affected Buckets** | E, PM (all labor-based costs) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Obtain actual consultant/contractor rates during proposal stage |
| **Contingency Handling** | 15% contingency covers rate variance within typical range |

### R-004: Rework Due to TBD Resolution
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope / Productivity |
| **Cause** | Many datasheet values marked as TBD; if TBDs are resolved differently than assumed, document revisions needed |
| **Consequence** | Potential 20-40% increase in effort if significant rework required |
| **Affected Buckets** | E (Engineering) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Resolve TBDs early in production cycle; coordinate with PM on assumption validation |
| **Contingency Handling** | Rework allowance built into contingency |

### R-005: Discipline Sign-off Delays
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | Schedule |
| **Cause** | Procedure Step 8a requires sign-offs from environmental consultant, structural/geotechnical engineer, civil engineer |
| **Consequence** | Sign-off delays could extend schedule and require additional coordination effort |
| **Affected Buckets** | PM |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Schedule sign-off activities in proposal timeline; early engagement with sign-off authorities |
| **Contingency Handling** | PM time includes buffer for sign-off follow-up |

### R-006: Conflict Resolution Escalation
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-006 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface |
| **Cause** | CONF-001 (Flood zone area variance) identified; potential for additional conflicts when reference reports become accessible |
| **Consequence** | Conflict resolution may require RFI to Town, PM decision, or additional analysis effort |
| **Affected Buckets** | PM, E |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Proactive flood zone mapping review; early RFI if discrepancy confirmed |
| **Contingency Handling** | Small allowance for conflict resolution effort included |

## Contingency Calculation

### Method: PCT_BY_BUCKET (Default)
Per protocol, applying percentage-based contingency by CBS bucket with higher percentage for allowance-heavy estimate.

| CBS Bucket | Base Estimate (CAD) | Contingency % | Contingency (CAD) |
|------------|--------------------:|---------------|------------------:|
| E (Engineering) | $12,725 | 15% | $1,909 |
| PM (Project Management) | $5,350 | 15% | $803 |
| **Total Base** | **$18,075** | - | - |
| **Total Contingency** | - | - | **$2,712** |

### Contingency Rationale
- **15% selected** (higher than typical 10%) due to:
  - 100% allowance-based pricing (no quotes or rate tables)
  - 50% of assumptions rated LOW confidence
  - Reference report accessibility risk (R-001)
  - Cross-deliverable coordination complexity (R-002)
  - Potential rework from TBD resolution (R-004)
