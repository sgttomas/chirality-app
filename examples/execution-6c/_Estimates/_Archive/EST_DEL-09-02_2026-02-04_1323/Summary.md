## Key Cost Drivers

1. **Reference Report Review (29% of base):** Review and extraction from 7 reference reports (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, grading, flood, subdivision, RFP)

2. **Constraint Analysis & Mitigation (21% of base):** Identification of site constraints, impact assessment, and development of mitigation strategies per Specification R-11

3. **Cross-Deliverable Coordination (18% of base):** Coordination with DEL-02-01, DEL-05-03, DEL-09-01, DEL-08-01 per Procedure Step 6 and propagation protocol

4. **Site Characterization Narrative (8% of base):** Production of integrated 1-2 page narrative per Specification R-15

## Estimate Confidence Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Overall Confidence** | LOW |
| **Pricing Method** | 100% Allowance-based |
| Lines priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| Lines priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| Lines priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| Assumptions rated LOW confidence | 50% |
| Assumptions rated MEDIUM confidence | 40% |
| Assumptions rated HIGH confidence | 10% |

**Confidence Rationale:** No rate tables or quotes available. All pricing based on typical Alberta professional services rates and estimated effort by activity. Reference reports not directly accessible, so report complexity/extraction effort is assumed.

## Contingency Analysis

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Method | PCT_BY_BUCKET |
| Percentage Applied | 15% |
| Contingency Amount | $2,787 CAD |

**Contingency Justification:**
- 100% allowance-based pricing (no firm quotes)
- 50% LOW confidence assumptions
- Reference report accessibility risk
- Cross-deliverable coordination complexity
- Potential rework from TBD resolution
