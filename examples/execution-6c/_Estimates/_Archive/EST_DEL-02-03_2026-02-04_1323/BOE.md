## Scope Definition

### Deliverable Description
Production of a **Sustainability and Energy Narrative** (4-6 pages, 2,000-3,000 words) for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build proposal response. The narrative addresses energy efficiency strategies, solar-ready provisions (mandatory per Addendum 03), dual-function building zoning (Fire Hall 24/7 + Public Works scheduled), and life-cycle sustainability considerations.

### WBS Reference
- **Package:** PKG-04 Design Proposal (Concept + Design Brief)
- **Deliverable ID:** DEL-02-03
- **Deliverable Name:** SustainabilityAndEnergyNarrative
- **Discipline:** Architecture / Sustainability
- **Responsible Party:** Lead Architect / Designer

### Scope Traceability
- **Scope Items:** SOW-012 (Energy efficiency and sustainability approach narrative including solar-ready considerations)
- **Objectives:** OBJ-004 (Deliver strong Design Brief)
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Design Brief (5 points), Durability/Maintenance (15 points)

---

## Scope Inclusions

1. **Narrative Production**
   - Context review and requirements extraction (RFP, Addenda)
   - Technical content development (envelope, HVAC, electrical, solar-ready, water efficiency)
   - Code compliance statement drafting (ABC, NECB references)
   - Cross-document coordination (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-06-01, DEL-09-02)

2. **Solar-Ready Provisions Analysis**
   - Structural capacity provisions strategy
   - Electrical infrastructure provisions strategy
   - Roof orientation and configuration strategy
   - Future value and retrofit cost avoidance framing

3. **Technical Review and QA**
   - Self-review by narrative author
   - Code compliance review (Building Code Consultant)
   - Sustainability/energy specialist review (if available)
   - Cross-document consistency review (Proposal Manager/QA Lead)

4. **Optional Graphics/Diagrams**
   - HVAC Zoning Schematic (optional)
   - Solar-Ready Roof Plan (optional)
   - Building Envelope Section (optional)

5. **Compliance Mapping and Finalization**
   - Requirements verification against Specification.md
   - Compliance mapping table for DEL-01-01
   - Final formatting and delivery to Proposal Manager

---

## Scope Exclusions

1. **Detailed Energy Modeling** - Not required at proposal stage
2. **Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) Spreadsheets** - Qualitative framing only
3. **Equipment Schedules/Specifications** - Deferred to detailed design
4. **Third-Party Certifications (LEED)** - Not required unless specified in RFP
5. **Commissioning Procedures** - Covered in DEL-06-01
6. **Construction Methodology** - Covered in DEL-04-01
7. **Detailed Engineering Calculations** - Conceptual/proposal stage only

## Estimate Basis

### Pricing Sources Hierarchy
1. **Quotes/Vendor Budgets:** Not applicable (narrative document)
2. **Rate Tables:** Not available in `_RateTables/`
3. **Allowances:** Primary basis (see Assumptions_Log.md for A-### entries)

### CBS Assignment
This deliverable maps to **Engineering & Design (E)** in the Cost Breakdown Structure, specifically:
- Professional services for narrative document production
- Technical specialist review and consultation
- Graphics/diagram preparation

### Pricing Assumptions
- All pricing based on allowances for professional services effort
- Hourly rates assumed based on typical Alberta market for:
  - Lead Architect/Designer: $150-180/hr
  - Sustainability Specialist: $140-160/hr
  - Building Code Consultant: $160-180/hr
  - Graphics Support: $80-100/hr
  - Proposal Manager/QA: $120-140/hr
- Effort estimates based on typical Design Brief narrative complexity

### Indirects Model
- Factor-based: 15% markup on professional services for project overhead, administration, and coordination
- Applied to subtotal of direct professional services

### Contingency Method
- **Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET
- **Rationale:** 20% contingency on Engineering & Design bucket (allowance-based estimate with moderate uncertainty)
- Higher contingency reflects:
  - Early project stage (proposal phase)
  - Allowance-based pricing (no rate tables)
  - Potential scope refinement during production

### Escalation
- **Mode:** NONE
- **Rationale:** Short duration deliverable (proposal phase); no escalation applied

### Rounding
- Nearest $100 CAD for line items
- Nearest $1,000 CAD for summary totals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % Lines Priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % Lines Priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % Lines Priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| % Deliverables with Explicit Quantities | 0% (effort-based) |
| Confidence Level | LOW-MED |

---

## Known Gaps

1. **Rate Tables Not Available** - All pricing based on allowances; actual rates may vary
2. **Scope Refinement Risk** - Narrative complexity may increase if RFP requirements exceed assumptions
3. **Cross-Document Coordination Effort** - Depends on status of upstream deliverables (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02)
4. **Optional Graphics Scope** - Diagrams included as allowance; may be reduced or expanded based on proposal strategy
5. **Code Edition Uncertainty** - ABC/NECB edition not confirmed; may affect review effort
