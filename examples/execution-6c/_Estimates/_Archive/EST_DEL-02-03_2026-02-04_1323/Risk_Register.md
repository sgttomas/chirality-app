## Risk Entries

### R-001: Scope Creep - Expanded Narrative Requirements
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope |
| **Cause** | RFP requirements exceed assumptions; additional topics required; increased technical depth |
| **Consequence** | Increased effort for drafting and review; longer narrative; additional graphics |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E / DEL-02-03 |
| **Probability** | Medium (30%) |
| **Impact** | +$2,000-4,000 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Early RFP review to confirm scope; establish page limit agreement with Proposal Manager |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency reserve; escalate if requirements significantly exceed 6 pages |

---

### R-002: Upstream Deliverable Delays
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-002 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface/Schedule |
| **Cause** | DEL-02-01 (Concept Design) or DEL-02-02 (Design Brief) not available for coordination |
| **Consequence** | Increased rework for alignment; TBD items remain unresolved; coordination effort increases |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E / DEL-02-03 |
| **Probability** | Medium (40%) |
| **Impact** | +$500-1,500 CAD additional coordination |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Proceed with assumptions; coordinate timing with Proposal Manager; use placeholder cross-references |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency reserve |

---

### R-003: Code Edition Uncertainty
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope/Compliance |
| **Cause** | ABC/NECB code edition not confirmed; values may differ between editions |
| **Consequence** | Additional code consultant review effort; potential rework of compliance statements |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E / DEL-02-03 (Code Consultant Review) |
| **Probability** | Low-Medium (25%) |
| **Impact** | +$500-1,000 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Confirm code editions from RFP Appendix A early; use conservative assumptions |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency reserve |

---

### R-004: Optional Graphics Reduction
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope (Opportunity) |
| **Cause** | File size constraints; Proposal Manager decision to use text-only approach |
| **Consequence** | Reduced graphics effort; cost savings |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E / DEL-02-03 (Graphics) |
| **Probability** | Medium (35%) |
| **Impact** | -$1,000-1,800 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Confirm diagram scope before production; prepare text-only alternative |
| **Contingency Handling** | Potential cost reduction if diagrams eliminated |

---

### R-005: Rate Variance from Market
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price |
| **Cause** | Assumed hourly rates may differ from actual contract rates or market conditions |
| **Consequence** | Actual costs higher or lower than estimated |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | All direct services |
| **Probability** | Medium (40%) |
| **Impact** | +/- 15% on labor costs ($1,300 CAD) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Obtain actual rate schedules for future estimates; update _RateTables/ |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency reserve |

## Contingency Adequacy Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Base Estimate** | $10,100 CAD |
| **Contingency Applied** | $2,020 CAD (20%) |
| **Identified Risk Exposure** | $3,000-6,000 CAD (gross) |
| **Risk-Adjusted Exposure** | ~$2,500 CAD (probability-weighted) |
| **Contingency Adequacy** | ADEQUATE - 20% covers expected risk exposure |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Confirm RFP scope early** - Review RFP Appendix A and Section 7.1 to validate narrative scope assumptions
2. **Coordinate diagram decision** - Confirm with Proposal Manager whether diagrams add sufficient value vs. file size
3. **Obtain rate tables** - For future estimates, populate `_RateTables/` with project-specific rates
4. **Track actual effort** - Benchmark this deliverable's actual hours vs. estimate for future calibration
