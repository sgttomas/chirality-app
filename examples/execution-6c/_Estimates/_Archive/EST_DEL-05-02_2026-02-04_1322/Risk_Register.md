## Risk Register

### R-001: Building Scope Uncertainty
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | SCOPE |
| **Cause** | DEL-02-01 Concept Design not complete; building area and systems TBD |

| **Impact** | MED (potential $200-500K variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Obtain geotechnical report; complete site survey |
| **Contingency Handling** | 15% contingency on sitework; service tie-in allowance per Addendum 03 |

---

### R-003: Utility Connection Uncertainty
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | SCOPE / INTERFACE |
| **Cause** | Existing utility locations and connection requirements not confirmed |
| **Consequence** | Service tie-in costs may exceed allowance |
| **Affected CBS** | Sitework (SW) - Utilities |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-02 |
| **Probability** | MED |
| **Impact** | MED (potential $100-300K variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Utility locates; coordination with Town utility departments |
| **Contingency Handling** | Allowance approach per Addendum 03 (OI-003); $400K utility allowance |

---

### R-004: Addendum 03 Technical Requirements
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | SCOPE |
| **Cause** | Addendum 03 technical items (overhead doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-ready) scope not fully defined |
| **Consequence** | Actual requirements may exceed estimated allowances |
| **Affected CBS** | Building (B) - Mechanical, Electrical, Specialties |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-02 |
| **Probability** | MED |
| **Impact** | MED (potential $100-300K variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Clarify technical requirements with Design Lead; review Addendum 03 in detail |
| **Contingency Handling** | Costs embedded in building system allowances |

---

### R-005: Additional Options Scope Creep
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | SCOPE |
| **Cause** | Options 1-6 scope not fully defined; Owner expectations may exceed assumptions |
| **Consequence** | Option costs may exceed allowances if scope expands |
| **Affected CBS** | Options (OPT) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-02 |
| **Probability** | MED |
| **Impact** | LOW (potential $50-150K variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Clarify option scope with Owner during proposal clarifications |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency on options assumed in allowance amounts |

---

### R-006: Market Escalation
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-006 |
| **Risk Driver** | PRICE |
| **Cause** | Alberta construction market volatility; material price fluctuations |
| **Consequence** | Actual costs at time of construction may exceed estimate |
| **Affected CBS** | All |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-02 |
| **Probability** | MED |
| **Impact** | MED (potential 5-10% variance) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Monitor market; consider escalation clause in contract |
| **Contingency Handling** | Escalation mode set to NONE; assume captured in contingency |

---

### R-007: Labor Availability
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-007 |
| **Risk Driver** | PRODUCTIVITY |
| **Cause** | Alberta labor market conditions; skilled trade availability |
| **Consequence** | Labor shortages may increase costs or delay schedule |
| **Affected CBS** | Building (B), Sitework (SW) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-02 |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | MED (potential productivity loss) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Early subcontractor engagement; workforce planning |
| **Contingency Handling** | Rates assume competitive market; contingency buffer |

---

### R-008: Schedule A/B Reconciliation Failure
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-008 |
| **Risk Driver** | INTERFACE |
| **Cause** | Schedule B costs must reconcile to Schedule A totals (R-005 requirement) |
| **Consequence** | If not reconciled, proposal may be non-compliant |
| **Affected CBS** | All |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-02/DEL-05-02, DEL-05-01 |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | HIGH (potential disqualification) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Use linked formulas; perform independent QA check |
| **Contingency Handling** | QA verification step in Procedure.md Step 4 |

## Risk Summary

| Risk Level | Count | Total Exposure (Est.) |
|------------|-------|----------------------|
| HIGH | 1 | $1-2M |
| MED | 6 | $500K-1.5M |
| LOW | 1 | N/A (compliance) |
| **Total** | **8** | **$1.5-3.5M potential variance** |

## Contingency Allocation

| CBS Category | Base Cost | Contingency % | Contingency $ | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| General Requirements | $450,000 | 5% | $22,500 | Lower uncertainty |
| Building | $5,200,000 | 10% | $520,000 | Scope uncertainty |
| Sitework | $1,225,000 | 15% | $183,750 | Site conditions unknown |
| Options | $280,000 | 10% | $28,000 | Scope not defined |
| **Total** | **$7,155,000** | **10.5% avg** | **$754,250** | |

**Note:** Contingency applied as single line item ($598,000) representing approximately 8.7% of direct construction base. Risk register suggests higher contingency may be warranted given LOW confidence level.
