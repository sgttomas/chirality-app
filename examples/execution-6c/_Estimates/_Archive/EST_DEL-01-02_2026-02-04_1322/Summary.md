## Known Gaps and Warnings

1. **No rate tables available** — All pricing is allowance-based; recommend providing rate tables for future estimates
2. **TBD items in deliverable documents** — Submission email address, RFP heading structure, execution requirements not fully specified
3. **Effort estimates based on judgment** — No historical baseline for comparison
4. **Upstream deliverables excluded** — This estimate covers DEL-01-02 only; total proposal cost requires aggregation of all DEL-* estimates

## Recommendations for Next Run

1. **Add rate tables** — Provide `_RateTables/` with Proposal Manager, Admin, and Graphics Coordinator hourly rates
2. **Resolve TBD items** — Update source documents with confirmed submission address, RFP heading structure
3. **Capture actuals** — After proposal submission, compare actual effort to this estimate for calibration
