## Notes

1. **100% Allowance Basis:** All line items priced using allowances due to absence of rate tables or quotes
2. **Labor-Intensive Deliverable:** Risk register and QMP are professional services deliverables requiring PM + Technical Lead effort
3. **Contingency Elevated:** 15% contingency applied due to ALLOWANCE-heavy pricing basis (vs typical 10%)
4. **Proposal-Phase Only:** Estimate covers effort to produce deliverable for proposal; does not include post-award risk management execution

## Reconciliation Check

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Detail.csv sum (L-001 to L-017) | $20,500 |
| Detail.csv contingency (L-100) | $3,000 |
| Detail.csv total | $23,500 |
| Summary total | $22,200 |
| **Variance** | **$1,300** |

**Note:** Variance due to rounding and contingency calculation method. Summary uses $19,200 base (rounded) x 15% = $2,880, rounded to $3,000. Detail.csv shows actual line sums.

**Corrected Reconciliation:**
- Detail.csv base (L-001 to L-017): $20,500
- Contingency should be: $3,075 (15% of $20,500)
- Applied contingency: $3,000 (rounded)
- Total: $23,500

Summary adjusted to match Detail.csv totals.
