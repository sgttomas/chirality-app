## Notes

1. **This estimate covers administrative/compliance effort only** - not actual bond premiums (which are project-level costs in DEL-05-01/02 pricing deliverables)

2. **Multiple TBD items unresolved** - RFP Section 5.3.1 requirements not extracted; insurance scope conditional

3. **Confidence Level: MEDIUM** - Reasonable basis for typical Alberta Design-Build proposal compliance work, but specific RFP requirements unknown

4. **Bond premium costs are EXCLUDED** - This deliverable covers the administrative work to produce bonding evidence, not the actual bond premium (typically 1-3% of contract value)
