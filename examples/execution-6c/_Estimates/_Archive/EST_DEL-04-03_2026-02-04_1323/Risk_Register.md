## Risk Register

### R-001: Effort Estimation Uncertainty

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | Quantity / Productivity |
| **Cause** | No historical effort data for comparable communications plan development |
| **Consequence** | Actual effort may exceed estimates; cost overrun on this deliverable |
| **Affected CBS** | E (Engineering), PM (Project Management) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-06, DEL-04-03 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | LOW-MEDIUM (CAD 1,000 - 2,000 potential overrun) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Track actual effort during development; use for future estimate calibration |
| **Contingency Handling** | 15% contingency applied to base estimate |

---

### R-002: Cross-Deliverable Inconsistency Rework

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-002 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface / Scope |
| **Cause** | Adjacent deliverables (DEL-04-01, 04-02, 03-01, 06-01) may define conflicting meeting frequencies or communication protocols |
| **Consequence** | Rework required to harmonize communications plan with other deliverables |
| **Affected CBS** | E (Engineering) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-06, DEL-04-03 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | LOW (CAD 400 - 800 potential rework) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Early coordination with adjacent deliverable authors; parallel development where possible |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in base contingency |

### R-003: Owner Preference Changes at Kickoff

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope |
| **Cause** | Communications plan uses "proposed" frequencies pending Owner confirmation; Owner may require significant modifications |
| **Consequence** | Post-award rework to revise plan per Owner preferences (not part of proposal estimate) |
| **Affected CBS** | N/A (post-award) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-06, DEL-04-03 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | N/A (post-award scope) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Maintain flexibility in plan language; use "proposed" terminology consistently |
| **Contingency Handling** | Not costed in proposal estimate; addressed in execution phase budget |

---

### R-004: RFP Requirements Discovery

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope |
| **Cause** | RFP Section 7.3.4 content not fully accessible; specific requirements may add scope |
| **Consequence** | Additional plan sections required to address undiscovered RFP requirements |
| **Affected CBS** | E (Engineering) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-06, DEL-04-03 |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | LOW-MEDIUM (CAD 500 - 1,000 potential additional scope) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Review full RFP Section 7.3.4 when accessible; allocate buffer for additional requirements |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in base contingency |

---

### R-005: Visual Artifact Complexity

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | Productivity |
| **Cause** | 3 visual artifacts (diagrams/flowcharts) may require more effort than estimated if professional graphics required |
| **Consequence** | Additional effort or external graphics support needed |
| **Affected CBS** | E (Engineering) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-06, DEL-04-03 (L-016) |
| **Probability** | LOW-MEDIUM |
| **Impact** | LOW (CAD 300 - 600 potential additional cost) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Use simple, clear diagrams; leverage existing templates if available |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in base contingency |

---

### R-006: Stakeholder Complexity Underestimation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-006 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope |
| **Cause** | 8 stakeholder groups identified may have more complex communication requirements than estimated |
| **Consequence** | Additional tailoring of communication protocols per stakeholder group |
| **Affected CBS** | E (Engineering) |
| **Affected WBS** | PKG-06, DEL-04-03 |
| **Probability** | LOW |
| **Impact** | LOW (CAD 200 - 400 potential additional scope) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Use stakeholder grouping to manage complexity; avoid over-customization |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in base contingency |

## Contingency Summary

| Method | PCT_BY_BUCKET |
|--------|---------------|
| **Base Estimate** | CAD 8,620 |
| **Contingency Rate** | 15% |
| **Contingency Amount** | CAD 1,300 |
| **Total with Contingency** | CAD 9,920 |

### Contingency Allocation Rationale

| Risk Category | Coverage |
|---------------|----------|
| **Effort uncertainty (R-001)** | Primary driver; 100% ALLOWANCE pricing |
| **Cross-deliverable rework (R-002)** | Moderate likelihood; included in base contingency |
| **RFP scope discovery (R-004)** | Low likelihood; included in base contingency |
| **Visual artifact complexity (R-005)** | Low-moderate likelihood; included in base contingency |
| **Stakeholder complexity (R-006)** | Low likelihood; included in base contingency |
