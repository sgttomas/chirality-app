1. **Communications Plan Development** - Creating comprehensive communications and reporting plan
   - Communication protocols between Design-Builder and Owner (Town of Penhold)
   - Meeting structure (kickoff, design progress, construction progress, commissioning coordination)
   - Reporting cadence (progress reports, meeting minutes, change order logs, RFI logs, safety reports)
   - Stakeholder identification and communication touchpoints
   - Escalation paths for critical decisions and safety incidents

2. **Reporting Artifacts Definition** - 6 artifact types documented:
   - Progress Reports (monthly)
   - Meeting Minutes (per meeting)
   - Change Order Log (monthly updates)
   - RFI Log (weekly updates)

   - Subconsultants / Subtrades
   - Authorities Having Jurisdiction
   - Town Fire Department Operations Staff
   - Town Public Works Operations Staff

4. **Performance Metrics (KPIs)** - 6 communication KPIs defined

5. **Infrastructure Readiness Planning** - 7 infrastructure components identified

6. **12 Requirements Addressed** - REQ-COMM-001 through REQ-COMM-012

### Excluded Scope

## Contracting Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Proposal Manager hourly rate** | CAD $150/hr | A-001 (Professional rate allowance) |
| **Construction Manager hourly rate** | CAD $140/hr | A-002 (Responsible party rate) |
| **Project Controls Specialist rate** | CAD $100/hr | A-003 (Technical staff rate allowance) |
| **Labour basis** | Fully burdened rates | A-004 |
| **Overhead/markup** | Included in hourly rates | A-004 |

---

## Location / Productivity Assumptions

| Factor | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Work location** | Office-based | Proposal development work |
| **Productivity factor** | 1.0 (standard) | No site or remote work adjustments |
| **Working hours** | 8 hrs/day | Standard office day |

---

## Pricing Sources Hierarchy

This estimate uses the following pricing hierarchy (per AGENT_ESTIMATING protocol):

1. **QUOTE** - Not available (no vendor quotes for professional services)
2. **RATE_TABLE** - Not available (_RateTables/ folder is empty)
3. **ALLOWANCE** - Used for all pricing (see Assumptions_Log.md)

**Pricing Method Distribution:**
- ALLOWANCE: 100%
- RATE_TABLE: 0%
- QUOTE: 0%

---

## Indirects Model

This is a professional services / proposal management deliverable. Indirects are embedded in the fully-burdened hourly rates. No separate construction indirects apply.

---

## Contingency Method and Rationale

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Method** | PCT_BY_BUCKET |
| **Engineering/PM Contingency** | 15% |
| **Rationale** | Moderate uncertainty in effort due to: (1) 12 requirements to address, (2) cross-deliverable consistency checks required, (3) Owner/stakeholder complexity |

**Decision Reference:** D-004

---

## Escalation Method

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Mode** | NONE |
| **Rationale** | Short-duration work (proposal phase); no escalation adjustment needed |

---

## Rounding Policy

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Rounding** | Nearest CAD $100 |
| **Rationale** | Appropriate precision for professional services estimate at Class 5/4 maturity |

---

## Completeness Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Lines priced by QUOTE** | 0% |
| **Lines priced by RATE_TABLE** | 0% |
| **Lines priced by ALLOWANCE** | 100% |
| **Deliverables with explicit quantities** | 100% (1 of 1) |
| **Confidence Level** | LOW-MEDIUM |

---

## Known Gaps

1. **No rate tables available** - All pricing based on allowance assumptions
2. **Effort estimates are parametric** - Based on typical proposal communications plan scope, not detailed task breakdowns
3. **Cross-deliverable integration effort estimated** - Alignment with DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, DEL-03-01, DEL-06-01 based on typical coordination level
4. **Visual artifact creation** - Meeting structure diagram, reporting cadence timeline, escalation flowchart effort estimated at allowance level
