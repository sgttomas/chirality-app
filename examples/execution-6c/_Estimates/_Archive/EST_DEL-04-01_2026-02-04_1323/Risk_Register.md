## Risk Register

### R-001: Rate Uncertainty

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | Price uncertainty |
| **Cause** | No rate tables available; blended rate assumption used |
| **Consequence** | Actual labor costs may differ from estimate if actual rates vary from $175/hr assumption |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | All labor line items / PKG-06/DEL-04-01 |
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Impact** | Low-Medium (professional services rates relatively stable) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Provide role-specific rate tables in `_RateTables/` for future estimates; track actual rates for calibration |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency partially covers rate variance |

### R-002: Scope Creep - Additional Review Cycles

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-002 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | Narrative may require additional review cycles beyond assumed 1-2 cycles |
| **Consequence** | Additional labor hours for revision and re-review; potential schedule impact |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | Engineering (E) / PKG-06/DEL-04-01 |
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Impact** | Medium (8-16 hours per additional cycle at $175/hr = $1,400-$2,800) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Establish clear review criteria before starting; limit review cycle count contractually |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency partially covers additional review effort |

---

### R-003: Reference Document Complexity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | Quantity/scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | Site reference documents (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, flood, grading) not fully accessed; actual complexity unknown |
| **Consequence** | Review effort may exceed 12 hours if documents are lengthy or complex |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | Engineering (E) / PKG-06/DEL-04-01 |
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Impact** | Low (4-8 additional hours = $700-$1,400) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Access reference documents early; assess complexity before finalizing estimate |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency covers moderate complexity variance |

---

### R-004: Cross-Deliverable Coordination Delays

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface/dependency |
| **Cause** | Dependencies on DEL-02-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-02, DEL-05-03 may cause coordination delays |
| **Consequence** | Narrative completion delayed; potential rework if upstream deliverables change |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | PM / PKG-06/DEL-04-01 |
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Impact** | Medium (schedule delay risk; 8-16 hours additional coordination) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Schedule coordination sessions early; use parallel development with synchronization checkpoints |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency partially covers additional coordination effort |

---

### R-005: RFP Compliance Gap Discovery

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | RFP Section 7.2 not fully read; additional requirements may be discovered |
| **Consequence** | Additional narrative content required; potential rework |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | Engineering (E) / PKG-06/DEL-04-01 |
| **Likelihood** | Low-Medium |
| **Impact** | Medium (8-16 hours additional authoring = $1,400-$2,800) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Read RFP Section 7.2 thoroughly before drafting; create compliance checklist per Procedure Step 0 |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency covers moderate compliance gap rework |

---

### R-006: Supporting Exhibits Complexity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-006 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | Site logistics diagram and phasing diagram complexity may exceed allowance |
| **Consequence** | Additional drafting/graphic design effort required |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | Engineering (E) / PKG-06/DEL-04-01 |
| **Likelihood** | Low |
| **Impact** | Low ($400-$800 additional) |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Define exhibit scope and level of detail early; use standard diagram templates |
| **Contingency Handling** | 10% contingency covers exhibit complexity variance |

## Contingency Summary

| Method | Application | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| PCT_BY_BUCKET | 10% of base estimate | $1,925.00 |
| Risk-Based Adjustment | Not applied (default method used) | N/A |

### Contingency Rationale
- Professional services work with defined scope
- Moderate uncertainty in rate assumptions and scope complexity
- Low-medium risk profile for narrative document production
- 10% contingency appropriate for this estimate class

**Decision Reference:** D-006
