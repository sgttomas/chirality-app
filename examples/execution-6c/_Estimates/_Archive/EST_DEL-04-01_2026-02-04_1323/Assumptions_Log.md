## Assumptions Register

### A-001: Standard Professional Services Productivity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-001 |
| **Statement** | Productivity assumed at standard professional services rates for proposal development work in Alberta |
| **Why Needed** | No historical productivity data available for this specific deliverable type |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Engineering & Design (E) |
| **Cost Impact** | Moderate; productivity affects total hours required |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Track actual hours during deliverable production; update estimate model with actuals for future runs |

### A-002: Moderate Document Complexity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-002 |
| **Statement** | Effort estimates assume moderate-high document complexity based on analysis of four documents |
| **Why Needed** | Detailed site reference documents and RFP Section 7.2 not fully accessed; complexity inferred from available information |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Engineering & Design (E) |
| **Cost Impact** | High; complexity drives total effort hours |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Read full RFP Section 7.2 and site reference documents to validate complexity assessment |

### A-003: Construction Manager as Primary Author

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-003 |
| **Statement** | Construction Manager is primary author; other roles provide review and coordination support |
| **Why Needed** | Role allocation affects effort distribution and cost |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Engineering & Design (E) |
| **Cost Impact** | Moderate; CM labor is primary cost driver |
| **Confidence** | HIGH |
| **Resolution Path** | Confirm role allocation with project team |

---

### A-004: Single Review Cycle Assumption

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-004 |
| **Statement** | Estimate assumes 1-2 review cycles per Procedure.md guidance; additional cycles would increase effort |
| **Why Needed** | Review cycles affect total effort hours |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Engineering & Design (E) |
| **Cost Impact** | Moderate; each additional review cycle adds approximately 8-16 hours |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Track actual review cycles; adjust estimate model if pattern differs |

---

### A-005: Cross-Deliverable Coordination Effort

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-005 |
| **Statement** | Cross-deliverable coordination assumed at 16 hours for alignment with DEL-02-01, DEL-08-01, DEL-09-02, DEL-05-03 |
| **Why Needed** | Procedure Step 3 requires coordination; effort not specified |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Project Management (PM) |
| **Cost Impact** | Moderate; coordination effort adds to base authoring hours |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Track actual coordination hours; adjust for future estimates |

---

### A-006: Site Reference Document Review Effort

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-006 |
| **Statement** | Site reference document review (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, flood, grading, adjacent development) assumed at 12 hours total |
| **Why Needed** | Procedure Step 2 requires reference document review; document volumes and complexity unknown |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Engineering & Design (E) |
| **Cost Impact** | Low-Moderate; review effort is enabling work for narrative drafting |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Resolution Path** | Read reference documents and assess actual review effort required |

---

### A-007: Blended Hourly Rate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-007 |
| **Statement** | Blended hourly rate of $175/hr CAD assumed for all professional services labor |
| **Why Needed** | No role-specific rate tables available |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | All labor line items |
| **Cost Impact** | High; rate assumption is primary cost driver |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Provide role-specific hourly rates (CM, PM, Safety Lead, Architect, Scheduler, Estimator) for improved accuracy |

---

### A-008: Narrative Length and Format

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assumption ID** | A-008 |
| **Statement** | Narrative assumed to be 8-12 pages of technical content with supporting exhibits (site logistics diagram, phasing diagram) |
| **Why Needed** | Page count affects authoring effort |
| **Impacted WBS/CBS** | PKG-06 / DEL-04-01; Engineering & Design (E) |
| **Cost Impact** | Moderate; longer narrative requires more authoring hours |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Resolution Path** | Verify RFP Section 7.2 page limit guidance; adjust estimate if significantly different |
