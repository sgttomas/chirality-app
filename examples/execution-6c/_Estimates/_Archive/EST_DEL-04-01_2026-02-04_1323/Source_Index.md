## Pricing Basis Selection

| Selection | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Method:** ALLOWANCE | No rate tables or vendor quotes available in `_RateTables/` directory |
| **Rate Basis:** $175/hr CAD blended | Industry typical for construction management/proposal development in Alberta |
| **Effort Basis:** 102 hours | Derived from Procedure.md steps and Specification.md requirements complexity |

**Decision Reference:** D-003, D-004, D-009
