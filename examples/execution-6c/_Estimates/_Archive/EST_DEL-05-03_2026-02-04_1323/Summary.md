## Key Assumptions Affecting Total

| ID | Assumption | Cost Impact |
|---|---|---|
| A-001 | Fixed-price Design-Build proposal context | Defines deliverable scope |
| A-002 | Professional services rate ~$150/hr assumed | Drives all narrative production line items |
| A-003 | Value alternatives may be minimal or omitted | Section 7 cost could be reduced or eliminated |
| A-004 | Schedules A/B available for cross-reference | If unavailable, reduces effort |
| A-005 | Related deliverables available for cross-check | If unavailable, reduces effort |

---

## Key Risks Affecting Total

| ID | Risk | Potential Impact |
|---|---|---|
| R-001 | No rate tables available | 100% allowance-based; potential +/- 30% variance |
| R-002 | Multiple TBD items in source documents | Actual effort may differ significantly |
| R-003 | Scope creep on value alternatives | Could increase Section 7 effort |
| R-004 | Cross-deliverable delays | May require rework or deferred completion |

## Notes

1. This estimate covers **professional services effort only** to produce the Pricing Narrative and Assumptions document
2. All pricing is based on **allowances** due to absence of rate tables
3. Effort estimates assume **~65-80 professional hours** at approximately $150/hr average blended rate
4. Actual effort will depend on:
   - Availability of Schedules A/B for cross-reference
   - Clarity of estimator input on TBD items
   - Extent of value alternatives to be documented
   - Number of review/revision cycles required
