# Risk Register

## Purpose
This register documents risks identified during estimate generation for DEL-07-01 and their impact on contingency.

---

## R-001: RFP Requirements Complexity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-001 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | RFP Section 7.1.6 not accessible; content requirements assumed from Specification |
| **Consequence** | Actual RFP may require additional content, specific format, or more extensive documentation |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E, PM / PKG-03, DEL-07-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM (40%) |
| **Impact Range** | +$500 to +$2,000 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Obtain RFP access early; review Section 7.1.6 before detailed drafting |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency factor; may require revision if RFP shows significantly different scope |

## R-002: Insufficient Comparable Projects

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-002 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty; data availability |
| **Cause** | Firm project database not verified; may have fewer than 3-5 comparable Design-Build projects |
| **Consequence** | Need to develop narrative around limited experience; potential inclusion of less-comparable projects requiring more explanation |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E / PKG-03, DEL-07-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM (30%) |
| **Impact Range** | +$500 to +$1,500 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Verify project database early; identify backup projects if needed |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency factor |

---

## R-003: Reference Verification Difficulties

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-003 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface; data availability |
| **Cause** | Client references may be unavailable, contact info outdated, or unwilling to participate |
| **Consequence** | Additional effort to find alternative references; potential delay; may need to brief references more extensively |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | PM / PKG-03, DEL-07-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM (35%) |
| **Impact Range** | +$300 to +$800 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Contact references early in proposal development; have backup references identified |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency factor |

---

## R-004: Multiple Revision Cycles

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-004 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope; productivity |
| **Cause** | Technical review or executive review may require substantial revisions beyond 2 cycles assumed |
| **Consequence** | Additional labor hours for revisions and re-review |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E, PM / PKG-03, DEL-07-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM (40%) |
| **Impact Range** | +$500 to +$1,500 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Establish clear review criteria upfront; address reviewer concerns early |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency factor |

---

## R-005: Cross-Deliverable Coordination Issues

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-005 |
| **Risk Driver** | Interface |
| **Cause** | DEL-07-02 (team resumes) and DEL-07-03 (subtrade list) may develop inconsistencies with DEL-07-01 |
| **Consequence** | Additional coordination effort; potential rework to align all three deliverables |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | PM / PKG-03, DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-07-03 |
| **Probability** | LOW (25%) |
| **Impact Range** | +$300 to +$600 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Per Procedure Step 2, establish team qualifications matrix and coordination checkpoints |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency factor |

---

## R-006: OSR Tailoring Requires Extensive Rework

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Risk ID** | R-006 |
| **Risk Driver** | Scope uncertainty |
| **Cause** | OSR (Appendix A) not accessible; assumed priorities may not match actual owner priorities |
| **Consequence** | Once OSR is available, significant rewrite may be needed to properly tailor content |
| **Affected CBS/WBS** | E / PKG-03, DEL-07-01 |
| **Probability** | MEDIUM (35%) |
| **Impact Range** | +$500 to +$1,200 CAD |
| **Suggested Mitigation** | Obtain OSR access early; draft with flexible narrative that can be adapted |
| **Contingency Handling** | Included in 20% contingency factor |

## Contingency Summary

| Method | PCT_BY_BUCKET |
|--------|---------------|
| **Base Estimate** | $9,600 CAD |
| **Contingency Rate** | 20% |
| **Contingency Amount** | $1,920 CAD |
| **Total with Contingency** | $11,520 CAD |

### Contingency Rationale
- 100% allowance-based pricing (no quotes or rate tables)
- RFP requirements not verified (TBD)
- Firm data availability not confirmed
- Multiple medium-probability risks identified
- LOW overall confidence rating
