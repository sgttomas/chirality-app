## 3. Pricing Sources Hierarchy

2. **RATE_TABLE:** Not available - _RateTables/ directory is empty
3. **ALLOWANCE:** Primary method used for all line items

**Assumption A-003:** Personnel providing resume content do so as part of normal duties (not separately costed)

---

## 5. Location and Productivity Assumptions

**Assumption A-004:** Office-based professional work; no field productivity factors apply
**Assumption A-005:** Standard professional labor productivity (8-hour days, 85% productivity factor for administrative overhead)

## 6. Quantities and Cost Drivers

### 6.1 Primary Quantity Drivers
| Driver | Quantity | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Key team members (base) | 9 | Datasheet.md Section 2.5 - typical roles list |
| Key team members (high) | 13 | Datasheet.md Section 2.5 - including potential additional roles |
| Pages per resume (max) | 2 | RFP Section 7.1.7; Specification.md REQ-07-02-04 |
| Cross-deliverable checks | 3 | DEL-07-01, DEL-07-03, DEL-08-01 per Procedure.md Step 6 |
| QA review cycles | 1 | Assumed single QA pass; Procedure.md Step 7 |

### 6.2 Selected Quantity Basis
**Decision D-003:** Estimated 10 key team members as base case (midpoint between 9 typical and 13 expanded)

---

## 7. Indirects Model

**Method:** Factor-based (percentage of direct labor)
**Factor:** 15% of direct labor costs for indirect activities
**Rationale:** Standard proposal preparation overhead for coordination, document management, and administrative support

---

## 8. Contingency Method and Rationale

**Method:** PCT_BY_BUCKET (percentage by CBS category)
**Contingency Rate:** 20% on ALLOWANCE-priced items
**Rationale:**
- All line items are ALLOWANCE-priced (no quotes or rate tables)
- Scope uncertainty exists regarding number of key members (TBD in documents)
- Resume content gathering effort depends on personnel responsiveness
- Higher contingency warranted due to 100% ALLOWANCE pricing

**Decision:** D-004 (see Decision_Log.md)

---

## 9. Escalation Method

**Mode:** NONE (disabled)
**Rationale:** Proposal preparation work is near-term (within pricing date month); no escalation required

---

## 10. Rounding Policy

**Rounding:** Nearest CAD 100
**Rationale:** Professional services estimate at early maturity; inappropriate to report to nearest dollar

---

## 11. Completeness Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| % Lines priced by QUOTE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by RATE_TABLE | 0% |
| % Lines priced by ALLOWANCE | 100% |
| % Deliverables with explicit quantities | 50% (partial - team size TBD) |
| Confidence Level | LOW-MEDIUM |

---

## 12. Known Gaps

1. **Gap G-001:** Number of key team members not finalized (TBD in Datasheet.md Section 2.5)
2. **Gap G-002:** No rate tables available for professional labor rates
3. **Gap G-003:** Resume content gathering effort highly variable
