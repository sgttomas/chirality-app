## 6. Source Classification

### Explicit Pricing Sources
**Status:** NONE FOUND

No vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, or pricing proposals identified in deliverable folder or _Estimates/_RateTables/.

- Key roles list: Available (typical roles enumerated)
- Team size: TBD (not finalized; range 9-13 used)
- Procedure steps: Fully defined (8 main steps)
- Duration per step: Assumed (not explicitly stated)

### Embedded Fallback Model
**Status:** APPLIED

Used allowance-based pricing with industry-typical labor rates due to absence of project-specific rate tables.
