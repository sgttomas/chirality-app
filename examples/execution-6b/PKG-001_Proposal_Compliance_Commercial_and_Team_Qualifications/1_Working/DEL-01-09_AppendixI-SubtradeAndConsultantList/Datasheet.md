## Construction

The Appendix I template is blank in the RFP (p.60). The Proponent fills it in. The following trade scopes and consultant disciplines are anticipated based on the project scope (Fire Hall + Public Works Operations + Cold Storage, 12-acre site, Penhold, Alberta) and Addendum 03 special requirements. Firm names, addresses, and key personnel are Proponent-specific and are marked TBD.

**Template structure confirmed:** Two columns only.
- Column 1: Scope of Work
- Column 2: Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel)

**ASSUMPTION:** The trade scope rows below represent anticipated content based on the project scope from the RFP OSR and addenda. The Proponent determines the actual number of rows, how scopes are bundled, and which firms are assigned.

| # | Scope of Work (Anticipated) | Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Architectural Design | TBD |
| 2 | Structural Engineering | TBD |
| 3 | Mechanical Engineering -- HVAC and Plumbing | TBD |
| 4 | Electrical Engineering and IT | TBD |
| 5 | Civil / Site Engineering | TBD |
| 6 | General Contractor / Construction Management | TBD |
| 7 | Concrete / Foundation Work | TBD |
| 8 | Structural Steel / Pre-Engineered Building Supply | TBD |
| 9 | Overhead Door Supply and Installation (16 ft min height per Addendum 03) | TBD |
| 10 | Roofing (solar-ready per Addendum 03; flat/south/west/southwest orientation) | TBD |
| 11 | Mechanical / HVAC Installation | TBD |
| 12 | Plumbing / Bay Sumps / Water Fill Stations (2" min per Addendum 03) | TBD |
| 13 | Electrical / Power Distribution | TBD |
| 14 | Backup Generator Supply and Installation (per Addendum 03) | TBD |
| 15 | Fire Apparatus Bay Exhaust Ventilation (per Addendum 03) | TBD |
| 16 | Interior Finishes / Flooring | TBD |
| 17 | Millwork / Casework | TBD |
| 18 | Bunker Gear Lockers and Ventilated Storage Room (40 lockers per Addendum 03) | TBD |
| 19 | Built-in Wash Bay and Pressure Washing Equipment (Additional Option 1) | TBD |
| 20 | Yard Lighting (Additional Option 2) | TBD |
| 21 | Access Control System (Additional Option 3) | TBD |
| 22 | Security and Camera System (Additional Option 4) | TBD |
| 23 | Signage (Additional Option 5) | TBD |
| 24 | Appliances / FF&E (Additional Option 6 — $20K cash allowance) | TBD |
| 25 | Landscaping / Site Restoration | TBD |
| 26 | Geotechnical Engineering | TBD |
| 27 | Building Science / Building Envelope Consultant | TBD |
| 28 | Landscape Architecture | TBD |

> **ASSUMPTION (B-002):** Rows 26-28 are candidate disciplines commonly present on Design-Build teams for complex facilities. Geotechnical engineering is typical for new-build projects on undeveloped sites; building science / building envelope consulting is relevant given the high-performance building and energy strategy requirements (Addendum 03 solar-ready, energy performance); landscape architecture may be relevant for the 12-acre site. The Proponent should confirm applicability. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md item B-002; project scope from RFP OSR.
