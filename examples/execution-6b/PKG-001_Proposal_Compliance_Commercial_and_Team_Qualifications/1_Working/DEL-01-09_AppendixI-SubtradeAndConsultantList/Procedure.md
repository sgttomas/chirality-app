## Steps

### Step 1: Identify All Required Scopes of Work

**Owner:** Design Lead + Proposal Manager
**Duration:** 1–2 hours
**Deliverable:** Internal Scope List (spreadsheet or checklist)

**Actions:**

1. Review the OSR (RFP Appendix A) and identify all required design disciplines and trade scopes.
   - Mandatory minimum (ASSUMPTION): Architectural Design; Structural Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; Electrical Engineering and IT; Civil / Site Engineering; General Contractor / Construction Management.
   - Additional: Any specialty disciplines called out in the RFP, OSR, or required by the project program.

2. Review Addendum 03 for specialty scope requirements:
   - Overhead doors — 16 ft minimum height (specialty supplier/installer)
   - Bay sumps — all bays (plumbing or civil specialty)
   - Direct exhaust ventilation for fire apparatus bays — 2 apparatus per bay (specialty mechanical)
   - Backup generator — kitchen, ICP meeting room, 2 bathrooms, plus bay door secondary opening (specialty electrical/mechanical)
   - Water fill stations — minimum one 2" station in fire apparatus bay, one in PW bay (plumbing)
   - Solar-capable roofing — flat/south/west/southwest orientation (roofing + electrical/solar)
   - 40 bunker gear lockers with room-level ventilation (specialty millwork or building products)
   - Addendum 03 scopes for Additional Options 1–6 (wash bay, yard lighting, access control, security/cameras, signage, appliances/FF&E)

3. Create an internal Scope List:
   - Column A: Scope of Work (what will appear in Appendix I Column 1)
   - Column B: Required? (Y/N)
   - Column C: Assigned Firm (TBD — to fill in Step 2)
   - Column D: Key Personnel (TBD — to fill in Step 3)
   - Column E: Notes / Open Items

4. Note any scopes that are TBD (firm not yet contracted or assigned) and flag for escalation.

**Verification:**
- [ ] All OSR disciplines included in scope list
- [ ] All Addendum 03 specialty requirements assessed and included where unique firm assignment applies
- [ ] Scope list reviewed and approved by Design Lead and Proposal Manager

---

### Step 2: Map Each Scope to a Responsible Firm

**Owner:** Proposal Manager
**Duration:** 2–4 hours
**Deliverable:** Scope-to-Firm Mapping (internal spreadsheet)

**Actions:**

1. For each scope in the Step 1 list, determine the responsible firm:
   - **In-house:** If the Design-Builder has in-house capability, assign to the Design-Builder's legal entity.
   - **External Consultant/Specialist:** If outsourced, assign to the external firm.
   - **Trade Contractor:** For construction trades, assign to the trade contractor or general contractor.

2. For each assignment, record:
   - **Company Name** — legal name as the firm is registered in Alberta (not a d/b/a unless necessary)
   - **Address** — registered office or principal place of business (for contract notices)
   - Note: these two items will feed directly into Appendix I Column 2

3. Flag any scopes not yet assigned:
   - Mark as "TBD — to be assigned upon contract finalization"
   - Document the rationale
   - Do not leave gaps blank in the final Appendix I without justification

4. Handle shared-scope assignments:
   - If two or more firms share responsibility for a single scope (e.g., joint ventures or split mechanical/electrical), document the shared arrangement explicitly in the Appendix I table.
   - **Format for shared scopes:** Use a single Scope of Work row with both firms listed in Column 2, separated by a clear delimiter. Example: "Firm A (lead -- HVAC), Firm B (support -- controls)." Alternatively, use two rows with the same scope name and a parenthetical note indicating the shared arrangement (e.g., "Mechanical Engineering -- HVAC and Plumbing (shared -- see note)").
   - Record the basis for the shared arrangement (e.g., joint venture agreement, split scope memorandum) in the internal Scope-to-Firm Mapping spreadsheet.
   - **ASSUMPTION:** Shared-scope rows are uncommon; most scopes should have a single responsible firm. Source: Specification R-03 (each row requires Company Name, Address, Key Personnel); _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md item F-002.

5. Check for scope gaps: any scopes from Step 1 without a firm assignment must be escalated.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Every scope has a firm assignment (or documented "TBD" with justification)
- [ ] All firm names are legal, Alberta-registered names
- [ ] All addresses are current and valid
- [ ] No scope is assigned to two firms without explicit note of shared responsibility

---

### Step 3: Designate Key Personnel for Each Scope

**Owner:** Proposal Manager / HR
**Duration:** 2–3 hours
**Deliverable:** Key Personnel list (feeds into Appendix I Column 2 and DEL-01-08)

**Actions:**

1. For each scope assigned in Step 2, identify a named key personnel member responsible for that scope.
   - This person is the primary point of contact and the individual whose name will appear in Appendix I Column 2.
   - For design disciplines: typically the principal or senior registered professional (e.g., Principal Architect, P.Eng.).
   - For trade contractors: typically the owner or project manager.

2. For each key person, record:
   - Full name (as it will appear in the proposal and on contract documents)
   - Professional title and credentials (e.g., P.Eng., B.Arch., Project Manager)
   - Current role at the firm

3. Consistency check — run before finalizing:
   - Every key person named in Appendix I must have a resume in DEL-01-08.
   - If a key person is named in Appendix I but lacks a resume, either add them to DEL-01-08 immediately or replace them with someone who has a resume.
   - Record any changes in a revision log.

4. Availability confirmation:
   - Confirm named individuals are current employees/partners of their firm.
   - Confirm they are available to work on this project during proposal and construction phases.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Every scope has a named key person
- [ ] Every named person will have a resume in DEL-01-08
- [ ] Names are spelled correctly and match resume/legal documentation
- [ ] Credentials are accurate and current (Alberta registration where applicable)
- [ ] Availability confirmed

### Step 4: Populate the RFP Appendix I Table

**Owner:** Proposal Manager
**Duration:** 1–2 hours
**Deliverable:** Completed Appendix I table (Word/PDF)

**Actions:**

1. Open or reproduce the RFP Appendix I template (§12.14, p.60). The confirmed format is:

   | Scope of Work | Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel) |
   |---|---|
   | [Row 1] | [Company Name], [Address]; [Key Person Name, Title] |
   | ... | ... |

2. Populate each row:
   - **Column 1 (Scope of Work):** Use the scope names established in Step 1. Be consistent with terminology used in DEL-01-07 and DEL-07-03.
   - **Column 2 (Subtrade):** Combine Company Name, Address, and Key Personnel in this single column. A clear format is: "Company Name, Address; Key Person Name, Title, Credentials."

3. Formatting guidance:
   - Use consistent font, spacing, and capitalization across all rows.
   - Ensure the table is readable at normal zoom — avoid excessively small text.
   - If the standard template rows are insufficient, add continuation rows/pages per RFP instruction.

4. Completeness check:
   - Every scope from Step 1 is represented.
   - No mandatory fields blank.
   - Continuation pages (if any) are clearly marked "Appendix I (continued)."

5. Addendum 03 coverage check:
   - Confirm that Addendum 03 specialty scopes requiring unique firm assignment are included in the table.

**Verification:**
- [ ] All template fields populated
- [ ] No blank mandatory fields
- [ ] All scopes from Step 1 represented
- [ ] Formatting consistent and professional
- [ ] Addendum 03 specialty scopes addressed
- [ ] Continuation pages clearly marked (if used)

---

### Step 5: Cross-Check Consistency with DEL-01-07 and DEL-01-08

**Owner:** Proposal Manager + QA Lead
**Duration:** 1–2 hours
**Deliverable:** Cross-Reference Verification Matrix (internal use)

**Actions:**

1. **DEL-01-07 Alignment (Firm Experience):**
   - For each firm in Appendix I, confirm it appears in DEL-01-07 for the corresponding scope.
   - Check that scope language matches between Appendix I and DEL-01-07.
   - Resolve gaps: add missing firms to DEL-01-07 or adjust Appendix I.

2. **DEL-01-08 Alignment (Key Personnel Resumes):**
   - For each key person in Appendix I, confirm a resume exists in DEL-01-08.
   - Check that name, title, and credentials match between Appendix I and the resume.
   - Resolve gaps: add missing resumes to DEL-01-08 or adjust Appendix I.

3. Create a Verification Matrix:
   - Column A: Scope of Work (from Appendix I)
   - Column B: Firm Name
   - Column C: In DEL-01-07? (Y/N/Section reference)
   - Column D: Key Person
   - Column E: Resume in DEL-01-08? (Y/N/Page reference)
   - Column F: Notes / Discrepancies

4. QA review:
   - Have a reviewer (other than the Proposal Manager) review the matrix and the three deliverables side by side.
   - Obtain sign-off on the matrix.

5. **Pre-submission scoring self-assessment:**
   - Using the RFP ss8.3 scoring rubric (Unacceptable through Exceptional, applied to 15 points), the Proposal Manager should rate the completed Appendix I against each scoring tier.
   - Reference the scoring tier interpretation in Guidance P-05 to identify which tier the current Appendix I most closely matches.
   - Identify specific improvement opportunities that could move the submission to the next tier (e.g., adding missing specialty scope assignments, strengthening credentials presentation, filling remaining TBD items).
   - Document the self-assessment rating and any improvement actions taken in the Cross-Reference Verification Matrix or a separate scoring self-assessment note.
   - **ASSUMPTION:** This self-assessment is an internal quality improvement exercise; the scoring rubric interpretation is based on inference from RFP ss8.3 and is not an official scoring guide. Source: Guidance P-05; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md item D-002.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Every firm in Appendix I has a corresponding entry in DEL-01-07
- [ ] Every key person in Appendix I has a resume in DEL-01-08
- [ ] Names, titles, and credentials consistent across all three documents
- [ ] QA review completed and signed off
- [ ] Pre-submission scoring self-assessment completed; improvement actions documented

---

### Step 6: Integrate Appendix I into the Final Proposal PDF

**Owner:** Proposal Manager / Publications
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Deliverable:** Appendix I embedded in final proposal PDF

**Actions:**

1. Convert the completed Appendix I table to PDF if not already in PDF format.

2. Verify the PDF is:
   - Readable (text not blurry or distorted)
   - Searchable (text can be selected)
   - Complete (all rows and continuation pages present)

3. Insert Appendix I into the main proposal document:
   - Position: After Appendix H (Financial Proposal) per RFP structure.
   - Ensure it is referenced in the proposal Table of Contents.

4. File size check:
   - Verify the complete proposal PDF (including all appendices) is under 15 MB (C-01, RFP §4.2).
   - If over 15 MB, compress images or reduce resolution in non-critical graphics; do not omit or compress Appendix I text.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Appendix I is readable and complete in the final PDF
- [ ] Positioned after Appendix H; referenced in Table of Contents
- [ ] Final proposal PDF is under 15 MB
- [ ] All data in PDF matches the verified internal draft

---

### Step 7: Final Sign-Off

**Owner:** Proposal Manager / Executive
**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Deliverable:** Sign-off memo (internal record)

**Actions:**

1. Prepare a brief Appendix I sign-off memo summarizing:
   - Number of scope rows included
   - Any TBD items and their justification (if any remain)
   - Confirmation of cross-reference check (DEL-01-07 and DEL-01-08 aligned)
   - Confirmation of QA review completion

2. Obtain sign-off from:
   - **Proposal Manager** (completeness, accuracy)
   - **Design Lead or Principal-in-Charge** (technical discipline assignments are sound)
   - **Executive or Proposal Sponsor** (final approval to submit)

3. File sign-off memo in the proposal project archive.

**Verification:**
- [ ] Sign-off memo completed
- [ ] All required approvals obtained
- [ ] No outstanding unresolved TBD items
- [ ] Proposal ready for final email submission by August 30, 2024 at 2:00 PM MST

## Notes

- **CONFIRMED**: The RFP Appendix I template (p.60) uses two columns: "Scope of Work" and "Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel)". All personnel, address, and firm information are contained in Column 2. There is no separate Contact column.
- **CONFIRMED**: Additional lines/pages are explicitly permitted (RFP Appendix I, p.60).
- **CONFIRMED**: Submission deadline is August 30, 2024 at 2:00 PM MST by email to spendergast@townofpenhold.ca (RFP §5.3, p.14).
- **ASSUMPTION**: Appendix I coverage at the prime/principal firm level is sufficient. Sub-tier subcontractors are not required unless the Proponent elects to include them.
- **TBD**: Exact firm names, addresses, and key personnel — Proponent-specific. Not determinable from RFP sources alone.
