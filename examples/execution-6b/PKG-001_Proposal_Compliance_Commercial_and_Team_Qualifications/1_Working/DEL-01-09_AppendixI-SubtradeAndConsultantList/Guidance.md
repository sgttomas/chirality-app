# Guidance: Appendix I -- Subtrade and Consultant List

## Purpose

Appendix I serves three critical functions in the Design-Build proposal:

1. **Compliance**: Fulfills RFP Constraint C-06 (mandatory Appendix I submission per RFP §4.3, p.12-13). Missing or incomplete Appendix I may result in proposal rejection as incomplete (RFP §5.1, p.13; §2.5, p.9).

2. **Team Credibility**: Demonstrates to the Town of Penhold that the Design-Builder has assembled a qualified, experienced team capable of delivering all required disciplines and trades. Appendix I is evaluated under the criterion **"Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" for 15 points** of a total 100-point evaluation (RFP §8.2, p.26). This is a significant technical criterion — equal to Building Durability and second only to the Conceptual Design score among technical criteria.

3. **Contractual Clarity**: Establishes the Design-Builder's organizational structure, identifies each firm's scope of responsibility, and provides contact information for all key participants, reducing ambiguity during contract execution and construction administration.

## Principles

### P-01: Completeness Over Depth
Appendix I is a **roster and contact reference**, not a narrative. Every major scope must be represented, even if detailed qualifications appear in DEL-01-07. A missing discipline or vague assignment is worse than a simple, clear assignment.

**Application:**
- List every discipline and major trade scope required by the project.
- If a firm performs multiple scopes, use separate rows — one row per scope assignment.
- Use clear, standardized scope names following the canonical naming convention below (see Vocabulary Authority section).
- Include Addendum 03 specialty scopes where unique firm assignment is needed (overhead doors, bay sumps, exhaust ventilation, backup generator, solar-ready roof, bunker gear lockers, water fill stations).

### P-02: Legal and Contractual Accuracy
The firm names and personnel listed in Appendix I become **contractual identities**. They must be:
- Legally registered and authorized to contract in Alberta
- Accurately named as they will appear on project agreements
- Current (not a dissolved firm or a departed principal)

**Application:**
- Use **legal company names** exactly as they appear on Alberta corporate registrations.
- Designate a **principal** (owner, partner, or senior manager with authority) for each major scope.
- Verify that all named individuals are current employees or partners of the listed firm.

### P-03: Cross-Document Consistency
Appendix I is the **authoritative roster** of the Design-Build team. Every person and firm listed here must be consistent with DEL-01-07 and DEL-01-08.

**Application:**
- Before finalizing Appendix I, cross-check every firm and key person against DEL-01-07 (firm experience) and DEL-01-08 (key personnel resumes).
- If someone is in Appendix I but lacks a resume in DEL-01-08, add them to DEL-01-08 before submission.
- If a firm is in Appendix I but has no experience narrative in DEL-01-07, add them to DEL-01-07 before submission.
- Use identical names, titles, and scope descriptions across all three documents.

### P-04: Clarity of Scope Boundaries
The scope-of-work column must unambiguously assign responsibility. Overlapping or vague scopes create confusion during evaluation and contract administration.

**Application:**
- Use discipline or trade names that align with the OSR (e.g., "Mechanical Engineering and Design" not just "Mechanical").
- For specialty roles (e.g., Building Science, Accessibility, IT/Security), include the specialty name.
- For General Contractor or Construction Manager, specify whether they are the Design-Builder's in-house team or a separate prime contractor.
- For trades with Addendum 03 requirements, consider whether to assign these as separate specialist rows or integrate them into broader trade rows.

### P-05: Align with the 15-Point Scoring Weight
With 15 points available for "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" (RFP §8.2, p.26), this deliverable deserves care commensurate with its scoring weight. The Evaluation Committee uses the §8.3 scoring rubric — from Unacceptable (0–40%) to Exceptional (100%) — applied to 15 points maximum.

**Application:**
- A complete, well-organized Appendix I with clearly qualified firms and named personnel signals competence and organization (tending toward "Very Good" to "Excellent").
- Gaps, vague assignments, or inconsistencies with DEL-01-07 and DEL-01-08 will reduce the score.
- Treat Appendix I as a signal of team quality, not just a form to complete.

**Scoring Tier Interpretation (ASSUMPTION -- inferred from RFP ss8.3 rubric structure):**

The following interpretation provides directional guidance on what distinguishes scoring tiers for Appendix I under the 15-point "Project Team and Firms" criterion. This is an ASSUMPTION based on the general rubric structure in RFP ss8.3 (p.26-27); the RFP does not provide Appendix I-specific tier definitions.

| Tier | Score Range | Likely Appendix I Attributes |
|------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Exceptional** (100%) | 15.0 pts | All scopes covered with named, qualified firms and named key personnel; all Addendum 03 specialty requirements explicitly assigned; complete cross-reference alignment with DEL-01-07 and DEL-01-08; professional credentials clearly displayed; no gaps, no TBDs |
| **Very Good** (80%) | 12.0 pts | All major scopes covered; most specialty scopes assigned; key personnel named for all major disciplines; minor gaps in supporting trades or credentials presentation |
| **Acceptable** (60%) | 9.0 pts | Core design and construction disciplines covered; some specialty scopes missing or bundled without clear identification; some key personnel listed as role titles rather than named individuals |
| **Below Expectations** (40-60%) | 6.0-9.0 pts | Significant scope gaps; multiple missing firm assignments; inconsistencies with DEL-01-07 / DEL-01-08 |
| **Unacceptable** (0-40%) | 0-6.0 pts | Incomplete or missing Appendix I; major disciplines unassigned; no key personnel identified |

**Evaluator Merit Assessment Drivers (ASSUMPTION -- inferred from RFP evaluation framework):**

Based on the RFP evaluation structure and the nature of the "Project Team and Firms" criterion, evaluators are likely to assess substantiated merit in Appendix I based on the following attributes (in estimated order of impact):

1. **Completeness of scope coverage** -- Are all required disciplines and specialty trades accounted for? (Primary driver)
2. **Depth of key personnel credentials** -- Are named individuals clearly qualified (P.Eng., B.Arch., relevant certifications)? Does the team demonstrate relevant experience?
3. **Breadth of specialty coverage** -- Are Addendum 03 specialty requirements explicitly assigned to qualified firms rather than generically bundled?
4. **Cross-document coherence** -- Does the team roster align seamlessly with firm experience (DEL-01-07) and resumes (DEL-01-08)?
5. **Geographic proximity and Alberta presence** -- Are firms local or do they demonstrate Alberta registration and capacity to serve the Penhold project?

## Considerations

### C-01: Geographic and Professional Credentials Context
The Town of Penhold is in Alberta. Key considerations:
- All professional consultants (engineers, architects) must hold **Alberta registration** (Professional Engineers Alberta; Architects Association of Alberta).
- If a firm is headquartered outside Alberta, confirm it has authority to practice in Alberta (e.g., a P.Eng. or B.Arch. registered in Alberta) and note this.
- If any firm is out-of-province, the on-site presence and communication approach should be addressed in DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach).

### C-02: Strategic Coherence
Appendix I should reflect the **technical strategy** documented in DEL-01-07:
- If DEL-01-07 emphasizes the Design-Builder's in-house design capability, key design disciplines should appear as in-house in Appendix I.
- If DEL-01-07 emphasizes a network of specialist subconsultants, Appendix I should show that network clearly and completely.
- The Evaluation Committee assesses the coherence of the team strategy; Appendix I is where it becomes visible.

### C-03: Addendum 03 Specialty Requirements
Addendum 03 introduced several specialty requirements that may warrant dedicated trade assignments in Appendix I:
- 16 ft minimum overhead doors (specialty supplier/installer)
- Bay sumps (specialty plumbing or civil)
- Direct fire apparatus bay exhaust ventilation (specialty mechanical)
- Backup generator (specialty electrical/mechanical)
- Water fill stations — 2" minimum (specialty plumbing)
- Solar-capable roofing (solar-ready design; specialty roofing or electrical)
- 40 bunker gear lockers with ventilated storage room (specialty millwork or building products supplier)

Not every item necessarily requires a separate Appendix I row; the Proponent may bundle related scopes. However, if a specialty firm is being used for any of these items, they should appear in the table.

### C-04: Sub-Tier Contractors
The RFP Appendix I template and SOW-0007 do not explicitly require sub-tier contractors (e.g., mechanical sub-subcontractors). **ASSUMPTION:** Appendix I coverage at the prime/principal subcontractor level is sufficient. Sub-tier firms, if relevant, may be addressed in DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach Narrative).

### C-05: Multi-Scope Firm Concentration
When a single firm covers multiple scopes in Appendix I (e.g., the Design-Builder appearing in many rows, or one consulting firm handling both Mechanical and Electrical), P-01 directs using separate rows per scope assignment. However, the Proponent should consider the evaluative implication of a single firm appearing across many rows:

- **Positive signal:** A firm covering multiple related scopes may demonstrate integrated capability, reduced coordination risk, and cost efficiency.
- **Potential concern:** Excessive concentration on one firm across unrelated scopes may signal over-reliance, limited team depth, or lack of specialist capacity.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Evaluators are likely to view multi-scope assignments positively when the scopes are closely related (e.g., Mechanical HVAC + Plumbing by one mechanical engineering firm) and less favorably when unrelated scopes are concentrated (e.g., one firm handling both Electrical and Landscaping). The Proponent should ensure the team composition signals both depth and breadth.

## Trade-Offs

### T-01: Completeness vs. Simplicity
**Trade-off:** Including every conceivable specialty discipline makes Appendix I longer and more complex. Omitting a scope the Owner expects may signal incompleteness.

**Resolution:**
- Identify **mandatory** disciplines from the OSR and RFP (Architectural, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT, General Contractor).
- Add **specialty disciplines** only if explicitly required or obviously needed for this project (e.g., building science for a high-performance facility; a specialty supplier for Addendum 03 requirements).
- When in doubt, include it. An extra line in Appendix I is less risky than a missing scope.

### T-02: In-House vs. Subconsultant Presentation
**Trade-off:** Showing a scope as in-house projects full control and capability. Showing it as a subconsultant may signal specialization but implies reliance on another firm.

**Resolution:**
- Align with the Design-Build delivery model described in DEL-01-07.
- Be consistent: do not claim in-house design capability in DEL-01-07 but list design disciplines as external consultants in Appendix I (or vice versa).

### T-03: Named Personnel vs. Role Designation
**Trade-off:** Naming a specific principal creates accountability but may create issues if that person becomes unavailable. A generic designation is safer but less committal and less impressive to evaluators.

**Resolution:**
- For **senior/lead roles** (Design-Builder's principal, Lead Architect, Construction Manager), name a specific, committed individual.
- For **technical support roles**, a role title may be acceptable.
- Propose a key person change notification protocol in DEL-07-03 so substitutions are managed transparently.

## Vocabulary Authority

This section establishes canonical naming conventions to ensure consistency across all four documents and the actual Appendix I submission.

### Canonical Scope Names

Use the following em-dash format for scope naming across all documents (Datasheet Construction table, Specification requirements, Procedure steps, and the final Appendix I table):

| Canonical Scope Name | Variants to Avoid |
|---|---|
| Architectural Design | Architecture, Arch Design |
| Structural Engineering | Structural, Struct Eng |
| Mechanical Engineering -- HVAC and Plumbing | Mechanical Engineering (HVAC, Plumbing), Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical |
| Electrical Engineering and IT | Electrical, Electrical/IT, Elec Eng |
| Civil / Site Engineering | Civil Engineering, Site Engineering, Civil |
| General Contractor / Construction Management | GC, Construction Manager |

> **Convention:** Use "Discipline -- Specialty" format with em-dash when a discipline has sub-specialties (e.g., "Mechanical Engineering -- HVAC and Plumbing"). Use "/" for genuinely co-equal scopes (e.g., "Civil / Site Engineering"). Source: Guidance P-01; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md item B-003.

### Canonical Cross-Reference Names

Use the following labels when referring to cross-referenced deliverables:

| Deliverable ID | Canonical Name | Variants to Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| DEL-01-07 | Design-Build Firm Experience Profile | Firm Experience, Firm Experience Profile |
| DEL-01-08 | Key Team Members and Resumes | Key Team Members, Key Personnel Resumes |
| DEL-07-03 | Subconsultant Approach Narrative | Subconsultant Approach, Sub Approach |

## Notes

- **CONFIRMED**: The Appendix I template (RFP §12.14, p.60) uses two columns only: "Scope of Work" and "Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel)". There is no separate Contact column in the RFP template. Contact details are embedded within the Key Personnel field if needed.
- **CONFIRMED**: The RFP explicitly permits additional lines/pages (RFP Appendix I, p.60).
- **CONFIRMED**: Evaluation criterion "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" = 15 points (RFP §8.2, p.26).
- **ASSUMPTION**: Sub-tier contractors are not required in Appendix I — prime/principal firm coverage is sufficient.
- **TBD**: Exact firm names, addresses, and key personnel — Proponent-specific; not determinable from RFP sources alone.
