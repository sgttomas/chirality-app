## Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Source | Priority |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **R-01** | Provide Appendix I using the mandatory two-column table format defined by RFP Appendix I (p.60): Column 1 = "Scope of Work"; Column 2 = "Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel)". | RFP Appendix I (p.60); C-06 | Mandatory |
| **R-02** | Map all major trade scopes and consultant disciplines to responsible firms in the Appendix I table. **Confirmed mandatory minimum scopes:** Architectural, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT, Civil, and General Contractor/Construction Management (these are established by the project scope and OSR requirements). **Proponent-discretionary expansion:** Additional specialty scopes beyond this minimum are determined by the Proponent based on their delivery model and project requirements (see Addendum 03 specialty requirements in R-11). ASSUMPTION: the six named disciplines represent the mandatory minimum; this should be confirmed by the Proposal Manager against the final OSR review. | RFP §4.3 (p.12-13); Decomposition SOW-0007; OSR (RFP Appendix A) | Mandatory |
| **R-03** | For each row in the Appendix I table, provide all three required subtrade fields in Column 2: (a) Company Name, (b) Address, and (c) Key Personnel. | RFP Appendix I template (p.60) | Mandatory |
| **R-04** | Include additional lines/pages as needed to cover all scopes — the template explicitly permits expansion. | RFP Appendix I (p.60): "Additional lines/pages to be added if required" | Mandatory if scopes exceed provided rows |
| **R-05** | Company names listed must be legal names as the firms are authorized to contract in Alberta. | CCDC 14-2013 / standard contract practice; RFP §5.2 (p.13) | Mandatory |
| **R-06** | Address for each subtrade/consultant must be current and valid for contract notice purposes. | Standard contract practice | Mandatory |
| **R-07** | Key personnel listed for each scope must be named individuals — not generic role placeholders. ASSUMPTION: "key personnel" means at minimum the responsible principal or project lead for that scope. | RFP Appendix I template (p.60); RFP §7.1.6 (p.18) | Mandatory |
| **R-08** | Ensure consistency between key personnel names in Appendix I and resumes in DEL-01-08 (Key Team Members and Resumes). Persons listed in Appendix I must have resumes in DEL-01-08. | _REFERENCES.md; cross-document consistency requirement | Mandatory |
| **R-09** | Ensure consistency between firm names in Appendix I and the firm experience described in DEL-01-07 (Design-Build Firm Experience Profile). Firms in Appendix I for design disciplines should have corresponding experience in DEL-01-07. | _REFERENCES.md; cross-document consistency requirement | Mandatory |
| **R-12** | Ensure consistency between scope assignments in Appendix I and the subconsultant approach described in DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach Narrative). Scope assignments and firm roles in Appendix I should align with the management and coordination approach documented in DEL-07-03. | _REFERENCES.md; Guidance C-02, C-04 | Mandatory |
| **R-10** | Submit Appendix I as part of the single proposal PDF. The complete proposal PDF must be under 15 MB. | RFP §4.2 (p.12); C-01 | Mandatory |
| **R-11** | Include Addendum 03 special-requirement scopes in the table coverage. The following Addendum 03 scopes must each be explicitly represented as a distinct row or clearly identified within an existing scope row: (a) overhead doors -- 16 ft minimum height; (b) bay sumps; (c) direct fire apparatus bay exhaust ventilation; (d) backup generator; (e) water fill stations -- 2" minimum; (f) solar-ready roofing; (g) bunker gear lockers -- 40 units with ventilated storage room. For each of these scopes, the Proponent must either assign a unique specialist firm (separate row) or explicitly identify the scope within a broader trade row. ASSUMPTION: scopes that are bundled into broader rows should include a parenthetical reference to the Addendum 03 requirement to demonstrate coverage to evaluators. | Addendum 03 §1.x (multiple subsections) | Mandatory |

## Verification

| Verification Check | Success Criteria | Responsible |
|---|---|---|
| **Template Compliance** | Appendix I uses the two-column format from RFP Appendix I (p.60); no fields restructured | Proposal Manager |
| **Scope Completeness** | All major trades and consultant disciplines relevant to the project scope are listed with assigned firms | Design Lead + Proposal Manager |
| **Addendum 03 Coverage** | Table includes rows covering Addendum 03 special-requirement scopes (doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, solar, lockers, fill stations) where those scopes require unique firm assignment | Design Lead |
| **Column 2 Completeness** | Each row has Company Name, Address, and Key Personnel populated — no partially blank rows | Proposal Manager |
| **DEL-01-08 Alignment** | Every key person named in Appendix I has a resume in DEL-01-08; names and titles consistent | Proposal Manager / QA |
| **DEL-01-07 Alignment** | Every firm named in Appendix I for design disciplines has corresponding experience in DEL-01-07 | Proposal Manager / QA |
| **PDF Integration** | Appendix I is embedded in the final proposal PDF; readable, complete, under 15 MB total | Publications |
| **Legal Name Accuracy** | Company names match Alberta corporate registry or equivalent authorization to contract. **Verification method:** Confirm each firm name against the Alberta Corporate Registry (Service Alberta) online search or equivalent provincial/federal registry for out-of-province firms. Record confirmation date and registry reference for each firm. | Finance / Legal |
| **Professional Registration Verification** | All professional consultants (engineers, architects) listed in Appendix I hold current Alberta registration: P.Eng. via APEGA (Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta); B.Arch. / licensed architect via AAA (Alberta Association of Architects). **Verification method:** Confirm registration status via APEGA and AAA online member directories. | Finance / Legal; Proposal Manager |
| **Named Individuals Verification (R-07)** | Key personnel entries in Column 2 are named individuals (full name with title/credentials) -- not generic role placeholders (e.g., "Project Manager" or "TBD"). Each entry must identify a specific person. | Proposal Manager / QA |
| **DEL-07-03 Alignment** | Scope assignments and firm roles in Appendix I are consistent with the subconsultant management and coordination approach described in DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach Narrative). No contradictions between Appendix I team structure and DEL-07-03 narrative. | Proposal Manager / QA |
| **Overall Acceptance Criterion (Pass/Fail)** | Appendix I is considered **complete and compliant** for submission when ALL of the following are met: (1) all mandatory requirements R-01 through R-12 are satisfied; (2) no blank mandatory fields remain in Column 2; (3) all verification checks above pass; (4) cross-references to DEL-01-07, DEL-01-08, and DEL-07-03 are verified; (5) Proposal Manager and Design Lead sign-off obtained. Failure of any mandatory requirement constitutes a **fail** requiring remediation before submission. | Proposal Manager + Design Lead |

## Documentation

**Deliverable artifacts required:**
- Completed Appendix I table (PDF, embedded in main proposal document)

**Supporting records (internal use, not submitted):**
- Scope-to-firm mapping spreadsheet (internal working document)
- Cross-reference verification matrix (Appendix I ↔ DEL-01-07 ↔ DEL-01-08)
- Legal name confirmation (corporate registration documentation per firm)

## Notes

- **CONFIRMED**: The Appendix I template (RFP p.60) uses a two-column structure: "Scope of Work" and "Subtrade (Company Name, Address, Key Personnel)". There is no separate "Contact" column in the template. Contact details may be included within the Key Personnel field if desired.
- **CONFIRMED**: The RFP explicitly permits additional lines/pages (RFP Appendix I, p.60).
- **CONFIRMED**: Appendix I is evaluated under "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" for 15 points (RFP §8.2, p.26).
- **ASSUMPTION**: "Covers all major trade scopes and consultant disciplines" (Decomposition DEL-01-09) means at minimum the primary design disciplines and construction trades needed to deliver the integrated Fire Hall + Public Works + Cold Storage facility.
- **TBD**: Exact list of trade scopes and assigned firms — determined by the Proponent based on their delivery model and team.
- **TBD**: Whether the Proponent treats Addendum 03 special-requirement items (sumps, exhaust, generator, lockers) as separate rows or bundles them into broader mechanical/electrical/architectural rows.
