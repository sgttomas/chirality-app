**Labour & Materials Payment Bond (50% of Contract Price)**
- **Purpose:** Protects lien claimants (subtrades, suppliers) for labour and materials supplied to the project

## Summary

DEL-01-03 defines the bonding and insurance evidence required for a compliant proposal submission to the Town of Penhold for the Public Services Building Design-Build project (RFP 2024_004). The deliverable consists of two primary artifacts:

1. **Executed Agreement to Bond** — Proof of surety-backed performance and payment bonds (50%/50% split of Contract Price) as mandated by RFP Section 5.3.1 (Constraint C-08). Bond document must be duly executed by an Alberta-authorized surety and included with the proposal submission.

2. **CCIP Insurance Approach Statement** — Confirmation that the Design-Builder (if awarded) will arrange and carry all project insurance under a Contractor Controlled Insurance Program per Appendix J (SC 50–52) governance. Insurance costs are fixed and embedded in proposal pricing. Decision DEC-011 confirmed this approach (OI-003 closed).

Both artifacts are mandatory compliance items. The executed bond document and CCIP insurance approach statement must be internally consistent across Schedule A (DEL-01-04), Schedule B (DEL-01-05), and the Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06), and must be verified through the Compliance Matrix (DEL-01-01).
