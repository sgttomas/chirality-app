# Bonding and Insurance Evidence — Guidance

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-01-03
**Package:** PKG-001 — Proposal Compliance, Commercial & Team Qualifications
**Status:** SEMANTIC_READY (Pass 3 enrichment applied)
**Date:** 2026-02-17

---

## Purpose

DEL-01-03 addresses a critical compliance and financial risk allocation question: **How does the Design-Builder (proponent) demonstrate financial security and insurance responsibility to the Town of Penhold?**

This deliverable serves two audiences:

1. **RFP Evaluation Committee (Town compliance review):**
   - Verifies that bonding evidence is complete, valid, and correctly structured (50%+50% split; Alberta-authorized surety)
   - Confirms that insurance approach is clearly stated and compliant with RFP/Appendix J requirements (CCIP confirmed)
   - Assesses transparency of financial risk allocation

2. **Finance/Contracting (post-award execution):**
   - Confirms that bond and insurance costs are embedded in contract pricing with no hidden costs or post-award adjustments
   - Ensures the insurance program will be in place pre-mobilization
   - Provides audit trail for cost certainty and risk allocation claims throughout the project lifecycle

**Strategic rationale:** RFP Section 5.3.1 mandates bonding evidence as a pass/fail compliance gate (C-08). Open Issue OI-003 (resolved via DEC-011) confirmed that the Town expects CCIP, not OCIP. This deliverable makes the proponent's risk allocation commitment explicit and the financial security framework transparent.

## Principles

### P-001: Bonding as Financial Security, Not Cost to Minimize

**Principle:**
Bonding (performance + payment bonds) is the RFP's mechanism for ensuring the Design-Builder has financial incentive and surety backing to complete the work and pay subtrades. The 50%/50% split balances performance risk (Construction risk) with payment/lien risk (subcontractor risk). This is a non-negotiable structure per Constraint C-08.

**Application:**
- Do not view bonding as "overhead to minimize." View it as a financial security commitment that the Town expects, and price it accordingly.
- Obtain surety quotes **early** in the proposal development timeline (during estimate phase) so that bonding premiums can be embedded in Schedule B general requirements before pricing is locked.
- Confirm that the selected surety is Alberta-authorized before investing time in bond documentation; out-of-province sureties may not be acceptable.
- Calculate bond amounts accurately from the **final** Schedule A line 1-1 base price; do not use a rounded or estimated number.

**Consequence of misalignment:** If the Agreement to Bond is incomplete, unsigned, or omits required components, the proposal fails compliance gate C-08 and is disqualified.

---

### P-002: CCIP as a Fixed Cost and Risk Allocation Commitment

**Principle:**
CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) means the Design-Builder bears all insurance procurement cost and responsibility. This was confirmed per DEC-011. By accepting CCIP, the proponent absorbs insurance cost variability (if markets harden post-award) and takes responsibility for all coverage adequacy. In exchange, the proponent controls the insurance program and maintains relationships with insurers.

**Application:**
- Treat CCIP insurance costs as a **fixed, non-negotiable line item** in Schedule B; do not present insurance as an allowance or "TBD."
- Obtain insurance broker quotes that reflect current market conditions; do not rely on generic percentage estimates.
- Declare explicitly in DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative) that CCIP costs are fixed and not subject to post-award adjustment, even if insurance markets change.
- Ensure that all anticipated coverage types (GL, Builder's Risk, Auto, WC, Additional Insured endorsements for Town) are included in the broker quote.

**Consequence of misalignment:** If CCIP costs are vague or presented as variable, the Town may question price reasonableness and cost certainty, and may raise compliance questions about the proponent's ability to deliver on the insurance commitment.

---

### P-003: Cross-Document Consistency as Audit Trail

**Principle:**
The bonding and insurance evidence must be internally consistent across four linked documents: Compliance Matrix (DEL-01-01), Schedule A (DEL-01-04), Schedule B (DEL-01-05), and Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06). Inconsistencies — even minor ones — create audit risk, raise compliance questions, and signal poor proposal management.

**Application:**
- Schedule A line 1-1 (base contract price) must equal the **sum of all Schedule B line items**, including bonding and CCIP insurance.
- Schedule B must have **explicit, labeled line items** for "Performance & Payment Bond Premiums" and "CCIP Project Insurance Costs" — not buried in lump sums or unlabeled contingencies.
- DEL-01-06 must explicitly state dollar amounts for bond costs and insurance costs, confirm inclusion in Schedule A line 1-1, and declare no post-award adjustment.
- DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix) must mark bonding and CCIP insurance as "INCLUDED" / "PASS" with evidence references.

**Consequence of misalignment:** Price auditors and evaluation committee members will detect gaps (e.g., Schedule B total ≠ Schedule A line 1-1; bonding mentioned in narrative but absent from Schedule B), triggering requests for clarification or, at worst, compliance rejection.

## Considerations

### C-001: Timing — Surety and Insurance Procurement vs. Pricing Deadline

**Context:**
Surety bond execution and insurance policy issuance are post-award actions, but pricing impact must be reflected in the proposal (pre-deadline). This creates a timing mismatch: costs must be estimated and committed to before final quotes are always available.

**Guidance:**
- During proposal estimate phase: work with insurance broker and surety to obtain **preliminary quotes** (not hard commitments, but current market estimates).
- Use preliminary quotes to populate Schedule B line items.
- In DEL-01-06, use language such as: "Bond and insurance costs are estimated based on preliminary broker/surety quotes current as of [date]. Executed bonds and certificates of insurance will be provided post-award prior to site mobilization."
- Do **not** leave bonding/insurance costs blank or marked "TBD" in Schedule B; this creates compliance risk and signals unprepared pricing.
- If final quotes differ from estimates, the Design-Builder absorbs the difference (fixed price commitment). Document this intent in DEL-01-06.

---

### C-002: Surety Authorization and Bonding Capacity

**Context:**
The surety must be authorized to issue bonds in Alberta. Not all national sureties have Alberta authorization. Additionally, the bonding capacity available to the Design-Builder depends on the Design-Builder's financial strength and track record.

**Guidance:**
- Confirm early (during proposal development) that the selected surety is Alberta-authorized and has bonding capacity for the estimated contract value (typically 100% coverage of contract price in aggregate, supporting 50%+50% bonds).
- If bonding capacity is limited, consider partnering with a larger firm or co-bonding arrangement (consult surety for options).
- In DEL-01-06, identify the surety by name and Alberta authorization status to demonstrate due diligence: e.g., "Bonds to be issued by [Surety Name], Alberta-authorized bond issuer."
- **Risk:** Failure to obtain valid bonding is automatic disqualification. Do not proceed to submission without surety confirmation.

---

### C-003: Insurance Coverage Scope and Additional Insured Status

**Context:**
Appendix J SC 50–52 governs the minimum required insurance coverage scope. The requirement to add the Town of Penhold as additional insured on GL and Builder's Risk policies increases administrative burden and marginally increases premium cost.

**Guidance:**
- Confirm with insurance broker that standard Design-Build CCIP packages include additional insured endorsements for the Owner/Town as a standard feature.
- Cost additional insured endorsements into the Schedule B "CCIP Project Insurance" line item. ASSUMPTION: additional insured endorsement is typically a modest add-on to base GL premium.
- In DEL-01-06, state: "Town of Penhold will be named as additional insured on General Liability and Builder's Risk policies per Appendix J SC 50–52 requirements."
- Confirm specific minimum coverage limits and deductible requirements by reading Appendix J SC 50–52 clause text prior to finalizing Schedule B insurance line item.

---

### C-004: Workers' Compensation — Exemption vs. Inclusion

**Context:**
In Alberta, certain self-employed principals or business structures may qualify for Workers' Compensation (WC) coverage exemption. If exempt, WC cost can be excluded from Schedule B, reducing cost.

**Guidance:**
- Confirm with insurance broker or WC authority whether the Design-Builder's firm structure qualifies for WC exemption in Alberta.
- If WC-exempt: State in DEL-01-06 that WC cost is not included in the CCIP insurance line item, and provide a brief explanatory note (e.g., "WC exemption applies per Alberta Workers' Compensation Act for principals of [firm type]").
- If WC-required: Include full WC cost in Schedule B "CCIP Project Insurance" line item.
- Check whether Appendix J SC 52 mandates WC coverage regardless of exemption eligibility — Appendix J governs if more restrictive.

---

### C-005: Insurance Market Volatility and Cost Certainty Commitment

**Context:**
Insurance markets can experience rate changes between proposal submission and award. RFP requires fixed pricing. The proponent commits to insurance costs at proposal time, absorbing any market movement.

**Guidance:**
- Obtain insurance broker quotes **as close to the proposal deadline as possible** (ideally within 2–3 weeks) so that the quote reflects current market conditions.
- Do not apply a contingency uplift to the broker quote in Schedule B — use the broker's figure directly. **Clarification (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md E-001; SectionRef: Guidance C-005 paragraphs 2-3):** This instruction means the Schedule B line item should reflect the broker's quoted figure without a separately identified contingency markup. However, the proponent's internal commercial decision on how to assess and absorb the post-award market risk (see Risk Assessment Guidance above) is a separate matter from the Schedule B presentation. The broker's quote itself should be obtained as close to the submission deadline as possible (see VER-007 in Specification) to minimize the exposure window. **Proposed Authority:** Commercial Lead.
- In DEL-01-06, include: "Insurance costs are based on preliminary broker quotes dated [date]. Final insurance costs will be confirmed at contract execution; any market-driven cost increase post-award is the Design-Builder's responsibility and is not subject to contract price adjustment."
- **Risk:** If insurance market hardens significantly between proposal and award, the proponent absorbs the cost. This is the inherent risk of a firm fixed-price Design-Build proposal.

**Risk Assessment Guidance (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md D-001; SectionRef: Guidance C-005):**
- To bound the insurance market volatility risk, Commercial Lead should assess: (a) historical premium variation for comparable Design-Build projects over the expected proposal-to-award period (typically 2-6 months), (b) current insurance market cycle indicators (hardening vs. softening), and (c) the magnitude of potential premium increase as a percentage of total CCIP cost.
- If the assessed risk magnitude is material (e.g., >5% of CCIP cost), discuss with the Proposal Manager whether an internal risk margin within the CCIP line item is appropriate, noting that Guidance P-002 and this section instruct against a visible contingency uplift on the broker quote. The decision on how to price this absorbed risk is a commercial judgment. **Proposed Authority:** Commercial Lead.
- **ASSUMPTION:** This guidance assumes the proposal-to-award period is short enough that insurance market conditions will not shift materially. If the award timeline is uncertain or extended, reassess.

## Trade-Offs

### T-001: Bond Premium Cost vs. Non-Negotiable Compliance Requirement

**Trade-off:** Bond premiums (50%+50% of contract price) are a mandatory cost imposed by RFP Constraint C-08. There is no negotiation room on the bond structure (percentage or bond type). Higher contract values produce higher bond premiums.

**Resolution:**
Accept the 50%/50% split as a fixed, non-negotiable requirement. Ensure surety premium costs are budgeted and embedded in Schedule B General Requirements. Do not attempt to reduce bond amounts — this would create non-compliance.

---

### T-002: CCIP Cost vs. OCIP Alternative

**Trade-off:** Under OCIP (Owner Controlled Insurance Program), the Town would procure and pay for project insurance, removing insurance cost from the proponent's proposal. Under CCIP (confirmed per DEC-011), the Design-Builder bears all insurance cost and procurement responsibility, increasing the bid price.

**Resolution:**
CCIP is confirmed per DEC-011 (OI-003 closed). The proponent must include CCIP costs in Schedule B and Schedule A. The advantage to the proponent is full control of the insurance program; the advantage to the Town is that insurance procurement risk sits with the party designing and building the project.

---

### T-003: Minimum Coverage vs. Enhanced Coverage

**Trade-off:** Broader insurance coverage (higher limits, broader additional insured endorsements, pollution liability, professional liability extension, etc.) increases CCIP cost. Appendix J SC 50–52 specifies minimum required coverage. Exceeding minimums benefits risk management but increases proposal price.

**Resolution:**
Price Schedule B insurance line item to meet **minimum Appendix J SC 50–52 requirements**. If the proponent chooses to exceed minimums (for firm risk management reasons), absorb the additional cost within the Schedule B line item and note in DEL-01-06 if materially different from minimum coverage.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Bond Amount Calculation and Schedule B Placement

**Scenario:**
Schedule A line 1-1 (base contract price, locked final) = $8,500,000

**Bond Calculations:**
- Performance Bond = 50% × $8,500,000 = $4,250,000
- Payment Bond = 50% × $8,500,000 = $4,250,000

**Surety Quote (illustrative; ASSUMPTION: rates are example only):**
- Performance Bond premium: $4,250,000 × 1.2% = $51,000
- Payment Bond premium: $4,250,000 × 0.8% = $34,000
- **Total bond premium cost = $85,000**

**Schedule B Entry:**

| Line Item | Qty | Unit | Unit Cost | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Performance & Payment Bond Premiums | 1 | LS | $85,000 | $85,000 |

**DEL-01-06 Bonding Statement:**
"The Design-Builder will provide an executed Agreement to Bond issued by [Surety Name], Alberta-authorized. Performance Bond: $4,250,000 (50% of $8,500,000 base contract price). Labour & Materials Payment Bond: $4,250,000 (50% of $8,500,000 base contract price). Bond premium cost of $85,000 is included in Schedule B General Requirements and in Schedule A line 1-1 base contract price."

### Example 2: CCIP Insurance Cost Estimation and Schedule B Placement

**Scenario:**
Design-Build project timeline: 6 months design + 18 months construction + 12 months warranty = 36 months total.

**Insurance Broker Quote (illustrative; ASSUMPTION: values are example only):**

| Coverage | Period | Annual Estimate | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| General Liability (incl. Additional Insured endorsement for Town) | 3 years | $150,000 | $450,000 |
| Builder's Risk / Course of Construction | 2 years | $200,000 | $400,000 |
| Automobile Liability | 3 years | $50,000 | $150,000 |
| Workers' Compensation (8% of estimated payroll $1,000,000/yr) | 2.5 years | $80,000 | $200,000 |
| **Total CCIP Insurance** | — | — | **$1,200,000** |

**Schedule B Entry:**

| Line Item | Qty | Unit | Unit Cost | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CCIP Project Insurance (GL, Builder's Risk, Auto, WC) | 1 | LS | $1,200,000 | $1,200,000 |

**DEL-01-06 CCIP Statement:**
"Insurance Approach: CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) per Appendix J SC 50–52. The Design-Builder will procure and maintain all project insurance from contract execution through the 12-month warranty period. Coverages include: General Liability ($450K, 3 years), Builder's Risk ($400K, 2 years), Auto Liability ($150K, 3 years), Workers' Compensation ($200K, 2.5 years). Town of Penhold will be named as additional insured on GL and Builder's Risk policies. Total CCIP insurance cost: $1,200,000, included as a fixed amount in Schedule B General Requirements and in Schedule A line 1-1 base contract price. No post-award adjustment will be made for insurance market changes. Certificates of Insurance will be provided prior to site mobilization."

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

*Two conflicts identified during Pass 3 semantic lensing enrichment. Both require human ruling before finalization.*

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CT-001 | **Agreement to Bond vs. Fully Executed Bond:** RFP 5.3.1 requires an "Agreement to Bond" which may be a surety pre-commitment letter rather than fully executed bond instruments at proposal stage. Procedure N-001 flags this ambiguity, but Datasheet (Conditions "Execution Requirement") and Specification R-001 ("Submission" row) assume full execution is required at submission. The distinction is consequential for procurement timeline and compliance. | Procedure.md Note N-001 (Agreement to Bond = possibly pre-commitment letter) | Datasheet.md Conditions "Execution Requirement" row + Specification.md R-001 "Submission" row (assume executed document) | Datasheet: Conditions; Specification: R-001; Procedure: Steps 5 and 7 | RFP Section 5.3.1 / Town RFP administrator (PROPOSAL) | TBD |
| CT-002 | **Payment Bond Beneficiary — Definitive vs. Potential Naming:** Datasheet originally stated "Lien claimants; Town of Penhold may also be named" (potential), while Specification R-001 stated "Lien claimants + Town of Penhold" (definitive). The distinction is legally significant for the Payment Bond beneficiary clause. Both documents now reference this conflict table entry pending resolution. | Datasheet.md Construction, Payment Bond "Beneficiary" (original: "may also be named") | Specification.md R-001 "Beneficiary" row (original: "Lien claimants + Town of Penhold" definitive) | Datasheet: Construction Artifact 1 Payment Bond; Specification: R-001 Beneficiary row | RFP Section 5.3.1 / Appendix J SC 51 (PROPOSAL) | TBD |

---

## Summary

DEL-01-03 ensures that bonding and insurance are treated as **compliant, transparent, fixed-cost commitments** in the proposal, not afterthoughts or administrative items.

Two key principles govern execution:

1. **Bond execution (50%+50%) is mandatory and non-negotiable** — Obtain surety commitment early; confirm Alberta authorization; calculate amounts from final Schedule A line 1-1; embed bonding premium in Schedule B General Requirements.

2. **CCIP insurance costs are fixed and explicit** — Obtain insurance broker quotes; state CCIP approach clearly in Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06); confirm all costs embedded in Schedule A base price with no post-award adjustment.

**Success criteria for this deliverable:**
- Valid executed bond document is included in proposal submission
- CCIP insurance approach is stated and costed in DEL-01-06
- Bond premium + CCIP insurance = explicit separate line items in Schedule B
- Schedule A line 1-1 = sum of all Schedule B line items (including bonds + insurance)
- DEL-01-06 explicitly confirms both are fixed, included, and not subject to post-award adjustment
- DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix) marks both as "PASS" with evidence references
