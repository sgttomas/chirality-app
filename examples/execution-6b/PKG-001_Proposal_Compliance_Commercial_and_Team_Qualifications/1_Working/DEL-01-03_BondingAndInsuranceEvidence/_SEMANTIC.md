# Deliverable: DEL-01-03 Bonding and Insurance Evidence

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to demonstrate that a proponent's financial security commitments — surety-backed bonding and contractor-controlled insurance — are mandatory, compliant, and transparently embedded in proposal pricing. It must carry knowledge about the structure, cost treatment, and cross-document integrity of performance guarantees and risk-transfer mechanisms that satisfy both pass/fail compliance gates and pricing reasonableness expectations.
