### R-002: CCIP Insurance Approach — Confirmation and Cost Treatment

**Requirement Statement:**

### R-003: Bond Cost Inclusion in Pricing

| **Cost Basis** | Bond premium estimate based on surety quote; ASSUMPTION: quote obtained during proposal development phase |
| **Premium Calculation** | Bond premium = (Performance Bond Amount × surety rate %) + (Payment Bond Amount × surety rate %); rates typically 0.5–2.0% of bond amount depending on Design-Builder financial strength and project risk profile |
| **Inclusion Rule** | Bond costs are part of the base contract price; not an additional option or contingency |
| **Cross-Document Consistency** | Schedule A line 1-1 base price total must incorporate all Schedule B line items including bonding costs; no unexplained gap |

## Summary

DEL-01-03 mandates two compliance deliverables with pass/fail consequences:

1. **Executed Agreement to Bond** — Binding surety-backed document committing 50% performance bond + 50% payment bond coverage; amounts calculated from final Schedule A line 1-1 price; Alberta-authorized surety; duly executed and included with proposal submission.

2. **CCIP Insurance Approach Statement** — Clear declaration that the Design-Builder will implement CCIP per Appendix J SC 50–52; all insurance costs fixed, embedded in proposal pricing, and confirmed in the Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06).

Both artifacts must be consistent across Schedule A (DEL-01-04), Schedule B (DEL-01-05), Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06), and Compliance Matrix (DEL-01-01). Any inconsistency or omission constitutes a compliance deficiency with potential disqualification risk.
