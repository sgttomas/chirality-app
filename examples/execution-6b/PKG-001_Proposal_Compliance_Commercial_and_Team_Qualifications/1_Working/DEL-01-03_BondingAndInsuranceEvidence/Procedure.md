## Prerequisites

### PR-001: Schedule A Near-Final Base Price Available

**Prerequisite:**
DEL-01-04 (Schedule A Pricing Summary) must have a final or near-final (within ±5%) base contract price on line 1-1. Bond amounts are calculated as 50% of this total; estimating bond premiums requires a reasonably locked estimate.

**Verification:**
- Estimator provides Proposal Manager with final or "80% locked" Schedule A line 1-1 total
- Proposal Manager acknowledges estimate is sufficient to proceed with surety and insurance quotes

---

### PR-002: Surety Pre-Qualification

**Prerequisite:**
Identify and pre-qualify a primary surety (and backup if necessary) that is:
- Alberta-authorized to issue performance and payment bonds
- Willing to bond the Design-Builder at the estimated contract value
- Capable of delivering bond documents within the proposal timeline

**Verification:**
- Proposal Manager has confirmed surety Alberta authorization status
- Surety has indicated willingness and capacity to bond for this project size
- Initial contact with surety is documented

---

### PR-003: Insurance Broker Engagement

**Prerequisite:**
Retain an insurance broker with experience in Design-Build CCIP project insurance to:
- Understand Appendix J SC 50–52 insurance requirements
- Prepare a preliminary insurance scope (GL, Builder's Risk, Auto, WC, Additional Insured)
- Obtain market quotes for the full project period (design + construction + 12-month warranty)

**Verification:**
- Proposal Manager or Commercial Lead has identified and engaged an insurance broker
- Broker has confirmed understanding of RFP Appendix J requirements
- Broker has committed to deliver quotes within the proposal timeline

---

### PR-004: Schedule B Template Available (DEL-01-05)

**Prerequisite:**
DEL-01-05 (Schedule B Cost Breakdown) must be available in draft or template form so that bonding and insurance line items can be added to the General Requirements section.

**Verification:**
- Estimator has provided Schedule B template or draft to Proposal Manager
- General Requirements section has space for new bonding and insurance line items

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Calculate Preliminary Bond Amounts and Obtain Surety Quote

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager
**Timing:** As soon as Schedule A line 1-1 is near-final (PR-001 satisfied)

**Action:**
1. Calculate preliminary bond amounts:
   - Performance Bond amount = 50% × Schedule A line 1-1 (near-final estimate)
   - Payment Bond amount = 50% × Schedule A line 1-1 (near-final estimate)

2. Submit bond request to selected surety, providing:
   - Design-Builder legal name, corporate structure, and financial references
   - Project description: Public Services Building, Design-Build per CCDC 14-2013 with Appendix J Supplementary Conditions; Town of Penhold, Alberta
   - Estimated contract value (Schedule A line 1-1 near-final)
   - Bond amounts (Performance 50% + Payment 50%)
   - Requested bond forms (ASSUMPTION: CCDC-19 and CCDC-20, or equivalent; confirm with surety)
   - Required timeline (bond quotes and executed documents needed by [date prior to submission])

3. Surety provides:
   - Premium rate quote for Performance Bond and Payment Bond
   - Total bond premium calculation
   - Confirmation of bonding capacity and willingness to issue
   - Preliminary bond form (blank form for review, if required)

4. Proposal Manager records surety quote and calculates total bond premium cost.

**Verification:**
- Written surety quote received (email or formal quote letter) with rate and total premium amount
- Surety has confirmed bonding capacity for the project

**Contingency — Surety Decline or Capacity Shortfall (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md C-001; SectionRef: Procedure Steps 1 and 5; Guidance C-002):**
If the primary surety declines bonding capacity or cannot deliver executed bonds within the proposal timeline:
1. Immediately engage backup surety (identified during PR-002 pre-qualification). If no backup was pre-qualified, begin emergency surety search.
2. If backup surety is also unavailable, evaluate co-bonding arrangements per Guidance C-002 (partnering with a larger firm to share bonding capacity).
3. If neither primary, backup, nor co-bonding is feasible within the submission timeline: escalate to Proposal Manager for a **go/no-go decision** on the proposal submission, as bonding is a mandatory compliance gate (C-08) with disqualification consequence.
4. Document the surety engagement outcome (accepted, declined, or contingency path taken) for audit trail.

---

### Step 2: Obtain CCIP Insurance Broker Quote

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager / Commercial Lead
**Timing:** In parallel with Step 1

**Action:**
1. Submit insurance request to selected broker, providing:
   - Project scope: Public Services Building, Design-Build per CCDC 14-2013 with Appendix J Supplementary Conditions; CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) approach confirmed
   - Project timeline: approximately 6 months design + 18 months construction + 12-month warranty = 36 months total
   - Estimated contract value (from Schedule A line 1-1)
   - Appendix J SC 50–52 requirements (provide relevant clause text)
   - Additional insured requirement: Town of Penhold to be named as additional insured on GL and Builder's Risk
   - Coverage types required: General Liability, Builder's Risk, Automobile Liability, Workers' Compensation (or exemption confirmation)

2. Broker provides:
   - Itemized CCIP insurance cost quote by coverage type and period
   - Confirmation that all mandatory SC 50–52 coverage types are included
   - Confirmation of additional insured endorsement availability and cost
   - Certificate of Insurance timeline (post-award pre-mobilization issuance commitment)

3. Proposal Manager / Commercial Lead reviews quote and extracts:
   - Total CCIP insurance cost for full project period
   - Confirmation that all Appendix J SC 50–52 minimum coverages are included

**Verification:**
- Written insurance broker quote received (email or PDF quote sheet) with itemized costs by coverage type
- Quote is dated within 2-3 weeks of submission deadline (reflects current market conditions); this is a formal acceptance criterion per Specification VER-007 (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-002)
- Quote explicitly includes Additional Insured endorsement for Town of Penhold
- **Workers' Compensation status determination:** Confirm whether WC coverage is included or exempt per Alberta Workers' Compensation Act; if Appendix J SC 52 mandates WC regardless of exemption eligibility, include WC cost. Record WC determination for Specification VER-006. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-001; SectionRef: Specification R-002 "Scope of Coverage"; Guidance C-004)

---

### Step 3: Add Bonding and Insurance Line Items to Schedule B (DEL-01-05)

**Responsible Party:** Estimator (with Proposal Manager oversight)
**Timing:** After Steps 1 and 2 are complete

**Action:**
1. Estimator updates Schedule B (DEL-01-05) General Requirements section to add two explicit line items:

   **Line Item A: "Performance & Payment Bond Premiums"**
   - Quantity: 1
   - Unit: Lump Sum
   - Unit Cost: [Bond premium total from Step 1]
   - Total: [Bond premium total]

   **Line Item B: "CCIP Project Insurance" (GL, Builder's Risk, Auto, WC)**
   - Quantity: 1
   - Unit: Lump Sum
   - Unit Cost: [Total CCIP insurance cost from Step 2]
   - Total: [Total CCIP insurance cost]

2. Estimator recalculates Schedule B total to include the two new line items.

3. Estimator updates Schedule A line 1-1 (base contract price) to equal the revised Schedule B total, ensuring Schedule A/B consistency.

**Verification:**
- Schedule B updated with two labeled line items for bonding and insurance
- Schedule B total = updated Schedule A line 1-1 base price (zero variance)
- Both documents are version-controlled and dated

---

### Step 4: Draft CCIP Insurance Approach Statement (for DEL-01-06)

**Responsible Party:** Commercial Lead
**Timing:** After Step 2 is complete (insurance quote received)

**Action:**
1. Commercial Lead drafts a CCIP Insurance Approach Statement for inclusion in DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions). Statement shall include:

   **CCIP Insurance Approach section:**
   - Confirm: CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) per Appendix J SC 50–52
   - State: Design-Builder procures and maintains all project insurance from contract execution through 12-month warranty
   - State: Town of Penhold named as additional insured on GL and Builder's Risk per SC 50–52
   - State: Total CCIP insurance cost = $[X] (per Schedule B line item "CCIP Project Insurance")
   - State: Insurance costs are FIXED and included in Schedule A line 1-1 base price; no post-award adjustment
   - State: Certificates of Insurance to be provided to Town prior to site mobilization; final policies in place at contract execution

   **Bonding Statement section:**
   - State: Executed Agreement to Bond to be provided per RFP 5.3.1 (C-08)
   - State: Surety: [Surety Name], Alberta-authorized
   - State: Performance Bond: 50% of Contract Price ($[A])
   - State: Labour & Materials Payment Bond: 50% of Contract Price ($[A])
   - State: Total bond premium: $[Z] (included in Schedule B General Requirements)
   - State: Bond documents executed and provided with proposal submission (or separately transmitted per RFP 5.3.1)

2. Commercial Lead ensures dollar amounts in statement match Schedule A and Schedule B figures.

**Verification:**
- Draft statement reviewed by Proposal Manager for accuracy and completeness
- Dollar amounts in DEL-01-06 draft match Schedule A line 1-1 and Schedule B line items
- No contradictions between statement and pricing documents

---

### Step 5: Finalize and Execute Bond Document

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager + Surety
**Timing:** After Schedule A line 1-1 is **fully finalized** (not just near-final)

**Action:**
1. Once Schedule A line 1-1 is locked and final, Proposal Manager notifies surety with final bond amounts:
   - Performance Bond amount = 50% × final Schedule A line 1-1
   - Payment Bond amount = 50% × final Schedule A line 1-1

2. Surety prepares executed bond document(s):
   - Agreement to Bond (CCDC-19 Performance Bond + CCDC-20 Payment Bond, or surety equivalent per Appendix J SC 50)
   - Document signed and sealed by surety authorized signatory and Design-Builder authorized signatory
   - Document names Town of Penhold as beneficiary
   - Document specifies correct bond amounts, Design-Builder legal name, project description

3. Surety provides to Proposal Manager:
   - Executed bond PDF(s) (scanned or digital copy of signed/sealed document)
   - Certificate of bond issuance (confirmation of surety commitment)

4. Proposal Manager reviews executed bond document for accuracy:
   - Correct beneficiary: Town of Penhold (verify legal name spelling)
   - Correct bond amounts: Performance = 50% of final Schedule A; Payment = 50% of final Schedule A
   - Authorized surety signature and corporate seal visible
   - Correct Design-Builder legal name (matching proposal signature block)
   - No blank or incomplete fields

**Verification:**
- Executed bond PDF received from surety
- Proposal Manager review checklist completed (all four accuracy items above confirmed)
- Bond amounts match final Schedule A line 1-1 × 50%

---

### Step 6: Update Compliance Matrix (DEL-01-01)

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager
**Timing:** After Steps 4 and 5 are complete

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager updates DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix and Checklist) with bonding and insurance verification:

   | Requirement | RFP Ref | Status | Evidence | Notes |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Agreement to Bond (Performance + Payment) | RFP 5.3.1 / C-08 | PASS / INCLUDED | Executed bond document, Surety [Name], dated [X] | Performance Bond: $[A]; Payment Bond: $[A] |
   | CCIP Insurance Approach | RFP 9.14 / Appendix J SC 50–52 | PASS / STATED | DEL-01-06 Insurance Approach Statement, section [Y] | CCIP costs $[B] included in Schedule A line 1-1 |

2. Proposal Manager confirms both items are marked as PASS in the compliance gate review.

3. **Surety name consistency check (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md X-003; SectionRef: Specification VER-005):** Verify that the surety company name is stated identically across:
   - Executed bond document (DEL-01-03 Artifact 1)
   - DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative — bonding statement)
   - DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix — bonding row "Notes" or "Evidence" column)
   Any discrepancy in surety name constitutes a compliance defect and must be corrected before submission.

**Verification:**
- Compliance Matrix updated with both bonding and insurance rows
- Both marked as PASS/INCLUDED with specific evidence references
- Compliance gate for DEL-01-03 is confirmed

---

### Step 7: Package Documents for Proposal Submission

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager
**Timing:** Final pre-submission step; after all Steps 1–6 are complete

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager collects and verifies all final documents:
   - Executed Agreement to Bond PDF(s) — from Step 5
   - DEL-01-04 (Schedule A) — final locked version
   - DEL-01-05 (Schedule B) — final version with bonding and CCIP insurance line items
   - DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative) — final version with CCIP and bonding statements
   - DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix) — final version with bonding/insurance marked PASS

2. Determine placement of executed bond document per RFP 5.3.1:
   - **Option A (Preferred):** Include executed bond PDF in main proposal PDF (confirm it fits within 15 MB size limit per RFP 4.2)
   - **Option B (Alternate):** Transmit executed bond as a separate PDF attachment in the same email submission per RFP 5.3.1 (if main PDF size requires separation)

3. **File size verification (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md X-001; SectionRef: Procedure Step 7 Action item 2; Specification R-001 "Submission" row):**
   - If Option A is selected: measure the combined proposal PDF file size (main proposal + embedded bond document). Confirm total is below 15 MB per RFP 4.2.
   - If combined file exceeds 15 MB: switch to Option B (separate bond PDF attachment).
   - Record the final file size and selected option in the pre-submission checklist.

4. Final verification sweep:
   - Executed bond present in submission package (Option A or B)
   - Schedule A line 1-1 = Schedule B total (zero variance)
   - Schedule B includes explicit bonding and CCIP insurance line items
   - DEL-01-06 explicitly states both bonding and CCIP costs are fixed and included
   - DEL-01-01 marks both requirements as PASS with evidence references
   - No version inconsistencies across any of the four cross-referenced documents

**Verification:**
- Final pre-submission checklist completed with all items confirmed
- All four documents (DEL-01-01, DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05, DEL-01-06) are consistent and final
- Executed bond document is verified present and will be included/transmitted

## Summary

The procedure for DEL-01-03 is a seven-step, verification-intensive workflow that ensures bonding and insurance compliance is achieved through:

1. **Quantification** (surety and broker quotes obtained; premium costs calculated — Steps 1 and 2)
2. **Integration** (bonding and insurance line items added to Schedule B — Step 3)
3. **Declaration** (CCIP approach stated in DEL-01-06 with explicit cost amounts and fixedness confirmation — Step 4)
4. **Execution** (bond document executed by surety and reviewed for accuracy — Step 5)
5. **Compliance gate** (Compliance Matrix updated; both requirements marked PASS — Step 6)
6. **Submission packaging** (all documents assembled and verified consistent — Step 7)

**Critical pre-submission checklist:**
- [ ] Surety bond premium quote obtained and bond premium calculated (Step 1)
- [ ] Insurance broker CCIP quote obtained and total cost calculated (Step 2)
- [ ] Schedule B updated with explicit bonding and insurance line items (Step 3)
- [ ] Schedule A line 1-1 updated to equal revised Schedule B total (Step 3)
- [ ] DEL-01-06 includes explicit CCIP approach statement and bonding statement with dollar amounts confirmed fixed (Step 4)
- [ ] Executed bond document obtained from surety and verified valid (Step 5)
- [ ] DEL-01-01 Compliance Matrix marks both requirements as PASS (Step 6)
- [ ] All four cross-referenced documents (DEL-01-01, DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05, DEL-01-06) are consistent and final (Step 7)
- [ ] Executed bond document is included in proposal submission package (Step 7)

## Notes

**N-001 — Bond Execution vs. Agreement to Bond:**
The RFP requires an "Agreement to Bond" — a commitment by the surety to issue bonds upon award, not necessarily the fully executed bond instruments themselves at proposal stage. Confirm with the Town/RFP administrator whether the Agreement to Bond (a pre-commitment letter) or fully executed bond forms are required at proposal submission. If only an Agreement to Bond (commitment letter) is required, this is easier to procure at proposal stage; full bond instruments are issued post-award. The procedure above assumes full execution is required at submission; adjust if Agreement to Bond = pre-commitment letter only.

**N-002 — Appendix J SC 50–52 Clause Text:**
Appendix J clause text was not fully accessed during this procedure's preparation. Before finalizing Schedule B insurance line items, confirm the specific minimum coverage limits, deductible requirements, and additional insured wording in SC 50–52. Material departures from SC 50–52 minimums create compliance risk.

**N-003 — Timeline Pressure:**
Surety bond execution and insurance broker quotes both require lead time. If the proposal development timeline is compressed, prioritize surety and insurance engagement as early as possible — ideally in the first week of active proposal work. Bond execution is on the critical path to submission.
