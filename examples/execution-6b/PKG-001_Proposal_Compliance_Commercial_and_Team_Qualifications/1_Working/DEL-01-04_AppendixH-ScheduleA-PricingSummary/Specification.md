### Excluded

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification Method | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-SA-01 | Side-by-side comparison of completed Schedule A to RFP Appendix H template (pp. 57-58); confirm no field added, removed, renamed, or reordered | Proposal Compliance Officer |
| REQ-SA-02 | Line 1-1 contains a populated dollar value; cross-check against Schedule B "Subtotal Item 1" | Estimator |
| REQ-SA-03 | All 6 additional option lines (1-2 through 1-7) contain a value or explicit N/A; no line left blank | Proposal Compliance Officer |
| REQ-SA-04 | Confirm Line 1-7 = $20,000.00 exactly | Finance |
| REQ-SA-05 | Confirm Line 1-1 does not include any FF&E allowance; cross-check against Schedule B cost model | Estimator |
| REQ-SA-06 | Verify currency notation (CAD $) and two decimal places on all lines. **Note (C-001):** Because this requirement is sourced as ASSUMPTION (no explicit RFP clause), verification should confirm the expected format standard is approved by Estimator / Commercial Lead or PM before treating non-conformance as a failure. Confirm the expected format: "$X,XXX.XX" with comma separators and two decimal places throughout. | Finance |
| REQ-SA-07 | Confirm a separate tax line is present with a calculated value (not embedded in line amounts) | Finance |
| REQ-SA-08 | Confirm all three addenda acknowledged; addenda field reads "Addendum 01 to 03" or equivalent; all three addenda numbered and dated | Proposal Compliance Officer |
| REQ-SA-09 | Open Schedule B; verify line 1-1 = Schedule B "Subtotal Item 1"; verify each option line matches Schedule B Additional Item subtotals | Finance + Estimator (reconciliation table -- see Procedure Step 4) |
| REQ-SA-10 | Confirm bond cost line is present in Schedule B General Requirements; confirm bond costs are included in Schedule B Subtotal Item 1 and therefore in Schedule A line 1-1 | Finance + DEL-01-03 cross-check |
| REQ-SA-11 | Confirm CCIP insurance cost is included in Schedule B General Requirements; included in Schedule B Subtotal Item 1 and therefore in Schedule A line 1-1 | Finance + DEC-011 cross-check |
| REQ-SA-12 | Confirm no site service tie-in amounts appear in Line 1-1 or Schedule B base requirements (or that cash allowance treatment is documented in DEL-01-06) | Estimator + DEL-01-06 cross-check |
| REQ-SA-13 | Authorized signature present on Schedule A; handwritten per §5.2(a); execution form verified (corporate/individual/partnership/joint venture as applicable). **Note (A-002):** RFP §5.2(a) requires handwritten signatures. Electronic signatures are not explicitly authorized in the RFP. If the proponent uses electronic signature, acceptance as equivalent to handwritten must be confirmed by Proposal Compliance Officer / Legal before execution. The e-signature platform must produce an auditable record. Acceptance determination is **TBD** pending human ruling. | Proposal Compliance Officer + Legal (if e-signature used) |
| REQ-SA-14 | Schedule A positioned in Section 8 of proposal PDF; final PDF submission file size < 15 MB | Proposal Coordinator |
| REQ-SA-15 | If alternatives included, they are on a separate page/section and do not modify the standard pricing lines | Proposal Compliance Officer |
| REQ-SA-16 | If Schedule A is scanned from paper, confirm scan resolution >= 300 dpi; text, values, and signature are legible in final PDF | Proposal Coordinator |
