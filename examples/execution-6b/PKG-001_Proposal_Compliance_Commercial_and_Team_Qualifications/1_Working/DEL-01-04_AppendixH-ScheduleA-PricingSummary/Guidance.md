# Guidance — DEL-01-04: Appendix H - Schedule A - Pricing Summary

---

## Purpose

Schedule A is the **executive pricing summary** of the proposal. It is the single form the Owner's Evaluation Committee uses to read the proponent's total price, compare competing bids on a standardized basis, and apply the 35-point "Proposal Price (Appendix H)" criterion — the highest-weighted single criterion in the evaluation at 35 of 100 total points.

Schedule A succeeds when it is:
1. Complete on all 7 pricing lines (no blanks)
2. Mathematically consistent with Schedule B
3. Taxes shown separately as required
4. All three addenda explicitly acknowledged
5. FF&E separated as Additional Option 6 ($20,000 cash allowance per DEC-012)
6. Signed by an authorized proponent representative with handwritten signature

## Principles

### P-001: Template Fidelity

Do not alter the RFP-provided Appendix H layout. The Owner's evaluation process is organized around the template structure (lines 1-1 through 1-7, specific labels, addenda field, signature block). Deviating from the template format -- including renaming lines, adding lines, or changing label text -- risks non-compliance review and possible disqualification.

**Source:** RFP §4.3, p. 13 ("Each Proponent shall use the Financial Proposal template included in Appendix H"); C-05

### P-002: Every Line Must Be Addressed

Leave no line blank. Options not being offered should be explicitly marked (e.g., N/A or $0). A blank line creates ambiguity for the evaluator and may suggest an incomplete submission. Even if an option is not recommended, pricing it demonstrates scope comprehension and gives the Owner flexibility post-evaluation.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 57 (template structure; no guidance provided for leaving lines blank); ASSUMPTION: standard practice for public-sector RFP compliance

### P-003: FF&E as a Distinctly Separated Item

Addendum 03 §1.18 states verbatim: "FF&E can be included as an additional item in the proposal but should not be included in the base costs so the evaluation team can accurately evaluate the construction of the building." Line 1-7 ($20,000 cash allowance per DEC-012) must not commingle with Line 1-1. The separation is structurally important: the Owner uses the base price to compare construction costs across proponents on a like-for-like basis.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.18, p. 4; DEC-012 (OI-002 resolution); C-11

### P-004: Addenda Acknowledgement is Non-Negotiable

RFP Appendix H, p. 57 states: "Failure to acknowledge receipt and inclusion of all addenda may result in this Price Proposal being disqualified, at the discretion of the Owner." All three addenda (01, 02, 03) must be acknowledged. The template field reads "Addenda ___ to ___"; completing it as "Addendum 01 to 03" satisfies this requirement. Addendum 03 contains the most material changes including the FF&E treatment, site servicing allowance, and Pickled Sand Storage exclusion -- all of which have direct pricing implications.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 57 (verbatim); RFP §2.9, p. 11; C-07

### P-005: The Price is a Binding Firm-Price Offer

The Schedule A price is the "Total Firm Price" submitted by the proponent. Post-submission changes are not permitted except through revised proposals submitted before the Closing Date (August 30, 2024 at 2:00 PM MST) with the revision number clearly indicated per RFP §5.3, p. 14. The authorized signature on Schedule A constitutes the proponent's binding offer. The proponent's submission is irrevocable during the Validity Period per Appendix G (Letter of Offer).

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 57 (preamble: "following Total Firm Price"); RFP §5.3, p. 14; RFP Appendix G, p. 56

### Terminology Note (B-003): "Total Firm Price" vs. "Total Stipulated Price"

The RFP Appendix H uses two terms for the same amount: the Schedule A preamble refers to the "**Total Firm Price**" while the addenda acknowledgement field refers to the "**Total Stipulated Price**." Both terms denote the same aggregate contract price submitted by the proponent on Schedule A. Users of these documents should treat the two terms as synonymous in this RFP context. This normalization note prevents misinterpretation by downstream reviewers or team members who encounter both phrases in verbatim RFP quotations across these documents.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 57 (preamble uses "Total Firm Price"; addenda field uses "Total Stipulated Price"); Datasheet.md Attributes (Form preamble row; Addenda acknowledgement row)

### P-006: Transparency Through Traceability

Every Schedule A line value must be fully traceable to a corresponding Schedule B source line. The Schedule B Subtotal Item 1 is the input for Line 1-1; each Additional Item subtotal is the input for its corresponding Lines 1-2 through 1-7. This prevents arithmetic errors and allows the Owner (or post-award auditors) to reconcile the executive summary against the detail. The Procedure reconciliation table (Step 4) formalizes this linkage.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 59 ("Subtotal Item 1 (to be entered in Schedule A)"); Decomposition cross-reference DEL-01-05

### P-007: Signature Compliance is a Completeness Requirement

RFP §5.2 states: "Failure to provide an authorized signature will result in the response being deemed incomplete." The signature must be in the signatory's own handwriting per §5.2(a).

**Clarification needed (A-002):** The current guidance uses hedged language regarding electronic signatures ("may be accepted"). RFP §5.2(a) explicitly requires handwritten signatures but does not explicitly authorize or prohibit electronic equivalents. The acceptance of electronic signatures as equivalent to handwritten signatures is **TBD** -- this must be confirmed by the Proposal Compliance Officer / Legal before choosing an e-signature approach. If electronic signature is used, the platform must produce an auditable record demonstrating the signature is traceable to the authorized individual and appears as a handwriting-equivalent mark. **When in doubt, obtain a wet-ink signature on a printed Schedule A** -- this is the only approach with zero compliance risk under §5.2(a).

## Considerations

### C-001: Price Competitiveness vs. Risk Adequacy

Schedule A carries the highest evaluation weight (35 points). The pricing formula is comparative: a lower price earns a higher score relative to competitors. However, the price must adequately cover the full scope including:
- Performance Bond (50% of Contract Price) + Labour and Material Payment Bond (50% of Contract Price) via Schedule B General Requirements
- CCIP insurance costs via Schedule B General Requirements (DEC-011)
- Design, engineering, and project management fees
- Appropriate design-build contingency for a complex integrated Fire Hall + Public Works Operations facility

Underbidding to gain price points creates delivery risk that can damage execution credibility and result in change-order disputes or claims. Overbidding surrenders price points unnecessarily. The correct approach is accurate cost modeling in Schedule B (DEL-01-05) with well-documented assumptions in the Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06).

**Source:** RFP §5.3.1, pp. 14-15 (bond costs); DEC-011 (CCIP); Decomposition OBJ-007; RFP §8.5, p. 28

### C-002: How Price Scoring Actually Works

The RFP does not publish the price scoring formula explicitly. The Scoring Matrix in §8.3 (pp. 26-27) applies percentage-based ratings to qualitative criteria (Exceptional = 100%, Excellent = 90%, Very Good = 80%, Good = 70%, Fair = 60%, Acceptable = 50%, Unacceptable = 0-40%). For the price criterion, the Owner's method is not described as a qualitative rating but as a comparative result: §8.6 (p. 28) states that in the event of a tie in total score, "the Owner will select the Proponent with the lowest price." This implies the price evaluation is a relative/comparative calculation.

**ASSUMPTION:** Standard Alberta public-sector price scoring typically normalizes scores against the lowest compliant price (e.g., lowest bid receives 35 points; other bids receive a pro-rated fraction). Proponents should optimize for value and accuracy rather than artificially low pricing that is not defensible.

**Open question (A-003):** The Owner's price scoring formula is not explicitly stated in the RFP. The Scoring Matrix in §8.3 describes qualitative criteria scoring but does not describe the price criterion method. Without knowing whether the formula is (a) normalized against lowest compliant price, (b) absolute cost bands, or (c) another method, the proponent's competitive positioning strategy cannot be fully validated. If a clarification opportunity exists (e.g., a pre-submission question period), consider requesting the Owner's price evaluation methodology. This is recorded as ASSUMPTION pending clarification.

**Source:** RFP §8.3, pp. 26-27 (scoring matrix for qualitative criteria); RFP §8.6, p. 28 (tie-breaking by lowest price); Decomposition OBJ-007 ("competitive, compliant price package")

### C-003: Optional Items Strategy

Options 1 through 5 (Wash Bay, Yard Lighting, Access Control, Security/Cameras, Signage for Exterior) should be priced whether or not the proponent is including them in a recommended scope bundle. The Owner wants the ability to add or remove options post-evaluation or in negotiation. Pricing all options demonstrates scope comprehension and gives the Owner flexibility.

Note: Option 4 (Security and Camera System) has two sub-components in Schedule B: "Security and Camera System" and "Monthly Monitoring Fee" (RFP Appendix H, p. 59). Both sub-components appear in Schedule B under Additional Item 4. The Schedule A line 1-5 represents the combined subtotal of both.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, pp. 57, 59; Decomposition vocabulary (Additional Options 1-6)

### C-004: Currency and Arithmetic Precision

Use consistent two decimal places throughout (e.g., $1,234,567.00). Inconsistent decimal usage (one line rounded to the dollar, another to the cent) signals lack of attention to detail. Arithmetic errors in the totals are a red flag for evaluation committees and can trigger clarification requests under §8.4, p. 28.

**Source:** Standard financial presentation practice -- ASSUMPTION

### C-005: GST Treatment in Alberta

GST in Alberta is 5%. There is no provincial sales tax (PST) in Alberta. For a public-sector construction contract, GST generally applies to the full contract price including options. The Schedule A template requires taxes shown separately; the tax line should reflect 5% GST on the applicable base.

**ASSUMPTION:** GST at 5% applies to the full contract price including selected options. Confirm with Finance/Legal before final submission. Note that some items may have different GST treatment (e.g., cash allowances may be taxed at disbursement rather than proposal stage -- confirm with Finance).

**Open question (A-001):** The prescriptive direction for GST treatment is incomplete. Specifically: (1) Does the 5% GST apply to the full contract price including cash allowance items such as FF&E ($20,000 on Line 1-7) and site servicing (Addendum 03 §1.7)? (2) Are cash allowances taxed at proposal stage or at disbursement? This question is recorded in Conflict Table C-001 and requires Finance / Legal confirmation before final submission.

**Source:** RFP §4.3, p. 13 (taxes shown separately); ASSUMPTION for GST rate and full applicability

### C-006: Post-Submission Error Correction (X-002)

If a reconciliation error or arithmetic mistake is discovered **after submission** but **before the Closing Date** (August 30, 2024 at 2:00:00 PM MST), the proponent may submit a revised proposal. RFP §5.3, p. 14 permits revised proposals up to the closing time, provided the revision number is clearly indicated. However, the Guidance and Procedure documents are currently silent on the implications and process for post-submission error correction. Key considerations:

1. **Permissibility:** Revised proposals are explicitly permitted per RFP §5.3.
2. **Process:** The revision must clearly indicate the revision number. The entire Schedule A (signed) should be resubmitted, not a partial correction.
3. **Risk:** Multiple revisions may signal to the Owner a lack of internal quality control; limit revisions to genuine errors only.
4. **Rationale gap:** The documents thoroughly cover pre-submission checks (Procedure Steps 4, 7) but do not address the remediation path if an error is found post-submission. This consideration fills that gap.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Base Price Inclusion of Scope vs. Additional Options

**Issue:** Some items could theoretically be bundled into Line 1-1 (base) or separated as options.

- **Bundled in base:** Lower perceived options cost; cleaner base price. Risk: if the Owner does not select a bundled scope item, the contract price cannot be reduced, and the Owner cannot accurately evaluate the "true" construction cost.
- **Separated as options:** Transparent; Owner can choose what to add. Aligns with the RFP template intent and Addendum 03 §1.18 requirement to keep FF&E out of base.

**Framework decision:** Follow the RFP template exactly. Lines 1-2 through 1-7 are defined by the Owner as Additional Options. Do not bundle options into the base unless they are genuinely base-scope items with no corresponding option line.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 57 (template defines which items are base vs. options); Addendum 03 §1.18, p. 4

### T-002: FF&E at $20K Lump Sum vs. Itemized Allowance

**Issue:** Should Line 1-7 itemize specific appliances or present a lump-sum cash allowance?

- **Lump sum ($20K cash allowance):** Selected approach per DEC-012. Simple, transparent, keeps flexibility for Owner to select appliances post-award. Keeps evaluation focused on construction cost differences between proponents.
- **Itemized appliances:** More detailed but may be unnecessarily prescriptive at RFP stage and could constrain post-award Owner flexibility in appliance selection.

**Framework decision:** $20,000 cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.18, p. 4 and DEC-012. This is a project-level decision already confirmed. Do not deviate.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.18, p. 4; DEC-012; Decomposition SOW-0005 notes

### T-003: Alternative Pricing Proposals

**Issue:** Should the proponent include pricing alternatives (value engineering or scope reduction ideas) in Appendix H per RFP §8.5?

- **Include alternatives:** Demonstrates innovation and value-consciousness; may provide the Owner negotiating leverage if base price exceeds the affordability limit. Covered by SOW-0031 (DEL-01-06).
- **Exclude alternatives:** Simpler; no risk of confusing the evaluator about what the base price covers.

**Framework:** The RFP permits alternatives "listed separately" in Appendix H (RFP §8.5, p. 28). If included, they must not overwrite or modify the standard 7 pricing lines. They are additive to, not replacements for, the template. REQ-SA-15 governs this.

**Alternatives handling guidance (C-002):** If the proponent decides to include alternative pricing proposals, the following sub-procedure applies:
1. **Format:** Alternatives must be presented on a separate page appended to Schedule A, clearly labeled as "Alternative Pricing Proposals" per RFP §8.5.
2. **Content:** Each alternative should include: (a) a brief description of the alternative approach or scope modification, (b) the price impact (savings or addition), and (c) any conditions or constraints.
3. **Template integrity:** The standard pricing lines 1-1 through 1-7 must remain unmodified. Alternatives are supplementary.
4. **Compliance checklist interaction:** The Step 7 compliance checklist (REQ-SA-15 row) should confirm that any alternatives are on a separate page and do not modify the standard lines.
5. **Rationale for inclusion or exclusion:** Document in the Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06) whether alternatives were offered and why, per SOW-0031.

**Note:** The detailed format, content expectations, and evaluation treatment of alternatives by the Owner are **TBD** -- the RFP does not specify how alternatives will be scored or considered beyond the general permission in §8.5.

## Examples

### Example 1: Correct Addenda Acknowledgement (from RFP template, p. 57)

The RFP Appendix H addenda section reads verbatim:
> "The Proponent acknowledges that they have received the following Addenda and have accounted for their contents in their Total Stipulated Price above: Addenda ___ to ___."

Correct completion: **"Addendum 01 to 03"**

This covers all three issued addenda:
- Addendum 01: July 11, 2024 (bidders meeting date correction; missing dimensions intentional)
- Addendum 02: July 15, 2024 (missing pages 62-63 is formatting error only; no missing information)
- Addendum 03: July 31, 2024 (12-acre site; pickled sand storage removed; FF&E treatment; site servicing allowance; technical clarifications)

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, p. 57; Decomposition §4 (Addenda Integration Summary)

### Example 2: Correct Schedule A to Schedule B Linkage

The Schedule B template (RFP Appendix H, p. 59) structure and its feeding relationship to Schedule A:

| Schedule B Line | Feeds Schedule A |
|---|---|
| "Subtotal Item 1 (to be entered in Schedule A)" | Line 1-1 (Base Contract) |
| Additional Item 1 -- Built in Wash Bay subtotal | Line 1-2 |
| Additional Item 2 -- Yard Lighting subtotal | Line 1-3 |
| Additional Item 3 -- Access Control subtotal | Line 1-4 |
| Additional Item 4 -- Security and Camera System subtotal (Security + Monthly Monitoring Fee) | Line 1-5 |
| Additional Item 5 -- Signage subtotal | Line 1-6 |
| Additional Item 6 -- Appliances subtotal | Line 1-7 (= $20,000.00) |

The Procedure reconciliation table in Step 4 confirms each link by comparing Schedule A values to their Schedule B source lines and documenting the match result.

**Source:** RFP Appendix H, pp. 57-59

### Example 3: Non-Compliant Schedule A (Bad Practice -- Avoid)

The following errors would each constitute a compliance failure:

| Error | Risk | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Leaving the addenda acknowledgement field blank | Disqualification at Owner's discretion | C-07; RFP Appendix H, p. 57 |
| Including FF&E in Line 1-1 base cost | Non-compliance with Addendum 03 §1.18 | C-11; Addendum 03 §1.18 |
| Entering an amount other than $20,000.00 on Line 1-7 | Deviates from DEC-012 confirmed decision | DEC-012 |
| Modifying the template by adding, removing, or renaming lines | Non-compliant template use | C-05; RFP §4.3 |
| Taxes embedded in line amounts rather than shown on a separate line | Non-compliance with §4.3 | RFP §4.3, p. 13 |
| Schedule A values that do not match Schedule B subtotals | Internal inconsistency; evaluator red flag | REQ-SA-09; RFP Appendix H, p. 59 |
| No signature or a non-handwritten signature without adequate authentication | Response deemed incomplete | RFP §5.2(a) |

| C-004 | **Pricing strategy vs. affordability limit (E-001):** Guidance C-001 advises against underbidding; the 35-point price weighting and tie-breaking rule (lowest price wins ties per RFP §8.6) create implicit competitive pressure to lower price; the Owner's affordability limit is undisclosed (RFP §8.5). No documented decision framework exists for determining the proponent's target price band relative to the unknown affordability ceiling while maintaining competitive positioning. | Guidance C-001 (risk adequacy -- avoid underbidding) | Datasheet Conditions (affordability limit undisclosed, RFP §8.5, p. 28); RFP §8.6, p. 28 (tie-breaking by lowest price) | C-001, C-002; Datasheet Conditions (Affordability limit); Schedule A Grand Total | Estimator / Commercial Lead + PM | TBD -- human must determine pricing strategy balancing competitive scoring against delivery risk and unknown affordability ceiling |
