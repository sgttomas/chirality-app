# Procedure — DEL-01-04: Appendix H - Schedule A - Pricing Summary

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes how to complete and validate Schedule A (the pricing summary page of Appendix H) for insertion into the proposal PDF submission. Schedule A synthesizes the detailed cost totals from Schedule B (DEL-01-05) and pricing assumptions from the Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06) into the binding one-page price summary submitted to the Owner.

**Success outcome:** Schedule A is complete on all 7 pricing lines, taxes shown separately, addenda acknowledged ("Addendum 01 to 03"), values reconciled 100% to Schedule B, signed by an authorized proponent representative with a handwritten signature, and integrated in the correct position of the compliant proposal PDF.

**Sources:** RFP Appendix H, pp. 57-58; RFP §4.3, p. 13; RFP §5.2, pp. 13-14; Decomposition DEL-01-04, SOW-0005; Hard Constraints C-01, C-02, C-05, C-07, C-08, C-11

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Extract Cost Totals from Schedule B

**Objective:** Pull the Schedule B subtotals that will populate each Schedule A line.

**Actions:**

1. Open the completed Schedule B (DEL-01-05) cost model
2. Extract the following values and record them in a staging table:

| Schedule A Line | Schedule B Source Line | Value |
|---|---|---|
| 1-1 (Base Contract) | "Subtotal Item 1 (to be entered in Schedule A)" | TBD |
| 1-2 (Option 1 -- Built in Wash Bay) | Additional Item 1 subtotal (Interior Structure + Pressure Washing Equipment) | TBD |
| 1-3 (Option 2 -- Yard Lighting) | Additional Item 2 subtotal (Yard Lighting including Install) | TBD |
| 1-4 (Option 3 -- Building Access Control) | Additional Item 3 subtotal (Access Control throughout Building) | TBD |
| 1-5 (Option 4 -- Security and Camera System) | Additional Item 4 subtotal (Security and Camera System + Monthly Monitoring Fee) | TBD |
| 1-6 (Option 5 -- Signage for Exterior) | Additional Item 5 subtotal (Town of Penhold Operations + Fire Department Signs) | TBD |
| 1-7 (Option 6 -- Appliances / FF&E) | Additional Item 6 (Appliances for Public Services Building) | $20,000.00 (confirmed per DEC-012) |
| Tax line | 5% GST on taxable contract price (base + selected options) | TBD |

3. Verify that Line 1-7 source in Schedule B = exactly $20,000.00 and is NOT included in Schedule B Subtotal Item 1
4. Verify that bond costs (Performance Bond 50% + Labour and Material Payment Bond 50%) are visible in Schedule B General Requirements as a distinct line item
5. Verify that CCIP insurance costs are visible in Schedule B General Requirements as a distinct line item
6. Sign-off: Estimator confirms values are accurate and match the finalized cost model

**Output:** Staging table with all Schedule A line values and their Schedule B sources ready for template entry

---

### Step 2: Complete the Schedule A Template

**Objective:** Populate the RFP-provided Appendix H Schedule A form with the extracted values.

**Actions:**

1. Open the RFP Appendix H PDF (page 57) or a fillable version prepared from the template
2. Enter values in each line exactly as labeled in the template (do not rename lines):
   - Line 1-1: [BASE_AMOUNT from Subtotal Item 1 in Step 1 staging table]
   - Line 1-2: [OPT1_AMOUNT from Additional Item 1 subtotal] or clearly note if not offering (e.g., "$0.00" or "N/A")
   - Line 1-3: [OPT2_AMOUNT from Additional Item 2 subtotal] or N/A
   - Line 1-4: [OPT3_AMOUNT from Additional Item 3 subtotal] or N/A
   - Line 1-5: [OPT4_AMOUNT from Additional Item 4 subtotal] or N/A
   - Line 1-6: [OPT5_AMOUNT from Additional Item 5 subtotal] or N/A
   - Line 1-7: **$20,000.00** (FF&E cash allowance per DEC-012 -- do not leave blank; do not enter any other amount)
   - Tax line: [GST_AMOUNT] calculated as 5% of applicable taxable base
3. Do not alter: the line numbering, field labels, table header ("Contract Price"), title ("Schedule A"), layout, or order of the template
4. Use consistent Canadian dollar formatting with two decimal places throughout (e.g., $1,234,567.00)
5. If the proponent wishes to offer alternatives or value-engineering options per RFP §8.5, list them on a **separate page** appended to Schedule A -- do not enter alternative amounts on the standard pricing lines

**Output:** Completed Schedule A form with all 7 pricing lines and tax line populated

---

### Step 3: Complete the Addenda Acknowledgement Field

**Objective:** Satisfy Hard Constraint C-07 (mandatory; non-compliance may result in price proposal disqualification at Owner's discretion).

**Actions:**

1. Locate the Addenda acknowledgement section on Schedule A (RFP Appendix H, p. 57), which reads verbatim:
   > "The Proponent acknowledges that they have received the following Addenda and have accounted for their contents in their Total Stipulated Price above: Addenda ___ to ___."
2. Complete the field as: **"Addendum 01 to 03"**
   - Addendum 01: July 11, 2024 (bidders meeting date correction; missing dimensions intentional)
   - Addendum 02: July 15, 2024 (missing pages 62-63 is formatting error only; no missing information)
   - Addendum 03: July 31, 2024 (12-acre site; Pickled Sand Storage excluded; FF&E treatment; site servicing allowance; 16 ft doors; sumps; fill stations; solar roof; 40 bunker gear lockers; generator requirements; room sizing ranges)
3. If the form uses discrete fields or checkboxes for each addendum rather than a fill-in-the-blank, mark all three explicitly
4. Do not leave the field blank or partially completed (e.g., only acknowledging Addendum 01)

**Critical pricing check:** Confirm the following addenda pricing impacts are reflected in Schedule B and therefore in Schedule A:

| Addendum 03 Item | Pricing Impact | Check |
|---|---|---|
| §1.2: Pickled Sand Storage building EXCLUDED | No pricing in Schedule A or B for this building | ☐ |
| §1.7: Site servicing as cash allowance | Not in Line 1-1 base; documented in DEL-01-06 | ☐ |
| §1.18: FF&E as Additional Option 6 only | Line 1-7 = $20,000.00; not in Line 1-1 | ☐ |
| §1.8: All bays require sumps | Costs reflected in base building pricing (Schedule B) | ☐ |
| §1.10: 16 ft overhead door height minimum | Costs reflected in base building pricing (Schedule B) | ☐ |
| §1.15: Backup generator required | Costs reflected in base building pricing (Schedule B) | ☐ |

**Output:** Addenda acknowledgement field completed; all pricing reflects addenda requirements

---

### Step 4: Reconcile Schedule A vs. Schedule B

**Objective:** Confirm that every Schedule A line matches its Schedule B source exactly; document the reconciliation as a project record.

**Actions:**

1. Create a reconciliation table:

| Schedule A Line | Schedule A Value | Schedule B Source Line | Schedule B Value | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-1 (Base) | $[entered] | Subtotal Item 1 | $[extracted] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |
| 1-2 (Option 1 -- Wash Bay) | $[entered] | Additional Item 1 subtotal | $[extracted] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |
| 1-3 (Option 2 -- Yard Lighting) | $[entered] | Additional Item 2 subtotal | $[extracted] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |
| 1-4 (Option 3 -- Access Control) | $[entered] | Additional Item 3 subtotal | $[extracted] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |
| 1-5 (Option 4 -- Security + Cameras) | $[entered] | Additional Item 4 subtotal | $[extracted] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |
| 1-6 (Option 5 -- Signage) | $[entered] | Additional Item 5 subtotal | $[extracted] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |
| 1-7 (Option 6 -- Appliances) | $20,000.00 | Additional Item 6 | $20,000.00 | ☐ Y |
| Tax | $[entered] | Calculated (5% GST) | $[calc] | ☐ Y / ☐ N |

2. Resolve any discrepancies: identify which document has the error (Schedule A entry typo vs. Schedule B calculation error) and correct it at the source
3. Verify Grand Total arithmetic: confirm internal arithmetic within Schedule B (Subtotal Base Requirements + Subtotal of Additional Items = TOTAL with Additional Items)
4. Sign-off: Estimator + Finance Lead both sign the reconciliation table confirming 100% match
5. Retain the completed reconciliation table as a project record

**Output:** Signed reconciliation table; Schedule A and Schedule B values confirmed identical

---

### Step 5: Obtain Authorized Signature

**Objective:** Execute Schedule A per RFP §5.2 requirements. Unsigned Schedule A = incomplete submission.

**Actions:**

1. Identify the authorized signatory per proponent legal form:
   - **Corporation:** duly authorized officer; corporate seal affixed in the presence of officers with authority to bind the corporation (§5.2(b))
   - **Individual or Partnership:** signed under seal by the individual or a partner in the presence of a witness; signatory states capacity ("Partner" or "Proprietor") (§5.2(c))
   - **Joint Venture:** each party to the joint venture executes under seal in the manner appropriate to that party (§5.2(d))

2. Confirm signature format requirement: §5.2(a) states signatures "must be in their respective handwriting." Options:
   - **Preferred -- Wet-ink signature:** Print Schedule A; obtain wet-ink signature; scan to PDF at minimum 300 dpi
   - **Electronic signature:** Use a platform that creates an auditable handwriting-equivalent signature trail; retain the audit log; confirm the signature is visually handwritten-style and traceable to the individual

3. **GATE CHECK (X-001):** Before presenting Schedule A for signature, formally verify that Step 4 reconciliation is **complete and signed off** by both Estimator and Finance Lead. Do not proceed to signature execution if the reconciliation table is unsigned or if any line shows a discrepancy. This gate prevents binding the proponent to values that have not been fully reconciled against Schedule B.
   - Confirm reconciliation table from Step 4 is signed by Estimator + Finance Lead
   - Confirm all values are final and reconciled (Step 4 complete -- all lines show "Match = Y")
   - Confirm Line 1-7 = $20,000.00
   - Confirm addenda field reads "Addendum 01 to 03"
   - Confirm tax line is populated

4. Present to signatory for review and execution:
   - Signatory reviews and authorizes the values
   - Signatory enters: Company Name, Print Name and Title, Signature, Date
   - Date must be on or before August 30, 2024 (submission deadline)

5. Retain signed original (paper) or signed electronic file with audit trail

**Output:** Executed Schedule A with authorized handwritten (or equivalent) signature and date

---

### Step 6: Prepare for PDF Integration

**Objective:** Format Schedule A for insertion into the proposal PDF package; confirm file and position compliance.

**Actions:**

1. If Schedule A was signed on paper: scan at minimum 300 dpi (per REQ-SA-16 in Specification); save as searchable PDF; confirm legibility
2. If Schedule A was completed digitally with e-signature: export directly to PDF; confirm signature is visible and legible
3. Confirm the Schedule A PDF page is:
   - Portrait orientation; legible; no blurred or pixelated text
   - All signature fields visible and legible
   - File is clean (no tracking comments, markup, or hidden layers)
4. Name the file clearly for internal tracking: e.g., "AppendixH_ScheduleA_[ProponentName]_[Date].pdf"
5. Insert into the proposal PDF in the correct section position: Section 8 (Proposal Price) per RFP §4.3 / C-02 requirement ("present information in the order of Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9")
6. After full proposal PDF assembly, verify total file size < 15 MB (C-01; RFP §4.2, p. 12)

**Output:** Schedule A integrated into proposal PDF in the Section 8 position; file size verified under 15 MB

| REQ-SA-13 | Authorized signature present; handwritten per §5.2(a); date present; execution form correct for legal structure | Signed | ☐ | |
| REQ-SA-14 | Schedule A in Section 8 position in proposal PDF; total PDF < 15 MB | Confirmed | ☐ | |
| REQ-SA-15 | If alternatives included, they are on a separate page only and do not modify standard pricing lines | N/A or confirmed | ☐ | |
| REQ-SA-16 | If scanned from paper, scan resolution >= 300 dpi; signature, values, and text legible in final PDF | Confirmed (or N/A if digital) | ☐ | |
| REQ-SA-17 | Grand Total arithmetic verified: sum of non-N/A lines + tax = stated total (independent of line-by-line reconciliation) | Verified | ☐ | |
| C-07 | Addenda acknowledgement field complete (non-negotiable -- blank field may disqualify price proposal) | Complete | ☐ | |

**Sign-offs required from:**
- Estimator (cost accuracy and Schedule B reconciliation)
- Finance (reconciliation, tax line, GST confirmation)
- Proposal Compliance Officer (template fidelity, addenda acknowledgement, signature execution)

**Output:** Completed, signed-off compliance checklist; Schedule A approved for submission

## Verification

Summary of post-completion verification checks:

| Check ID | Verification |
|---|---|
| V-001 | Arithmetic: Grand Total = sum of all non-N/A lines + tax. Manual spot-check and calculator verification by Finance. **This check is now also captured as normative requirement REQ-SA-17 in Specification (per lensing item D-001).** |
| V-002 | Reconciliation: Every Schedule A value matches its Schedule B source (signed reconciliation table from Step 4). |
| V-003 | Addenda: Field reads "Addendum 01 to 03"; all three addenda issues confirmed incorporated in pricing. |
| V-004 | FF&E separation: Line 1-7 = $20,000.00; Line 1-1 does not contain FF&E amounts. |
| V-005 | Signature: Authorized, handwritten per §5.2(a), dated, correct execution form for proponent legal structure. |
| V-006 | Template: No modifications to RFP Appendix H layout, line labels, table header, or structure. |
| V-007 | File: Schedule A PDF is legible, correctly oriented; full proposal PDF is under 15 MB; Schedule A is in Section 8 position. |
| V-008 | Addenda pricing: Addendum 03 items §1.2 (no Pickled Sand Storage), §1.7 (site servicing as allowance), §1.18 (FF&E on line 1-7 only) all verified as reflected in pricing. |

If any verification fails, return to the relevant Step, resolve the issue, re-verify, and re-obtain sign-off before submission.

## Notes

### Submission Deadline

- Closing Date: **August 30, 2024 at 2:00:00 PM MST** (email submission to Sean Pendergast, spendergast@townofpenhold.ca)
- Revised proposals permitted up to the closing time; revision number must be clearly indicated
- Proposals received on or after the Closing Date and Time will not be considered

**Source:** RFP §5.3, pp. 13-14

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Blank addenda field:** The most common form-level disqualification risk. Fill it in even if it seems obvious.
2. **FF&E in Line 1-1:** Always double-check that the Schedule B General Requirements subtotal and Public Services Buildings subtotal do not include any appliance/FF&E line item before rolling up to Subtotal Item 1.
3. **Mismatched values:** Ensure Schedule B is finalized BEFORE entering values in Schedule A. Last-minute Schedule B updates that are not carried through to Schedule A create reconciliation failures.
4. **Date on signature block:** Must be on or before August 30, 2024. A future date or a date after the submission deadline creates a compliance question.
5. **Pickled Sand Storage pricing included:** Confirm Schedule B contains no pricing for the Pickled Sand Storage building (excluded per Addendum 03 §1.2 and C-10).
