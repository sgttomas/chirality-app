## Construction

### Schedule A Pricing Line Structure (RFP Appendix H, p. 57)

| Line | RFP Label (verbatim from template) | Pricing Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1-1 | Pricing of Base Requirements: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Public Services Building | TBD (populated by Estimator from Schedule B Subtotal Item 1) |
| 1-2 | Pricing Additional Option 1: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Built in Wash Bay | TBD |
| 1-3 | Pricing Additional Option 2: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Yard Lighting | TBD |
| 1-4 | Pricing Additional Option 3: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Building Access Control | TBD |
| 1-5 | Pricing Additional Option 4: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Security and Camera System | TBD |
| 1-6 | Pricing Additional Option 5: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Signage for Exterior | TBD |
| 1-7 | Pricing Additional Option 6: Design-Builder Base Contract **(Schedule B)** Appliances | $20,000.00 cash allowance (DEC-012) |
| Taxes | GST and any applicable provincial taxes (shown separately) | TBD (5% GST on taxable base -- see Conditions and Conflict Table in Guidance.md C-001) |
| Addenda field | "Addenda ___ to ___" | "Addendum 01 to 03" |

**Note on line 1-7 (Appliances / FF&E):** Addendum 03 §1.18, p. 4 states: "FF&E can be included as an additional item in the proposal but should not be included in the base costs so the evaluation team can accurately evaluate the construction of the building." Per DEC-012 (OI-002 resolution), FF&E is priced as a $20,000 cash allowance on line 1-7 only. This amount must not appear in line 1-1.

**Note on addenda field:** The template reads "Addenda ___ to ___." The correct completion is "Addendum 01 to 03" to acknowledge all three addenda issued: Addendum 01 (July 11, 2024), Addendum 02 (July 15, 2024), Addendum 03 (July 31, 2024). Completion as "Addenda 01 to 03" (plural) also acceptable per template wording.

### Schedule B Source Structure (RFP Appendix H, p. 59)

Schedule B feeds Schedule A. The base requirement line in Schedule A (line 1-1) is the aggregate of three Schedule B base items:

| Schedule B Component | Feeds |
|---|---|
| General Requirements (Design and Engineering, Bonding, etc.) | Subtotal Item 1 → Schedule A line 1-1 |
| Public Services Buildings | Subtotal Item 1 → Schedule A line 1-1 |
| Public Services Sitework | Subtotal Item 1 → Schedule A line 1-1 |
| Additional Item 1 -- Built in Wash Bay (Interior Structure + Pressure Washing Equipment) | Schedule A line 1-2 |
| Additional Item 2 -- Yard Lighting (Yard Lighting including Install) | Schedule A line 1-3 |
| Additional Item 3 -- Access Control (Access Control throughout Building) | Schedule A line 1-4 |
| Additional Item 4 -- Security and Camera System (Security + Monthly Monitoring Fee) | Schedule A line 1-5 |
| Additional Item 5 -- Signage (Town of Penhold Operations + Fire Department Signs) | Schedule A line 1-6 |
| Additional Item 6 -- Appliances (Appliances for Public Services Building) | Schedule A line 1-7 |

**Note:** Schedule B includes "Subtotal Base Requirements," "Subtotal of Additional Items," "TOTAL with Additional Items," and "TOTAL without Additional Items" aggregate lines. These do not have direct line equivalents in Schedule A but are internal Schedule B integrity checks.

### Signature and Execution Block (RFP Appendix H, p. 58)

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Company Name | [Proponent legal name] |
| Print Name and Title | [Authorized signatory name and title] |
| Signature of Proponent | [Handwritten signature per §5.2(a)] |
| Date | [Date on or before August 30, 2024 deadline] |

**Execution requirements per RFP §5.2, pp. 13-14:**
- (a) Signature(s) must be in the respective signatory's handwriting
- (b) Corporation: executed under corporate seal, affixed in presence of officers with authority to bind the corporation
- (c) Individual or partnership: executed under seal in presence of witness; capacity stated ("Partner" or "Proprietor")
- (d) Joint venture: each party executes under seal in the appropriate manner

**Note:** §5.2 states: "Failure to provide an authorized signature will result in the response being deemed incomplete."

### Method of Payment (RFP Appendix H, p. 58)

Monthly progress draws following receipt and acceptance of:
1. Schedule of values (broken out by trade)
2. Cash flow update
3. Invoice by the Project Authority

Invoice must detail each major task and each approved change in a table with columns for: previous progress, progress this period, progress to the date, holdback, and total task amount.
