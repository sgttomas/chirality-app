## Construction

### 4a. PDF Assembly

**Approach:** ASSUMPTION — standard PDF assembly workflow:
1. Finalize all proposal content sections in native format (Word, InDesign, CAD exports)
2. Convert each section to PDF with embedded fonts
3. Embed all required drawings (site plan, architectural concept, elevations, sections per §7.1.1)
4. Create PDF bookmarks/outline matching RFP Sections 6–9 and Appendices
5. Concatenate into single PDF with continuous page numbering
6. Add document properties (title, author, subject) for searchability
7. Validate file size (≤15 MB); if exceeded, reduce image resolution or compress non-critical content

**Quality checks:**
- File opens cleanly on standard PDF readers (Adobe Reader, Preview)
- All pages print legibly; drawings readable at 100% zoom
- Bookmarks navigate correctly to RFP sections
- Page numbering continuous; no gaps

### 4b. Appendix G — Letter of Offer

**Template location:** RFP p.56 (Section 12.12 APPENDIX G: Letter of Offer)

**Addressee block** (Source: Appendix G, RFP p.56):
> Sean Pendergast, Town of Penhold Box 10, 1 Waskasoo Ave Penhold, Alberta T0M 1R0

**RE line:** Letter of Offer — Penhold Public Services Building

**Proponent declaration in template body:**
- "We submit herewith a Proposal in response to the referenced RFP, and hereby offer to provide the goods and services as indicated in the RFP in consideration of payment by the Town of Penhold."
- "We have carefully examined the RFP documents and have a clear understanding of the requirements of the RFP and the RFP Process."
- "We acknowledge that the Town of Penhold may disqualify the Proposal of any Proponent where the Proponent fails to provide information or makes misrepresentations regarding any of the information included in the Letter of Offer."

**Signature block fields** (Source: Appendix G, RFP p.56):
- Header: "SIGNED (I have authority to bind the Proponent)"
- Company Name (line)
- Print Name and Title (line)
- Signature of Proponent (line) + Date (line, right side)

**Execution requirements** (Source: RFP §5.2):
- §5.2(a): Signature(s) in respective handwriting (all entity types)
- §5.2(b): Corporation — executed under corporate seal, in presence of officers with authority to bind
- §5.2(c): Individual or partnership — executed under seal by individual/partner in presence of witness; capacity stated (e.g., "Partner" or "Proprietor")
- §5.2(d): Joint venture — each party executes under seal in manner appropriate to that party

**Consequence of non-execution:** "Failure to provide an authorized signature will result in the response being deemed incomplete." (RFP §5.2)

### 4c. Appendix H — Addenda Acknowledgement in Schedule A

**Template location:** RFP p.57 (Schedule A)

**Actual template language** (Source: Appendix H, RFP p.57):
> "The Proponent acknowledges that they have received the following Addenda and have accounted for their contents in their Total Stipulated Price above: Addenda \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

**Warning language in template:** "Failure to acknowledge receipt and inclusion of all addenda may result in this Price Proposal being disqualified, at the discretion of the Owner."

**Required completion:** Fill in range "Addendum 01 to Addendum 03" (three addenda issued). ASSUMPTION: range format; confirm final count matches total addenda issued at closing.

**Schedule A also requires Proponent signature** (Source: Appendix H, p.58): Same four fields as Appendix G — Company Name, Print Name and Title, Signature of Proponent, Date.

### 4d. Appendix H — Schedule B Cost Breakdown

**Template location:** RFP p.59 (Schedule B)

**Line items to complete** (Source: Appendix H Schedule B, RFP p.59):
- General Requirements (Design and Engineering, Bonding etc.) — bond costs captured here
- Public Services Buildings
- Public Services Sitework
- Subtotal Item 1 (feeds Schedule A row 1-1)
- Additional Items 1–6 (Wash Bay, Yard Lighting, Access Control, Security/Camera, Signage, Appliances)
- Subtotal Base Requirements / Subtotal Additional Items / TOTAL with/without Additional Items

**Bond cost note:** "Bonding" is explicitly listed in the "General Requirements" line description — confirms bond premium is embedded in Schedule B row 1 (General Requirements) (Source: Appendix H Schedule B, RFP p.59).

### 4e. Revision Control (if resubmitted before deadline)

**Tracking method** (Source: RFP §5.3):
- Revised proposals permitted up to closing date and time
- "The address on the submission must clearly indicate the revision number of the submission"
- Revision log to be maintained: revision number, date/time submitted, sections changed, authorized by
