## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Content Files for PDF Assembly

**Duration:** 1–2 hours | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + Content Lead

**Actions:**

1.1. Collect all finalized content sections from project repository in assembly order:
   - Section 6: Mandatory Requirements (Appendix G to be signed in Step 5)
   - Section 7: Project Delivery Plan and Design Brief (all discipline content)
   - Section 8: Financial Proposal (Appendix H: Schedule A with addenda range + Schedule B; addenda range to be completed in Step 6)
   - Section 9: Team Qualifications (Appendix I — Design-Build Team / Subtrade List)
   - Appendix A: Owner Statement of Requirements (provided by Owner; include as received)
   - Appendix B: Functional Program (provided by Owner; include as received)
   - Appendix G: Letter of Offer template (to be signed in Step 5)
   - Appendix H: Schedule A + Schedule B (range field and signatures in Steps 6 and 7)
   - Appendix I: Design-Build Team List
   - Appendix J: Supplementary Conditions (Owner-provided; include as received)
   - Agreement to Bond (from DEL-01-03 — confirm document received and legible)
   - All drawings: site plan, architectural concept, elevations, sections (per §7.1.1)

1.2. Convert each section to PDF if not already in PDF format:
   - Use native PDF export (Word → PDF, InDesign → PDF, AutoCAD → PDF)
   - Embed fonts to prevent substitution on Owner's system
   - Confirm standard page sizes (8.5"×11" for text; 11"×17" for large drawings)

1.3. Verify content integrity in each converted PDF:
   - Open and spot-check 10% of pages for legibility and formatting preservation
   - Confirm no placeholder text remains (e.g., "[INSERT FIGURE]", "[TBD]")
   - Verify page numbers are present where applicable

1.4. Establish file naming for assembly order:
   - Use sequential prefixes: `01_Sec6_LetterOfOffer.pdf`, `02_Sec7a_DesignMethodology.pdf`, etc.
   - Sort numerically to enforce assembly order

1.5. Log all content files in assembly checklist (file name, version, size, date converted, checked-by).

**Success Criteria:** All content sections available as PDF; file list sorted in assembly order; 10% spot-check confirms legibility.

---

### Step 2: Create PDF Bookmark Structure

**Duration:** 1–2 hours | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + Technical Designer

**Actions:**

2.1. Define bookmark hierarchy matching RFP section order (Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 verbatim headings):

```
Penhold PSB Proposal — [Company Name]
├─ Section 6: Mandatory Requirements
│  └─ Appendix G: Letter of Offer
├─ Section 7: Project Delivery Plan
│  ├─ 7.1: Design Methodology
│  │  ├─ 7.1.1: Proposed Conceptual Design
│  │  ├─ 7.1.2: Design Brief
│  │  └─ [subsections as applicable]
│  ├─ 7.2: Construction Methodology
│  └─ 7.3: Construction Phase and Administration
├─ Section 8: Financial Proposal
│  ├─ Appendix H Schedule A: Pricing Summary
│  └─ Appendix H Schedule B: Cost Breakdown
├─ Section 9: Team Qualifications
│  └─ Appendix I: Design-Build Team List
├─ Appendix A: Owner Statement of Requirements
├─ Appendix B: Functional Program
├─ Appendix J: Supplementary Conditions
└─ Agreement to Bond
```

2.2. Test bookmark structure on sample assembled PDF:
   - Click each bookmark; verify navigation to correct section/page
   - Test on both Adobe Reader and Preview

2.3. Document final bookmark hierarchy in assembly log.

**Success Criteria:** Bookmark outline matches RFP section headings verbatim; all bookmarks functional; no broken links.

---

### Step 3: Assemble Draft Single PDF File

**Duration:** 1–2 hours | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + PDF Specialist

**Actions:**

3.1. Concatenate all content PDFs in assembly order using selected PDF tool (Appendix G and Schedule A/B are unsigned at this stage — signed versions inserted in Step 7).

3.2. Apply continuous page numbering to footer of all pages (format: "Page X of Y"); exclude cover page or number as Page 0 if used.

3.3. Embed bookmark structure from Step 2; re-test bookmark navigation post-assembly.

3.4. Add document metadata:
   - Title: "Penhold PSB Proposal — [Company Name]"
   - Author: [Company Name]
   - Subject: "Response to RFP 2024_004 — Public Services Building"

3.5. Save draft PDF with version naming: `Penhold_PSB_Proposal_[CompanyName]_DRAFT_[YYYYMMDD].pdf`

**Success Criteria:** Single draft PDF created; all pages present in correct order; page numbering continuous; bookmarks functional; file opens cleanly.

---

### Step 4: Validate File Size and Optimize if Needed

**Duration:** 1–3 hours (depending on optimization required) | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + PDF Specialist

**Actions:**

4.1. Measure file size:
   - If ≤ 15 MB (15,728,640 bytes): proceed to Step 5.
   - If > 15 MB: execute optimization steps 4.2–4.4.

4.2. Reduce image resolution:
   - Compress photographs/diagrams to 250 dpi (lossy acceptable for on-screen evaluation)
   - Retain technical drawings at 300–600 dpi minimum
   - Use PDF optimization (Adobe Acrobat "Reduce File Size" or Ghostscript `-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook`)

4.3. If still > 15 MB, remove non-essential content:
   - Remove secondary graphics (renders, 3D views not required by RFP §7.1.1)
   - Summarize large appendices (geotechnical report, wetland assessment, site grading) — replace with 2-page summary; note full document available on request
   - Verify all removed content is non-mandatory per RFP

4.4. Re-test file size after each optimization round; repeat until ≤ 15 MB.

4.5. Verify content legibility after optimization:
   - Open optimized PDF; zoom to 100%, 150%, 200% on key pages
   - Confirm drawings readable and text selectable
   - If legibility degraded, revert step and try alternative compression

4.6. Log optimization steps (original size, steps taken, final size, legibility confirmed).

**Success Criteria:** Draft PDF file size ≤ 15 MB (headroom for signed pages to be added in Step 7); all RFP-required content retained; content legible at standard zoom levels.

---

### Step 5: Execute Appendix G (Letter of Offer)

**Duration:** 30–60 minutes | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + Authorized Signatory

**Actions:**

5.1. Print Appendix G from draft PDF (physical signature required per RFP §5.2(a) — handwriting mandate).

5.2. Verify all fields are pre-populated before presenting to signatory:
   - Addressee block: Sean Pendergast, Town of Penhold Box 10, 1 Waskasoo Ave Penhold, Alberta T0M 1R0
   - RE line: "Letter of Offer — Penhold Public Services Building"
   - All body text paragraphs intact and unaltered
   *(Source: Appendix G template, RFP p.56)*

5.3. Signatory reads Appendix G in full and executes:
   - **Company Name** line: print/type company legal name
   - **Print Name and Title** line: signatory prints their full name and title
   - **Signature of Proponent** line: handwritten signature (blue or black ink)
   - **Date** line (right side): date of signing (August 30, 2024 or earlier; no forward-dating)
   - Header statement "SIGNED (I have authority to bind the Proponent)" is pre-printed — confirm it is present and unaltered

5.4. Apply execution requirement per entity type (Source: RFP §5.2):
   - **Corporation (§5.2(b)):** Corporate seal affixed in presence of officer(s) with authority to bind; seal impression legible; confirm seal matches corporate records
   - **Individual or Partnership (§5.2(c)):** Seal affixed by individual/partner; witness present; witness prints name, title, and signs witness line; signatory shows capacity ("Partner" or "Proprietor") in Print Name and Title field
   - **Joint Venture (§5.2(d)):** Each JV party executes separately under seal in their applicable manner; all party seals and signatures present

5.5. Photograph signed and sealed Appendix G as backup record.

5.6. Scan signed Appendix G at 300 dpi, color, letter-size:
   - Save as `Appendix_G_Signed_[SignatoryName]_[YYYYMMDD].pdf`
   - Verify scan is legible (signature, print name, date, and seal clearly visible)

**Success Criteria:** Appendix G signed, dated, and sealed (if applicable); scanned PDF legible; all four fields completed; body text unaltered.

---

### Step 6: Complete Schedule A — Addenda Range Field and Proponent Signature

**Duration:** 30–60 minutes | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + Pricing Lead / Authorized Signatory

**Actions:**

6.1. Open Appendix H Schedule A template (RFP p.57–58).

6.2. Locate the addenda acknowledgement range field (Source: Appendix H, RFP p.57):
   > "The Proponent acknowledges that they have received the following Addenda and have accounted for their contents in their Total Stipulated Price above: Addenda \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

6.3. Complete the range field:
   - Fill in: "Addendum 01 to Addendum 03"
   - ASSUMPTION: Three addenda issued at closing (01 = Jul 11; 02 = Jul 15; 03 = Jul 31). Verify on August 30 that no Addendum 04 was issued; if issued, update range accordingly.

6.4. Confirm all Schedule A pricing rows (1-1 through 1-7) are complete and reconcile with Schedule B totals.

6.5. Complete Schedule A Proponent signature block (Source: Appendix H, RFP p.58) — same fields as Appendix G:
   - **Company Name** line
   - **Print Name and Title** line
   - **Signature of Proponent** line (handwritten)
   - **Date** line (contemporaneous; August 30, 2024 or earlier)
   *(Note: This is a separate signature event from Appendix G. Authority rules in §5.2 apply equally.)*

6.6. Photograph and scan completed Schedule A at 300 dpi, color:
   - Save as `Appendix_H_ScheduleA_Final_[YYYYMMDD].pdf`
   - Verify addenda range field, all pricing rows, and Proponent signature block are legible in scan

6.7. Confirm Schedule B is complete in full:
   - All line items have dollar values (no blanks — enter "$0" for zero-cost items)
   - Bond premium confirmed in "General Requirements (Design and Engineering, Bonding etc.)" line
   - Subtotals and totals computed
   - Schedule B does not require a separate Proponent signature

**Success Criteria:** Schedule A addenda range field completed; all pricing rows complete; Proponent signature block executed; Schedule B complete in full with bond premium in General Requirements line.

---

### Step 7: Re-Assemble Final PDF with Signed Appendices

**Duration:** 1–2 hours | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + PDF Specialist

**Actions:**

7.1. Replace unsigned Appendix G in draft PDF with scanned signed version from Step 5.

7.2. Replace unsigned Appendix H Schedule A with signed/completed version from Step 6.

7.3. Verify Agreement to Bond document (from DEL-01-03) is present in the assembled PDF:
   - Locate via bookmark or text search
   - Confirm document is legible
   - Confirm bond split (Performance Bond 50% + Labour and Material Payment Bond 50%) is stated

7.4. Re-verify page numbering and bookmarks are intact after replacements:
   - No gaps in page numbering
   - All bookmarks still navigate correctly

7.5. Re-test file size; apply optimization from Step 4 if scanned pages added size. Target: ≤ 15 MB.

7.6. Save final PDF:
   - File name: `Penhold_PSB_Proposal_[CompanyName]_FINAL_[YYYYMMDD].pdf`

7.7. Perform final spot-check (minimum):
   - Appendix G: signature, print name, title, date, and seal (if applicable) all visible
   - Schedule A: addenda range field complete ("Addendum 01 to Addendum 03"); Proponent signature block complete
   - Schedule B: all lines have values; bond in General Requirements line
   - Agreement to Bond present
   - Spot-check 5 random pages for formatting, order, legibility

**Success Criteria:** Final PDF contains signed Appendix G, signed Schedule A with addenda range, complete Schedule B, and Agreement to Bond; page numbering continuous; bookmarks functional; file size ≤ 15 MB.

---

### Step 8: Final Compliance Check Against DEL-01-01

**Duration:** 1 hour | **Owner:** Proposal Manager + Compliance Lead

**Timing Constraint:** Step 8 must be completed **no later than 2 hours before the submission time** targeted in Step 10 (i.e., if submission is planned for 12:00 MST, Step 8 must be complete by 10:00 MST). This ensures sufficient time to address any compliance findings before the 14:00 MST hard deadline. The 48-hour content freeze (Pre-Condition 1) covers content changes; this timing constraint covers the final compliance inspection-to-submission gap. **ASSUMPTION:** 2-hour buffer is sufficient for addressing minor compliance findings; major findings detected at this stage would require escalation per the Escalation table. [Enrichment: D-001]

**Actions:**

8.1. Retrieve DEL-01-01 (Compliance Matrix & Checklist) — final signed-off version.

8.2. Verify all mandatory items are satisfied in the assembled PDF:
   - [ ] Single PDF file
   - [ ] File size ≤ 15 MB
   - [ ] Content in RFP order (Sections 6, 7, 8, 9)
   - [ ] Main section headings match RFP verbatim
   - [ ] All required drawings (§7.1.1) embedded and legible
   - [ ] Appendix G: all four fields + declaration present; signed, sealed (if applicable), dated
   - [ ] Schedule A: addenda range filled ("Addendum 01 to Addendum 03"); Proponent signature block complete
   - [ ] Schedule B: all lines complete; bond premium in General Requirements
   - [ ] Agreement to Bond present (produced by DEL-01-03)
   - [ ] All addenda integrated in applicable content sections
   - [ ] Intent to Propose (Appendix C) status: not submitted per DEC-010 — confirmed
   - [ ] Submission email address verified: spendergast@townofpenhold.ca

8.3. Document compliance sign-off: Proposal Manager + Project Manager or Compliance Lead sign off.

8.4. Escalate any unresolved red items to executive sponsor before submission.

**Success Criteria:** All mandatory checklist items green or red items explicitly accepted and documented; sign-off obtained from Proposal Manager.
