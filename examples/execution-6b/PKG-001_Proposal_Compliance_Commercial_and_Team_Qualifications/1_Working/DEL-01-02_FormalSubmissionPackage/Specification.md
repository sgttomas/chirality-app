## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| CONF-01 | Bond documentation scope boundary: Specification R5 assigns verification of Agreement to Bond presence and content to DEL-01-02 assembly role, while decomposition assigns production of Agreement to Bond to DEL-01-03 (SOW-0004). Risk: DEL-01-02 must rely on DEL-01-03 completing the document before assembly can be finalized. | Specification R5-01–R5-04 | Decomposition v2.3 §9 (DEL-01-03, SOW-0004) | R5-01–R5-04; Datasheet Conditions; Procedure Prerequisites | DEL-01-03 produces the Agreement to Bond. DEL-01-02's R5 responsibilities are limited to inclusion in the PDF and high-level verification that the document is present and legible. Detailed content verification (surety authorization, CCDC conformance) is DEL-01-03's responsibility. | TBD |
