# DEL-01-02: Formal Submission Package — Guidance

## Purpose

The Formal Submission Package (DEL-01-02) ensures that the Town of Penhold receives a compliant, properly executed Design-Build proposal that satisfies all mandatory formal submission requirements and avoids disqualification risk.

**Why this matters:**
- The RFP includes a **pass/fail formal compliance gate** (OBJ-001). A single error in submission format, execution, or addenda acknowledgement can disqualify the entire proposal regardless of technical merit.
- DEL-01-02 is the final quality control checkpoint before delivery to the Owner.
- Failure here means no evaluation of PKG-002 through PKG-010 content — zero technical or price points available.

---

## Principles

### P-001: Compliance as the Foundation

A well-designed proposal with competitive pricing offers zero value if it fails the formal submission gate. Compliance is the prerequisite for evaluation.

**Application:**
- Every requirement in RFP §4.1–§4.3, §5.1–§5.3.1, and §6.1 is treated as a hard constraint, not a guideline.
- All three addenda are acknowledged in Schedule A by name (Addendum 01 to Addendum 03 in the range field); generic or vague language is insufficient.
- The Proposal Manager is the final authority on formal submission compliance and may not delegate the final sign-off.

**Source:** RFP §2.5 (disqualification at Owner's sole discretion if proposal deemed incomplete); §5.1 (failure to comply may result in rejection); §6.1 (mandatory requirement)

### P-002: File Size as a Feasibility Constraint

The 15 MB limit reflects the Owner's email system and evaluation team device capabilities. It is a hard constraint with no stated exception path.

**Application:**
- Drawings are compressed without loss of legibility (300 dpi minimum for technical drawings; 250 dpi for photographs/diagrams is acceptable for on-screen evaluation).
- Redundant content is eliminated (no duplicate draft and final versions of the same section).
- If file size exceeds 15 MB, reduce content before reducing quality; omit lower-priority supporting graphics before degrading drawing resolution.

**Source:** RFP §4.2 ("PDF format (under 15 MB in size)")

### P-003: Content Ordering as Courtesy to Evaluators

The RFP specifies section order (6, 7, 8, 9) and main headings so evaluators can navigate and score efficiently. The rationale is stated explicitly: to ensure "each Proposal receives full consideration."

**Application:**
- PDF bookmarks exactly mirror RFP section structure.
- Main heading text matches RFP verbatim; do not paraphrase.
- Evaluators use the bookmark panel to jump between sections; unclear naming causes scoring friction and may disadvantage the proposal.

**Source:** RFP §4.3 ("presents the information in the order provided in Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 to ensure that each Proposal receives full consideration")

> **Terminology note (cross-document normalization):** The content ordering requirement is expressed with minor wording variations across the four documents: Datasheet says "RFP Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 in order; main headings preserved verbatim"; Specification R2-01 says "RFP section order: Sections 6, 7, 8, 9"; Procedure Step 2.1 says "Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 verbatim headings"; and this Guidance principle says "section order (6, 7, 8, 9)." All convey the same meaning. The **canonical phrasing** from the RFP source is: "presents the information in the order provided in Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9" (RFP §4.3). Minor phrasing differences are not substantive but implementors should refer to RFP §4.3 as the authoritative statement. [Enrichment: F-002]

### P-004: Execution as Proof of Authority

Signature and seal are legal evidence that the Proponent's authorized representative has reviewed and committed to the proposal terms. The Appendix G header states this explicitly: "SIGNED (I have authority to bind the Proponent)."

**Application:**
- Signatory must have explicit authority to bind the company (typically President, CEO, or Managing Partner — confirmed by legal resolution or corporate bylaws on file).
- Corporate seal (for corporations per §5.2(b)) must be affixed; the impression is the company's official mark.
- Date must be contemporaneous — not forward-dated or backdated.
- If the company is a joint venture, all parties must execute separately under seal.
- Note: Appendix H Schedule A also carries its own signature block (Company Name, Print Name and Title, Signature, Date) — two signature events are required (Appendix G and Schedule A).

**Source:** RFP §5.2; Appendix G (p.56); Appendix H (p.58)

### P-005: Addenda Acknowledgement as a Fill-In-the-Blank Field — Know the Format

The Schedule A addenda acknowledgement is a **range fill-in field**, not a checklist. The template reads: "The Proponent acknowledges that they have received the following Addenda and have accounted for their contents in their Total Stipulated Price above: Addenda \_\_ to \_\_."

**Application:**
- Complete the range as: "Addendum 01 to Addendum 03" (three addenda issued as of RFP closing).
- ASSUMPTION: No further addenda are issued between Addendum 03 (Jul 31) and the August 30 closing. Verify the final count on the day of submission; update the range field if a fourth addendum is issued.
- The template includes an explicit disqualification warning: "Failure to acknowledge receipt and inclusion of all addenda may result in this Price Proposal being disqualified, at the discretion of the Owner."

**Source:** RFP Appendix H (p.57); RFP §2.9

### P-006: Addenda Integration is Content-Level, Not Just Acknowledgement-Level

Signing the acknowledgement field is necessary but not sufficient. The addenda must also be embedded in the substantive content sections.

**Application:**
- Addendum 01 (Jul 11, 2024): Bidders meeting date corrected to July 25; missing functional program dimensions are intentional (designer proposes). Integrated where meeting attendance or program dimensions are referenced.
- Addendum 02 (Jul 15, 2024): Missing pages 62–63 is a formatting/numbering error; no missing information. No speculation on missing content.
- Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024): **Critical.** Defines 12-acre developable site, removes pickled sand storage, specifies program clarifications (bay sumps, 16 ft overhead doors, 40 bunker gear lockers with ventilated storage, 2" water fill stations, solar-ready roof rough-ins, generator essential loads, FF&E as $20K cash allowance, site servicing cash allowance, survey files post-award). All must be embedded in applicable content sections (PKG-002 through PKG-005); failure to acknowledge in Schedule A is a compliance failure.

**Source:** RFP §2.9; Addenda 01–03

### P-007: Revision Control as Risk Mitigation

If resubmission is necessary, a clear revision trail protects both Proponent and Owner.

**Application:**
- Each revision has a unique sequential number (Revision 01, 02, etc.); initial submission = Revision 00.
- Revision log includes date, time (MST), sections changed, and authorized by.
- Subject line and file name include revision number.
- The RFP requires the "address on the submission must clearly indicate the revision number" — this applies to both file name and email subject line.
- Do not delete or overwrite previous revisions; maintain full audit trail.

**Source:** RFP §5.3 ("the address on the submission must clearly indicate the revision number of the submission")

## Considerations

### C-001: Timing of PDF Assembly

PDF assembly should begin only after all upstream content sections are finalized and frozen.

**Rationale:** Last-minute content changes cascade through the assembled PDF (changed page counts break bookmarks, page numbering errors occur). Multiple re-assembly cycles introduce error and consume time.

**Mitigation:** Schedule a "content freeze" 48 hours before the deadline. After freeze, only compliance-driven corrections (identified by DEL-01-01) are permitted. Final signed Appendix G and Schedule A are inserted in a separate re-assembly step (Step 7 of Procedure).

### C-002: Two Signature Events Required

Both Appendix G and Appendix H Schedule A require Proponent signatures. These are separate documents with separate signature blocks. The same four fields appear in both: Company Name, Print Name and Title, Signature of Proponent, Date.

**Rationale:** Teams focused on Appendix G may overlook the Schedule A signature requirement (p.58). Missing either signature is a compliance gap.

**Mitigation:** Include both signature events as explicit checklist items in DEL-01-01. Assign a single authorized signatory to both (or two authorized signatories if the pricing authority differs from the corporate officer). Confirm availability of both before the content freeze.

**Source:** RFP §5.2; Appendix G (p.56); Appendix H (p.58)

### C-003: Addenda Acknowledgement in Schedule A is a Compliance Trap

The acknowledgement range field in Schedule A is easy to overlook because it is a compliance field embedded in a pricing template.

**Rationale:** Pricing teams focus on numbers; compliance fields go unnoticed. Per RFP Appendix H (p.57), failure to acknowledge may result in the Price Proposal being disqualified at the Owner's discretion.

**Mitigation:** Add an explicit instruction flag at the addenda line in the Schedule A working template. Include a specific checklist item in DEL-01-01: "Schedule A addenda range field completed — Addendum 01 to Addendum 03." Proposal Manager reviews Schedule A 72 hours before deadline.

### C-004: Schedule B Must Be Complete in Full

Schedule B includes all cost line items; partial completion may result in disqualification.

**Rationale:** RFP Appendix H (p.59) states: "Failure to complete this section in its entirety may result in disqualification of the Proposal, as the sole discretion of the Owner." Bond costs are embedded in the first line item ("General Requirements (Design and Engineering, Bonding etc.)").

**Mitigation:** Estimating team completes all lines; zero-value lines **shall** carry "$0" and not be left blank. The RFP states "Failure to complete this section in its entirety may result in disqualification" (Appendix H, p.59) — a blank line could be interpreted as incomplete rather than zero-cost. Bond premium from DEL-01-03 is needed before Schedule B can be finalized — confirm handoff timing. **ASSUMPTION:** "$0" is the acceptable notation for zero-value lines; confirm with Owner if "N/A" or "Included" is also acceptable for items bundled elsewhere. [Enrichment: A-002]

> **Note (Specification alignment):** Consider whether Specification R4-05 acceptance criteria should explicitly require "$0" for zero-value lines rather than relying solely on Guidance language. Currently, R4-05 states "All line items... have values entered" which is ambiguous on whether a blank constitutes "no value." [Enrichment: A-002]

**Source:** RFP Appendix H (p.59)

### C-005: File Size Optimization Triage

If the initial PDF assembly exceeds 15 MB, apply the following triage sequence before escalating:

1. Reduce photograph/diagram resolution to 250 dpi (acceptable for on-screen evaluation).
2. Remove secondary graphics (render images, 3D models not required by RFP §7.1.1).
3. Summarize large appendices (geotechnical report, wetland assessment, site grading) — replace with 2-page summary referencing full documents available on request.
4. Apply PDF compression (Adobe Acrobat Optimize, Ghostscript `-dPDFSETTINGS=/screen`).
5. **Last resort only:** If PDF still exceeds 15 MB after all the above, consider requesting Owner approval for two-part submission. Do not split without explicit Owner consent.

**Source for large appendices:** RFP §2.3 (Appendices D, E, F — geotechnical, site grading, site plan)

### C-005a: DPI Threshold Rationale

The DPI thresholds in P-002 (300 dpi minimum for technical drawings; 250 dpi for photographs/diagrams) are based on the following reasoning:

**300 dpi for technical drawings:** At 100% zoom on a standard monitor (~96 dpi native), 300 dpi source material preserves fine line weights, dimension text, and hatching patterns typical of site plans, elevations, and sections. RFP §4.2 requires drawings to be "embedded in PDF" and R1-03 acceptance criteria requires legibility "at 100% zoom." Below 300 dpi, thin lines (e.g., 0.25 pt pen weight) may drop out or alias, failing the legibility check.

**250 dpi for photographs/diagrams:** Photographs and diagrams contain continuous-tone imagery rather than fine lines. 250 dpi is sufficient for on-screen evaluation at 100% zoom and provides acceptable print quality on 8.5"x11" output. This lower threshold creates file size savings that help meet the 15 MB constraint (P-002).

**ASSUMPTION:** These thresholds are based on standard digital document practices for proposal submissions and the constraints of the 15 MB file size limit (RFP §4.2). The RFP does not specify minimum DPI values. If the Owner's evaluation process involves large-format printing of drawings, higher DPI may be warranted. [Enrichment: D-002]

**Source:** RFP §4.2 (file size constraint); R1-03 (legibility at 100% zoom); industry practice for digital proposal submissions

### C-006: Email Submission Confirmation

Email systems can fail silently (bounce, spam filtering, server timeout).

**Mitigation:** Submit at least 2 hours before deadline (target 10:00–12:00 MST). Enable delivery receipt and read receipt. If no auto-confirmation within 1 hour, call Sean Pendergast (spendergast@townofpenhold.ca / 1 Waskasoo Ave, Penhold) to verbally confirm receipt. Log the confirmation date, time, and name of person confirming. Screenshot the sent email and confirmation for the submission record.

**Source:** RFP §5.3

### C-007: Bond Document Scope Boundary

The Agreement to Bond is produced by DEL-01-03, not DEL-01-02. DEL-01-02's responsibility is to integrate the completed bond document into the assembled PDF and verify it is present before submission.

**Rationale:** SOW-0004 (Agreement to Bond) is explicitly assigned to DEL-01-03 in the decomposition. Maintaining this boundary prevents duplication of effort and ensures the surety engagement is managed by the Commercial Lead (DEL-01-03 owner), not the assembly function (DEL-01-02 owner). See also CONF-01 in the Conflict Table.

**Source:** Decomposition v2.3 §9 (DEL-01-03 entry); SOW-0004

### C-007a: Records Retention Period Rationale

Procedure Records Retention table specifies 2-year retention for most submission records and 7-year retention for signed originals (Appendix G, Schedule A). The basis for these periods:

**2-year retention (submission records, revision log, email confirmations):** **ASSUMPTION** -- this period is based on a typical project completion-plus-warranty cycle. Design-Build projects under CCDC 14-2013 typically carry a 1-year warranty period (GC 12.2); 2 years post-completion provides margin for latent defect claims. The RFP does not specify a records retention requirement for submission documentation.

**7-year retention (signed originals):** **ASSUMPTION** -- this period aligns with the Alberta Limitations Act general limitation period of 2 years plus the ultimate limitation period of 10 years (RSA 2000, c. L-12). A 7-year retention from project completion provides coverage for most contractual and tort claims. Corporate records policies may also mandate longer retention for executed contracts.

**Note:** If the Proponent's corporate records policy or insurance requirements mandate different retention periods, the longer period governs. Confirm with Legal and Finance. [Enrichment: X-003]

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Content Depth vs. File Size

**Trade-off:** Include detailed supporting graphics (renders, process flow diagrams, engineering details) OR stay under 15 MB.

**Guidance:** Prioritize RFP-mandated drawings (site plan, building massing, floor plans, elevations, key sections per RFP §7.1.1). Supporting graphics are valuable but secondary. If file size is constrained, cut supporting graphics first; retain core RFP-mandated drawings last.

### T-002: Presentation Quality vs. Assembly Speed

**Trade-off:** High-fidelity professional layout takes time. Assembly window is constrained (48–72 hours before deadline).

**Guidance:** Establish a minimum visual standard early (professional fonts, consistent headings, clear section breaks) achievable within the timeline. Do not sacrifice compliance (signatures, addenda acknowledgement, section ordering) for visual polish. A plain but compliant proposal passes the gate; a beautiful but noncompliant one does not.

### T-003: Single PDF vs. Multiple Files

**Trade-off:** RFP requires a single PDF (R1-01). Splitting into multiple files may simplify assembly logistics but violates the requirement.

**Guidance:** Honor the single-PDF constraint unconditionally. If assembly is technically challenging, invest in PDF creation tools (Adobe Acrobat, Ghostscript) rather than circumventing the requirement. Multiple files = rejection risk.

### T-004: Single Signatory vs. Dual Signatories for Appendix G and Schedule A

**Trade-off:** Using the same authorized officer to sign both Appendix G and Schedule A simplifies authority management. Using separate signatories (e.g., CFO for Schedule A, President for Appendix G) may better reflect actual authority delegation.

**Guidance:** If a single officer has full binding authority, one signatory is cleaner and reduces coordination risk. If the pricing lead and corporate officer are different individuals, obtain two separate signatures — both signature blocks require the same "I have authority to bind the Proponent" declaration. Confirm legal advice before deciding.

## Examples

### EX-001: Successful Formal Submission

**Scenario:** Company ABC submits proposal on August 30, 2024, 11:30 AM MST (2.5 hours before deadline).

**Steps:**
1. All content sections finalized by August 29, EOD. Content freeze in effect.
2. PDF assembled and tested August 29, 16:00; file size = 14.8 MB (within limit).
3. Appendix G printed from draft PDF; signed by President ("SIGNED — I have authority to bind the Proponent"); corporate seal affixed; dated August 30.
4. Schedule A addenda range field completed: "Addendum 01 to Addendum 03"; Schedule A signed by CFO; scanned and re-inserted.
5. PDF re-assembled with signed Appendix G, signed Schedule A, and Agreement to Bond (from DEL-01-03); final file size = 14.9 MB.
6. Final compliance check by Proposal Manager against DEL-01-01 checklist; all items green.
7. Email sent to spendergast@townofpenhold.ca at 11:30 AM; auto-reply received at 11:35 AM.
8. Proposal Manager calls Sean Pendergast at 12:00 PM to verbally confirm receipt; contact confirms file received, opened cleanly.
9. Revision log closed; submission record filed.

**Result:** Compliant, on-time submission; no disqualification risk.

### EX-002: Addenda Acknowledgement Oversight (Recovery)

**Scenario:** Pricing team completes Schedule A pricing rows but leaves the addenda range field blank.

**Detected at:** DEL-01-01 compliance matrix review, 24 hours before deadline.

**Recovery:**
1. Proposal Manager alerts pricing team; range field completed: "Addendum 01 to Addendum 03."
2. Schedule A re-signed by CFO; scanned PDF updated.
3. PDF re-assembled with corrected Schedule A (only one page change).
4. If initial submission was already sent, increment to Revision 01; state "Revision 01 — Addenda Acknowledgement Correction" in subject line.
5. Confirm receipt of revised submission.

**Result:** Late-caught error corrected before deadline; no disqualification risk.

### EX-003: File Size Exceeds Limit (Triage)

**Scenario:** Initial PDF assembly = 18.2 MB (exceeds 15 MB limit).

**Triage:**
1. Compress photos/diagrams from 300 dpi to 250 dpi → file drops to 16.5 MB.
2. Remove secondary architectural render images (not RFP-mandatory) → file drops to 15.6 MB.
3. Summarize geotechnical appendix to 2-page summary (full report available on request) → file drops to 14.9 MB.
4. Re-test: opens cleanly, drawings legible, all content present.
5. Proceed to final assembly with signed Appendix G and Schedule A.

**Result:** Compliant with file size constraint; core content and all RFP-required drawings preserved.

### EX-004: Schedule B Bond Cost Missing (Recovery)

**Scenario:** Schedule B is submitted with "General Requirements" line blank; bond premium from DEL-01-03 has not yet been received.

**Detected at:** Internal review 48 hours before deadline.

**Recovery:**
1. Proposal Manager escalates to Commercial Lead (DEL-01-03 owner): bond premium needed within 24 hours.
2. Once received, bond premium entered in "General Requirements (Design and Engineering, Bonding etc.)" line; Schedule B totals recalculated.
3. Schedule A row 1-1 updated to match new Schedule B subtotal.
4. Schedule A and Schedule B re-signed; PDF re-assembled.

**Result:** Complete Schedule B with bond costs; no disqualification risk.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| CONF-01 | Bond documentation scope boundary: Specification R5 assigns verification of Agreement to Bond presence (and high-level content check) to DEL-01-02 assembly role, while decomposition assigns full production of Agreement to Bond to DEL-01-03 (SOW-0004). Risk: DEL-01-02 must receive the completed document from DEL-01-03 before assembly can be finalized. | Specification R5-01–R5-04 | Decomposition v2.3 §9 (DEL-01-03, SOW-0004) | Specification §R5; Datasheet Conditions; Procedure Prerequisites | DEL-01-03 produces the Agreement to Bond. DEL-01-02 integrates it into the PDF and performs a presence/legibility check only. Content verification (surety authorization, CCDC conformance, bond split) is DEL-01-03's responsibility. | TBD |
