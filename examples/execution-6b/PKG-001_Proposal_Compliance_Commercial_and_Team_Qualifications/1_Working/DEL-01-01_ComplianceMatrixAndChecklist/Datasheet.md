## Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scope Definition** | All mandatory requirements from Sections 4 (Submission Requirements), 5 (Instructions to Bidders), 6 (Mandatory Requirements), 7 (Technical Proposal Evaluation Criteria), 8 (Price Proposal Evaluation Criteria), and 9 (Appendices) shall be inventoried and mapped. Source: RFP AB-2024-07156, Sections 4-9. |
| **Addenda Precedence** | Any conflict between the base RFP and an addendum: **the addendum governs**. All three addenda (01, 02, 03) must be acknowledged in the proposal per RFP 2.9 and Appendix H. Source: Decomposition v2 section 3, governing rule. |
| **Compliance Gate** | This deliverable is a **pass/fail compliance gate** (OBJ-001: Pass all mandatory requirements). Failure to satisfy mandatory requirements, or incomplete addenda acknowledgement, may result in disqualification. Source: Decomposition v2 section 6, OBJ-001. |
| **PDF Size Constraint** | Proposal must be a single PDF at or under 15 MB, including all drawings and mandatory requirements (RFP 4.2, Decomposition C-01). Compliance matrix shall track page and size allocation to support this constraint. |
| **Section Order Constraint** | Proposal must use main headings and present information in the order of Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 (RFP 4.3, Decomposition C-02). Compliance matrix shall verify this sequencing at assembly. |
| **Pickled Sand Storage Exclusion** | The Pickled Sand Storage building is excluded from this proposal per Addendum 03 section 1.2 (Decomposition C-10). The compliance matrix shall confirm no scope, pricing, or team references include this item. |

## Construction

The Compliance Matrix and Checklist shall be constructed as follows:

### Matrix Structure

The primary spreadsheet shall contain these columns:

- **Column 1:** Requirement ID (e.g., "4.2", "5.3", "6.1", "7.1.2", "Add03 s1.18")
- **Column 2:** Requirement Statement (verbatim or concise paraphrase from source)
- **Column 3:** Mandatory / Optional flag (derived from RFP language)
- **Column 4:** Responsible Deliverable(s) (where requirement is addressed in the response)
- **Column 5:** Page Reference(s) (estimated during draft; confirmed at PDF assembly)
- **Column 6:** Compliance Status (In Progress / Complete / At Risk / Resolved)
- **Column 7:** Notes / Resolution Path (for at-risk items)

### Addenda Integration Checklist

A dedicated sub-table shall list:

| Addendum | Issue Date | Key Change | Affected Requirement(s) | Affected Deliverable(s) | Integration Status | Acknowledgement Completed? |
|----------|------------|------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 01 | Jul 11, 2024 | Bidders meeting date correction; missing dimensions intentional (design innovation) | Procedural only | (none requiring content change) | Integrated | Pending |
| 02 | Jul 15, 2024 | Pages 62-63 missing is formatting error; no information missing | (none) | N/A | N/A | Pending |
| 03 | Jul 31, 2024 | 12-acre site; pickled sand removed; program clarifications (sumps, doors, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar, FF&E, servicing, room sizes, second storey, security) | REQ-C-10, REQ-C-11, REQ-C-12, REQ-C-13 (16 ft overhead doors), REQ-C-14 (bay sumps), REQ-C-15 (fire apparatus direct exhaust), REQ-C-16 (backup generator min. loads), REQ-C-17 (2" water fill stations), REQ-C-18 (solar-capable roof), REQ-C-19 (40 bunker gear lockers), REQ-C-20 (room size ranges), REQ-C-21 (second storey option); SOW-0010; multiple technical deliverables | DEL-02-01 through DEL-02-05, DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05, DEL-01-06, DEL-01-09 | In Progress | Pending |

### Pass/Fail Risk Log

A separate table tracking:

- Risk ID
- Risk Description (e.g., "Page limit exceeded", "Appendix G not executed", "Bond document missing")
- Current Status (Green / Yellow / Red)
- Mitigation Strategy
- Owner (responsible party)
- Target Resolution Date

### Requirement-to-Deliverable Mapping Table

A supplementary mapping table cross-referencing each RFP section to the responsible deliverable and work package.

## Notes

- **ASSUMPTION:** The compliance matrix will be created using a spreadsheet tool (Excel or equivalent) to enable real-time status tracking and filtering during proposal development.
- **ASSUMPTION:** The matrix is a working document (internal to the proposal team) and is not included in the final submission PDF unless explicitly required by the Owner.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Page references will be estimated during draft development and confirmed at final PDF assembly.
- **TBD:** Exact page count allocation per section; to be refined during document assembly.
- **ASSUMPTION (best-effort, lensing item A-001):** Proposal Director is the binding compliance sign-off authority. **TBD** pending human confirmation; alternatives include PM, CFO, or Executive Committee.
- **ASSUMPTION (lensing item B-001):** Requirement IDs REQ-C-13 through REQ-C-21 have been assigned to Addendum 03 program clarifications that previously lacked formal identifiers. These IDs are provisional and subject to human confirmation. Source: Addendum 03 ss1.2-1.18; Decomposition v2 section 4.
