# Guidance: Compliance Matrix and Checklist

## Purpose

The Compliance Matrix and Checklist exists to ensure that:

1. **All mandatory RFP requirements are inventoried and traceable** to responsible proposal deliverables.
2. **All three addenda are properly integrated** into the proposal response and formally acknowledged in Appendix H per RFP 2.9.
3. **Pass/fail compliance risks are identified early and mitigated systematically**, reducing the likelihood of disqualification.
4. **The proposal passes the formal compliance gate** (OBJ-001: mandatory requirements satisfied), clearing the way for evaluation on technical and price criteria.

The Proposal Manager uses this deliverable as the single source of truth for compliance status. All team members reference it to understand what is required of them and to confirm that their deliverables satisfy the RFP.

### Scope Boundary Rationale (lensing item X-001)

The Specification explicitly excludes three categories from DEL-01-01 scope. The rationale for each boundary is:

- **Technical content of the proposal** (design narratives, pricing, team qualifications): These are produced by their respective work packages (PKG-002 through PKG-010). DEL-01-01 tracks and verifies that this content exists and is compliant, but does not produce it. This separation ensures the Proposal Manager can independently verify compliance without also being responsible for authoring technical content. Source: Decomposition v2 section 8, PKG-001 exclusions.
- **Actual proposal document assembly** (PDF compilation, email submission): Assembly is the responsibility of DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission Package). Separating compliance tracking from physical assembly prevents a single deliverable from becoming a bottleneck and ensures the compliance check occurs before assembly begins. Source: Decomposition v2 section 9, DEL-01-02 definition.
- **Bonding and insurance documentation**: This is the responsibility of DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance Evidence). Bond procurement involves external parties (surety companies) and legal requirements distinct from compliance tracking. DEL-01-01 verifies that the bond document is obtained and included, but does not manage its procurement. Source: Decomposition v2 section 9, DEL-01-03 definition.

## Principles

### P-001: Completeness Before Perfection

The compliance matrix must be comprehensive. Every section of the RFP and every addendum change must be inventoried, even if the response content is still in draft. A requirement cannot be missed if it is on the matrix.

**Why:** The compliance gate is binary (pass/fail). An oversight discovered late in proposal development can force costly rework or result in disqualification.

**Application:** Start with a full inventory in Week 1-2 of proposal development, then refine status and page references as content is drafted across the work packages.

### P-002: Addenda Govern

When the base RFP and an addendum appear to conflict, **the addendum statement governs**. Source: Decomposition v2 section 3, governing rule.

**Why:** Addenda are issued after the base RFP to clarify, correct, or modify requirements in response to bidder questions and site realities.

**Application by Addendum:**
- **Addendum 01 (Jul 11):** Bidders meeting date correction; missing dimensions are intentional (design innovation encouraged rather than prescribed dimensions).
- **Addendum 02 (Jul 15):** Pages 62-63 missing is a formatting error only; no information is missing from the RFP.
- **Addendum 03 (Jul 31) -- Highest-impact changes:** 12-acre developable site (of 20-acre total); pickled sand storage building excluded from this RFP; program clarifications (sumps in all bays, 16 ft overhead doors, fire apparatus direct exhaust, PW bay general ventilation, backup generator minimum loads, 2" water fill stations, solar-capable roof, 40 bunker gear lockers with room ventilation, FF&E as $20,000 cash allowance additional option only, site servicing cash allowance, survey files provided after award, room size ranges, second storey option for shared spaces, no Town preference on security/camera suppliers).

Source: Decomposition v2 section 4 (Addenda Integration Summary).

### P-003: Clear Ownership and Escalation

Every "At Risk" or Red compliance item must have a named owner, a documented mitigation strategy, and a target resolution date. Unresolved risks must be escalated to the Proposal Director promptly.

**Why:** Compliance risks do not resolve themselves. Without clear ownership, responsibility diffuses and risks slip through to the final assembly stage.

**Application:**
- Yellow items: Owner has a documented plan; status reviewed at weekly team sync. **Escalation trigger (lensing item X-004):** If a Yellow item remains unresolved for two consecutive **review-cycle weeks** (i.e., two consecutive weekly sync meetings where the item's status has not improved), it must be escalated to the Proposal Director by the end of the second review meeting. In the final two weeks of the proposal period (Weeks 5-6, relative to the August 30, 2024 submission deadline), any Yellow item not on track for resolution before the final compliance review shall be escalated immediately regardless of the two-week threshold. Source: Procedure Step 5 escalation criteria; lensing item X-004; **ASSUMPTION** on the interpretation of "two consecutive weeks" as review-cycle weeks.
- Red items: Escalated to Proposal Director immediately (same day); may require trade-off decisions (scope adjustment, resource addition, schedule pull-in).

### P-004: PDF Size and Section Order Are Hard Constraints

- **PDF Size:** Single PDF at or under 15 MB, including all drawings and mandatory requirements. Source: RFP 4.2; Decomposition C-01.
- **Section Order:** Use main headings; present information in the order of Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9. Source: RFP 4.3; Decomposition C-02.

**Why:** These are procedural requirements stated explicitly in the RFP. Non-compliance is grounds for disqualification.

**Application:** The compliance matrix allocates estimated page budget per section during draft development. The assembly checklist (DEL-01-02 supporting document) verifies the final PDF is at or under 15 MB and sections are in the prescribed order.

### P-005: Addenda Acknowledgement Is Non-Negotiable

Appendix H includes a line for acknowledging receipt and incorporation of all addenda. Failure to complete this line may **disqualify the price proposal**. Source: RFP 2.9; Appendix H; Decomposition C-07.

**Why:** This is the Owner's mechanism for confirming that the proponent is aware of all changes to the RFP scope, pricing, and requirements.

**Application:** The compliance matrix includes a dedicated sub-table for addenda acknowledgement status. At final review, Appendix H is verified for this line before submission.

## Considerations

### C-001: Spreadsheet Organization

The compliance matrix works best as a **filterable spreadsheet** with columns for:
- Requirement ID (hierarchical: e.g., "4.2", "5.3", "6.1", "7.1.2(1)", "Add03 s1.18")
- Requirement statement
- Mandatory vs. Optional flag
- Responsible deliverable(s)
- Page reference(s)
- Status (In Progress / Complete / At Risk / Resolved)
- Owner
- Notes / Mitigation strategy
- Target date (for At Risk items)

This structure allows the Proposal Manager to filter by status (show all At Risk items), sort by owner (distribute workload), and search by keyword (e.g., "Appendix H", "addenda", "12-acre").

### C-002: Deliverable-to-Requirement Mapping

The compliance matrix should cross-reference each RFP section to the responsible deliverable. The mapping below reflects the decomposition v2 deliverable structure:

| RFP Section | Responsible Deliverable(s) |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 4.2 (PDF size) | DEL-01-02 (assembly) |
| 5.2 (authorized signature) | DEL-01-02 (Letter of Offer) |
| 6.1 (Appendix G) | DEL-01-02 |
| 6.2 (Agreement to Bond) | DEL-01-03 |
| 7.1.1 (Conceptual Design) | DEL-02-01 through DEL-02-05 (PKG-002) |
| 7.1.2 (Design Brief) | DEL-03-01 through DEL-03-05 (PKG-003) |
| 7.1.3 (Accessibility) | DEL-03-06 (PKG-003) |
| 7.1.4 (Durability and Maintenance) | DEL-05-01 through DEL-05-04 (PKG-005) |
| 7.1.5 (Adaptability) | DEL-03-06 (PKG-003) |
| 7.1.6 (Firm Experience) | DEL-01-07 (PKG-001) |
| 7.1.7 (Key Resumes) | DEL-01-08 (PKG-001) |
| 7.1.8 (Design and Construction Docs Plan) | DEL-06-01, DEL-06-02 (PKG-006) |
| 7.1.9 (Project Schedule) | DEL-09-01 (PKG-009) |
| 7.2 (Construction Methodology) | DEL-07-01, DEL-07-05 (PKG-007) |
| 7.3 (Construction Administration) | DEL-07-02, DEL-07-03, DEL-07-04 (PKG-007) |
| 7.4 (Survey/Due Diligence) | DEL-10-02 (PKG-010) |
| 7.5 (Risk Register) | DEL-10-01 (PKG-010) |
| 7.6 (Warranty) | DEL-08-03 (PKG-008) |
| 8.1 (Schedule A) | DEL-01-04 (PKG-001) |
| 8.2 (Schedule B) | DEL-01-05 (PKG-001) |
| 8.3/8.5 (Pricing Narrative / Alternatives) | DEL-01-06 (PKG-001) |
| Appendix I | DEL-01-09 (PKG-001) |

This mapping enables the Compliance Matrix to function as a **master index** for all proposal content.

### C-003: Addenda Tracking Sub-Table

Include a dedicated addenda integration sub-table (see Datasheet Construction section). Key items to confirm for Addendum 03:
- 12-acre site reflected in site concept (DEL-02-02)
- Pickled sand storage absent from all concept drawings, pricing, and team lists
- 16 ft overhead doors addressed in architectural concept (DEL-02-01) and pricing (DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05)
- Bay sumps addressed in mechanical and structural narratives (DEL-02-03, DEL-02-04)
- Direct exhaust addressed in mechanical concept (DEL-02-04)
- Backup generator minimum loads addressed in mechanical and electrical narratives (DEL-02-04, DEL-02-05)
- 2" water fill stations (1 fire bay, 1 PW bay) addressed in mechanical narrative (DEL-02-04)
- Solar-capable roof and orientation addressed in electrical narrative (DEL-02-05) and sustainability (DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, DEL-04-03) (lensing item F-002: aligned with Specification cross-references which include DEL-04-01 Building Envelope and Energy Strategy)
- 40 bunker gear lockers with ventilated room addressed in architectural concept (DEL-02-01)
- FF&E as $20,000 cash allowance in Schedule A line 1-7 and Schedule B Additional Item 6 (DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05)
- Site servicing cash allowance acknowledged in Schedule B and pricing narrative (DEL-01-05, DEL-01-06)

### C-004: Pass/Fail Risk Escalation

Maintain a dedicated Pass/Fail Risk Log identifying items that could cause disqualification:

| Risk ID | Description | Status | Owner | Mitigation | Target Date |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|-----------|------------|
| P-01 | Appendix H addenda acknowledgement line incomplete | Yellow | Est. Mgr | Schedule completion as final check before assembly | TBD |
| P-02 | Bond / Agreement to Bond not yet received from surety | Yellow | Comm. Lead | Follow up with surety; escalate if not received by Aug 20 | Aug 20 |
| P-03 | Final PDF size exceeds 15 MB due to drawing volume | Yellow | PM | Evaluate drawing resolution and compression; consider schematic simplification | Aug 22 |
| P-04 | Appendix G (Letter of Offer) not yet executed | Yellow | Proposal Mgr | Confirm signatory authority; prepare execution package | Aug 25 |

Items marked Red are escalated to the Proposal Director the same day. Items marked Yellow are monitored at weekly sync and escalated if unresolved for two consecutive weeks.

### C-006: Post-Submission Value of the Compliance Matrix (lensing item C-002)

The archived compliance matrix serves ongoing value beyond the compliance gate:

- **Owner Clarification Requests:** If the Owner requests clarification on any aspect of the proposal (per RFP evaluation process), the compliance matrix provides an immediate index to locate which deliverable and page addressed each requirement. This speeds response time and reduces risk of inconsistent answers.
- **Contract Negotiation:** During contract negotiation, the compliance matrix demonstrates that all RFP requirements were addressed, supporting the proponent's position that the proposal is fully responsive.
- **Lessons Learned:** Post-submission review of the compliance matrix identifies process improvements for future proposals: which requirements were most difficult to track, where escalation was needed, how well the weekly review cadence worked, and whether the page budget allocations were realistic.

> Source: Procedure.md Records section ("retained for post-submission review"); **ASSUMPTION** that this rationale reflects standard proposal management practice.

### C-005: Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **Week 1** | Inventory all RFP + addenda requirements; establish baseline compliance matrix |
| **Week 2** | Assign ownership; set page budgets per section; create addenda sub-table |
| **Weeks 3-5** | Weekly status reviews; track addenda integration; escalate At Risk items |
| **Week 5-6** | Draft assembly begins; confirm page references and PDF size |
| **Week 6 (final)** | Final compliance sign-off; all items marked Green or Accepted Risk; addenda acknowledgement verified |

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Content Scope vs. PDF Size Budget

If the proposal approaches the 15 MB limit (all drawings and content combined), trade-offs must be decided:

**Option A: Reduce narrative depth.**
- Shorter sections, more visual content, summary bullets.
- Risk: Evaluator may find proposal less persuasive on scored technical criteria.

**Option B: Reduce drawing resolution or detail.**
- Simplify architectural, civil, structural drawings; convey key concepts schematically.
- Risk: Technical evaluation may suffer if drawings are unclear or fail to demonstrate design competence.

**Option C: Prioritize scored content over procedural content.**
- Where the RFP does not explicitly require depth (e.g., some Section 4/5 procedural items), keep those sections minimal to preserve space for the 65-point technical criteria.
- Risk: Low if handled deliberately; not a compliance risk for most format items.

> **RFP Evaluation Scoring Weights (lensing item E-002):** The RFP uses a 100-point evaluation framework: **Technical = 65 points** (Conceptual Design 20, Durability/Maintenance 15, Team/Firm Experience 15, Design Brief 5, Delivery Plan [Design Methodology 3 + Construction Methodology 3 + Commissioning 2 + Schedule 2] = 10) and **Price = 35 points** (Appendix H pricing). Source: Decomposition v2 sections 6 and 15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk); RFP Section 3 (**location TBD** for exact clause). The compliance matrix priorities should account for this weighting: scored items (especially the 20-point Conceptual Design and 15-point Durability/Maintenance) warrant proportionally more page budget and compliance attention than pass/fail procedural items that are not separately scored.

**Decision Authority:** Proposal Director, in consultation with PM and technical leads.

### T-002: Addendum 03 Cost Impacts

Addendum 03 adds mandatory program requirements (16 ft doors, sumps, direct exhaust, backup generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof, 40 bunker gear lockers, room size ranges). These are all **mandatory scope items** that must be reflected in the concept design and pricing.

**Consideration:** Some clarifications may increase cost compared to an earlier pre-addendum design concept. The compliance matrix should flag if any Addendum 03 item has not yet been reflected in pricing.

**Trade-off:** Evaluate whether the design concept remains cost-competitive given these clarifications. Cost risk items should be addressed in:
- The risk register (DEL-10-01)
- The pricing narrative (DEL-01-06) as a documented assumption
- The design concept (PKG-002 deliverables) as an innovative approach to minimize cost impact

**Decision Authority:** Proposal Director + Estimator + Lead Designer.

### T-003: Execution Authority and Legal Form

RFP 5.2 requires that the proposal be "properly executed" with "authorized signature and seal requirements per proponent legal form." Source: Decomposition C-03.

The proponent's legal structure determines the signature approach:
- **Partnership:** Signed by authorized partners.
- **Corporation:** Signed by CEO, President, or authorized officer; affixed with corporate seal.
- **Joint Venture:** All joint venture partners must sign, or a power of attorney must authorize one signatory.

**Compliance Matrix Item:** Flag the Appendix G execution requirement and verify that the signatory has authority to bind the proponent entity.

## Examples

### EX-001: Tracking an Addendum Change

**Base RFP (Section 7.1.1):** "Proposal shall include pickled sand storage building design and cost estimate."

**Addendum 03 (section 1.2):** "Pickled sand storage building is excluded from this RFP; a future separate RFP will address."

**Compliance Matrix Entry:**

| Req ID | Statement | Source | Mandatory | Responsible Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| REQ-C-10 | Pickled sand storage excluded; not included in proposal scope or pricing. | Add 03 s1.2 | Yes | DEL-02-01 (site plan), DEL-02-02 (civil plan), DEL-01-04 (Schedule A), DEL-01-05 (Schedule B), DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) | In Progress | Site plan must show 12-acre developable area without sand storage footprint. Pricing must exclude sand building scope. Team list must not reference sand building subtrades. Addenda acknowledgement line in Appendix H required. |

This entry ensures that all documents are aligned and that no portion of the proposal accidentally includes sand storage scope.

### EX-002: Risk Item Escalation

**Initial Status (Week 3):** Bond document has been requested from the surety but not yet received.

| Risk ID | Description | Status | Owner | Mitigation | Target Date |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|-----------|------------|
| P-02 | Agreement to Bond not received from surety (Performance Bond 50% + Labour & Materials Bond 50%). | Yellow | Comm. Lead | Follow-up email sent; phone call if no response by Aug 18. | Aug 20 |

**Escalation (Week 5, if still unresolved):**

| Risk ID | Description | Status | Owner | Mitigation | Target Date |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|-----------|------------|
| P-02 | Agreement to Bond not received from surety; impacts DEL-01-03 (Bonding Evidence). | Red | Prop. Director | ESCALATED. Consider: (1) contact surety VP directly; (2) source alternate Alberta-authorized surety; (3) confirm if Owner permits bond to follow within 5 days of award notification. Decision needed by Aug 20. | Aug 20 |

**Resolution (post-escalation):** Proposal Director sources alternate surety. Bond received by Aug 25; status returns to Green.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| (none identified) | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |

No conflicts between base RFP and addenda requirements remain unresolved in this deliverable's scope. All Addendum 03 impacts have been catalogued in the addenda integration sub-table.

---

## Notes

- **ASSUMPTION:** The compliance matrix is maintained by the Proposal Manager as a live document throughout proposal development, updated at weekly team sync meetings.
- **ASSUMPTION:** RFP Sections 4 and 5 contain mostly format and procedural requirements rather than substantive technical requirements; inventoried for completeness but do not require separate narrative responses.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Addendum 03 has the most significant scope impact; Addenda 01 and 02 have minimal or procedural impact only.
- **ASSUMPTION:** The compliance matrix is an internal working document and is not included in the final submission PDF unless explicitly required by the Owner.
- **ASSUMPTION (lensing item E-001):** "Proposal Director" is the standardized term for the final compliance sign-off authority across all four documents. **TBD** pending human confirmation; alternatives previously mentioned include PM, CFO, or Executive Committee. This normalization eliminates terminological inconsistency identified across Datasheet (Approval Authority), Guidance (Notes), and Procedure (Notes).
- **TBD:** Escalation frequency (weekly, or trigger-based for Red items).
