> **ASSUMPTION:** The 6-week period starts on approximately July 22, 2024 (following Addendum 03 issuance on July 31, the baseline matrix may be retroactively updated in Week 2 to incorporate Addendum 03). The exact start date is **TBD** pending proposal kickoff. Source: Guidance.md C-005 (Timeline); Decomposition v2 section 1 (submission deadline); lensing item D-001.

### Step 1: Create the Baseline Compliance Matrix (Week 1)

**Owner:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**

1. Open a new spreadsheet with the following columns:
   - **Column A:** Requirement ID (e.g., "4.2", "5.3", "6.1", "7.1.2", "Add03 s1.18")
   - **Column B:** Requirement Statement (verbatim or concise paraphrase from RFP or addendum)
   - **Column C:** Source (e.g., "RFP 4.2", "Addendum 03 s1.2")
   - **Column D:** Mandatory / Optional (Yes / No)
   - **Column E:** Responsible Deliverable(s) (e.g., "DEL-01-04, Schedule A"; "PKG-002 deliverables"; "DEL-07-01")
   - **Column F:** Status (In Progress / Complete / At Risk / Resolved)
   - **Column G:** Page Reference(s) (TBD; filled during draft assembly)
   - **Column H:** Notes / Mitigation

2. **Inventory RFP Sections 4 through 9:**
   - Section 4 (Submission Requirements): Single PDF under 15 MB; section order (6, 7, 8, 9); use of Appendix H and I templates
   - Section 5 (Instructions to Bidders): Submission deadline (Aug 30, 2024 @ 2:00 PM MST); email submission; revision control; authorized signature/seal; Agreement to Bond
   - Section 6 (Mandatory Requirements): Letter of Offer (Appendix G); Agreement to Bond
   - Section 7 (Technical Proposal): All subsections 7.1.1 through 7.6 (see Specification.md Technical Proposal table for the full mapping)
   - Section 8 (Price Proposal): Appendix H Schedules A and B; pricing narrative; value alternatives; addenda acknowledgement line
   - Section 9 (Appendices): Note all required appendices (G, H, I, J)

3. **Inventory All Addenda:**
   - **Addendum 01:** Bidders meeting date corrected to July 25; missing functional program dimensions are intentional.
   - **Addendum 02:** Pages 62-63 absence is formatting error; no information missing.
   - **Addendum 03:** 12-acre developable site confirmed; pickled sand storage removed; program clarifications (sumps in all bays; 16 ft overhead doors; fire apparatus direct exhaust; PW bay general ventilation; backup generator minimum loads; 2" fill stations (1 fire, 1 PW); solar-capable roof orientation; 40 bunker gear lockers with ventilated room; FF&E as $20,000 cash allowance Additional Option 6; site servicing cash allowance; survey files provided after award; room size ranges; second storey option for shared spaces; no Town preference on security/camera suppliers).

4. **Mark All Entries as "In Progress" for Status:**
   - Initial matrix is a baseline; status is refined as proposal development proceeds.

5. **Save and Share:**
   - Save to shared project location accessible to Proposal Director, PM, Estimator, and technical leads.

6. **Establish Version Control (lensing item X-002):**
   - Save the baseline matrix using a filename convention that includes the date and version number: e.g., `ComplianceMatrix_2024-07-26_v1.0.xlsx`.
   - Create a **Version Log** (either as a dedicated sheet within the workbook or as a header table in the primary sheet) with the following columns:
     - **Version Number** (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
     - **Date** (YYYY-MM-DD)
     - **Editor** (name of person making the update)
     - **Summary of Changes** (brief description of what changed)
   - **Storage location:** Designate a single shared folder for all matrix versions. Do not overwrite previous versions; save each weekly update as a new dated file (e.g., `ComplianceMatrix_2024-08-09_v1.3.xlsx`).
   - At final compliance review (Step 6), the version log shall demonstrate a complete audit trail from baseline to final version.
   > **ASSUMPTION:** Version control follows the filename convention established in Specification REQ-C-04 compliance approach. Source: Specification.md REQ-C-04; lensing item X-002.

**Deliverable:** Baseline compliance matrix spreadsheet (estimate: 100+ rows depending on RFP detail level).

---

### Step 2: Conduct Requirement Inventory Review and Assign Ownership (Weeks 1-2)

**Owner:** Proposal Manager (facilitation); all team leads (input)

**Action:**

1. **Schedule a kickoff team meeting** (all proposal leads: commercial, estimator, design, construction, schedule, risk).

2. **Walk through the matrix:** For each requirement, identify:
   - Which deliverable(s) will address this requirement?
   - Who is the primary responsible owner?
   - Are there dependencies or conflicts with other requirements?

3. **Add ownership columns:**
   - **Column I:** Primary Owner (deliverable lead or team member name)
   - **Column J:** Target Completion Date (mapped to proposal development timeline)

4. **Identify and flag early risks:**
   - Does the team have sufficient time and resources to complete this requirement?
   - Are there any known conflicts or ambiguities in the RFP that need Owner clarification?
   - Which requirements depend on Addendum 03 integration (highest risk area)?

5. **Document assumptions and open questions:**
   - If the RFP is ambiguous, note it as a question or ASSUMPTION.
   - Escalate to Proposal Director if Owner clarification is needed.

6. **Create the Pass/Fail Risk Log:**
   - Identify items that, if missed, would result in disqualification.
   - Known high-risk items: Appendix H addenda acknowledgement line; Agreement to Bond; Appendix G execution; section order; PDF size.
   - Create a table with: Risk ID, Description, Status (Green/Yellow/Red), Owner, Mitigation, Target Date.

**Deliverable:** Updated compliance matrix with ownership and timeline; Pass/Fail Risk Log.

---

### Step 3: Create the Addenda Integration Checklist Sub-Table (Week 2)

**Owner:** Proposal Manager

**Action:**

1. Create a sub-table or dedicated sheet titled "Addenda Integration Checklist" with these columns:

   | Addendum | Issue Date | Key Change | Affected Requirement(s) | Affected Deliverable(s) | Integration Status | Acknowledgement Completed? |

2. **Populate Addendum 01 row:**
   - Key Change: Bidders meeting corrected to July 25; missing dimensions intentional (design innovation)
   - Affected Deliverable(s): None requiring content change; minor note in proposal where relevant
   - Integration Status: Integrated
   - Acknowledgement: Pending (to be confirmed in Appendix H)

3. **Populate Addendum 02 row:**
   - Key Change: Pages 62-63 absence is formatting error; no missing information
   - Affected Deliverable(s): N/A
   - Integration Status: N/A (clarification only)
   - Acknowledgement: Pending (to be confirmed in Appendix H)

4. **Populate Addendum 03 row with detail by impact area:**
   - 12-acre site -> DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept)
   - Pickled sand storage removed -> DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05, DEL-01-09
   - 16 ft overhead doors -> DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept), DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05
   - Bay sumps -> DEL-02-03 (Structural Narrative), DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Narrative)
   - Fire apparatus direct exhaust -> DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Narrative)
   - PW bay general ventilation -> DEL-02-04
   - Backup generator minimum loads -> DEL-02-04, DEL-02-05 (Electrical/IT Narrative)
   - 2" fill stations (1 fire, 1 PW) -> DEL-02-04
   - Solar-capable roof / orientation -> DEL-02-05, DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, DEL-04-03
   - 40 bunker gear lockers + room ventilation -> DEL-02-01
   - FF&E as $20,000 cash allowance Add Option 6 -> DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05, DEL-01-06
   - Site servicing cash allowance -> DEL-01-05, DEL-01-06
   - Room size ranges -> DEL-02-01
   - Integration Status: In Progress
   - Acknowledgement: Pending

5. **Add a note on the acknowledgement line:**
   "Appendix H Schedule A includes an addenda acknowledgement line. The completed form must state acknowledgement of Addenda 01, 02, and 03 (with dates) and be signed by the authorized officer."

**Deliverable:** Addenda Integration Checklist sub-table.

---

### Step 4: Map Requirements to Deliverables (Weeks 2-3)

**Owner:** Proposal Manager (coordination); all team leads (validation)

**Action:**

1. **Create a Requirement-to-Deliverable Mapping Table** showing which RFP section maps to which deliverable and work package. Reference table from Guidance.md C-002 as a starting structure.

2. **Validate the mapping:**
   - Is every mandatory requirement mapped to at least one deliverable?
   - Are there any unmapped requirements (gaps)?
   - For overlapping coverage (one requirement addressed by multiple deliverables), designate a primary deliverable and supporting roles.

3. **Share the mapping with team leads:**
   - Ensures each lead understands which requirements they are responsible for.
   - Clarifies dependencies (e.g., Schedule A in DEL-01-04 depends on scope confirmed by PKG-002 through PKG-010 deliverables).

**Deliverable:** Requirement-to-Deliverable Mapping Table.

---

### Step 5: Weekly Compliance Status Reviews (Weeks 3-6)

**Owner:** Proposal Manager (facilitation); all team leads (status reports)

**Action:**

1. **Schedule weekly 30-minute sync meetings** (consistent day and time throughout proposal development period).

2. **Standard agenda:**
   - Pass/Fail Risk Log review: Any items changed from Green/Yellow to Red? Any new risks identified?
   - Addendum 03 integration status: Which of the Addendum 03 impacts are now fully integrated into their responsible deliverables?
   - Compliance Matrix highlights: Which In Progress items moved to Complete? Any blockers?
   - Escalations: Items requiring Proposal Director decision.

3. **For each At Risk item:**
   - Owner presents: What is the issue? What is the mitigation plan? What is needed to resolve to Green?
   - Team provides support (resources, decisions, clarifications).
   - If no clear resolution path: escalate to Proposal Director.

4. **Update matrix after each meeting:**
   - Status changes (In Progress to Complete; Yellow to Green)
   - New risks added
   - Owner/date adjustments
   - Notes on decisions made

5. **Weekly Review Effectiveness Metric (lensing item D-002):**
   Track the following dashboard indicators at each weekly review:
   - **Items resolved this week:** Count of items moving from "In Progress" or "At Risk" to "Complete" or "Resolved" since the previous review.
   - **Items remaining "In Progress":** Total count of items still in progress.
   - **Velocity flag:** If fewer than **TBD** items resolve per review cycle (proposed: 15 items per week in Weeks 2-4, adjustable based on total requirement count), flag the compliance effort as potentially behind schedule and discuss resource reallocation.
   - **Risk trend:** Count of items that worsened (moved from Green to Yellow, or Yellow to Red) since the previous review.

   > **ASSUMPTION:** These metrics are proposed benchmarks; exact thresholds are **TBD** pending human confirmation based on actual requirement count and team capacity. Source: Procedure Step 5; Specification Verification (intermediate thresholds); lensing item D-002.

6. **Escalation criteria:**
   - Any Red item: escalate to Proposal Director the same day.
   - Any Yellow item unresolved for two consecutive weekly reviews: escalate.
   - Any new dependency conflict: escalate.

**Deliverable:** Weekly meeting minutes or status update record; updated compliance matrix.

---

### Step 6: Final Compliance Review and Sign-Off (Week 6, prior to submission)

   - All page references are filled in from the draft assembly: confirmed
   - Final assembled PDF is at or under 15 MB: confirmed
   - Section order (6, 7, 8, 9) is verified in final PDF: confirmed

2. **Addenda Acknowledgement Check:**
   - Appendix H (DEL-01-04) includes the addenda acknowledgement line: confirmed
   - Line states receipt of Addenda 01, 02, and 03 (with issue dates): confirmed
   - Signed and dated by authorized officer: confirmed

3. **Pass/Fail Risk Log clearance:**
   - All items Green, OR

## Notes

- **ASSUMPTION:** The compliance matrix is a working and internal document. It is not included in the final submission PDF unless explicitly required by the Owner.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Weekly status reviews require approximately 30 minutes and attendance from all team leads (or status submitted by email prior to meeting if attendance is not possible).
- **ASSUMPTION:** The Proposal Director reviews and approves the final compliance matrix during Week 6 (before submission) as part of the proposal approval process.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Addendum 03 has the most content and compliance impact of the three addenda; weekly tracking of Addendum 03 integration is critical from Week 2 onward.
- **ASSUMPTION (lensing item E-001):** "Proposal Director" is the standardized term for the final compliance sign-off authority, consistent with Datasheet (Approval Authority), Specification (Notes), and Guidance (Notes). **TBD** pending human confirmation; alternatives include PM, CFO, or Executive Committee.
- **TBD (lensing item A-002):** Acceptance criteria at final review -- whether Yellow items are acceptable or all items must be Green before sign-off. See Specification.md Verification section item 5.
