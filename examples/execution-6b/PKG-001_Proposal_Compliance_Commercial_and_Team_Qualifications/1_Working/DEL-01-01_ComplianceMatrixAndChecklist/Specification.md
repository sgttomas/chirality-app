# Specification: Compliance Matrix and Checklist

## Scope

The Compliance Matrix and Checklist deliverable covers:

- **Requirement Mapping:** All mandatory requirements from RFP Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 shall be inventoried, cross-referenced to responsible proposal deliverables and sections, and tracked to completion.
- **Addenda Integration:** All three addenda (01, 02, 03) shall be verified for integration into proposal content, pricing, and formal acknowledgement in Appendix H.
- **Risk Tracking:** Pass/fail compliance risks and their resolution paths shall be documented and monitored throughout proposal development.
- **Gate Function:** This deliverable serves as the formal compliance gate for the proposal. Source: Decomposition v2 section 6, OBJ-001 (Pass all mandatory requirements; failure = disqualification).

The deliverable does **not** include:
- Technical content of the proposal (design narratives, pricing, team qualifications)
- Actual proposal document assembly (that is DEL-01-02)
- Bonding and insurance documentation (that is DEL-01-03)

## Verification

### Compliance Matrix Sign-Off

The completed compliance matrix shall be verified by:

1. **Inventory Verification:** All requirements from Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are listed (completeness check). **Quantitative benchmark (lensing items A-003, A-004):** The baseline matrix shall contain rows covering every subsection enumerated below, with an expected minimum of **100 requirement rows** (estimate per Procedure Step 1). The completeness check shall confirm explicit coverage of the following RFP subsections: 4.2, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.3.1, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1.1, 7.1.2 (all 5 sub-briefs), 7.1.3, 7.1.4, 7.1.5, 7.1.6, 7.1.7, 7.1.8, 7.1.9, 7.2, 7.3 (7.3.1-7.3.7), 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5, Appendix G, Appendix H (including addenda acknowledgement line), Appendix I, Appendix J (acknowledgement). **ASSUMPTION:** The 100-row estimate is informational; the enumerated subsection list is the binding completeness criterion. Source: RFP Sections 4-9; Procedure.md Step 1; lensing items A-003, A-004.
2. **Mapping Verification:** Each requirement is mapped to at least one responsible deliverable or proposal section.
3. **Page Reference Verification:** All page references are confirmed during draft assembly.
4. **Status Verification:** All "At Risk" items have documented mitigation strategies and named owners.
5. **Acceptance Criteria for Final Review (lensing item A-002):** At final compliance review (Procedure Step 6), the sign-off decision shall apply one of the following criteria (**TBD** pending human ruling): **(a)** All items must be Green before sign-off, OR **(b)** Yellow items are acceptable if each has a documented mitigation plan and Proposal Director explicit acceptance. Red items are never acceptable at sign-off. Source: Procedure.md Step 6; lensing item A-002.

### Addenda Checklist Verification

1. **Completeness Check:** All three addenda (01, 02, 03) are referenced in the sub-table.
2. **Acknowledgement Check:** Appendix H addenda acknowledgement line is confirmed filled (yes / pending).
3. **Integration Check:** All addenda changes are reflected in proposal content and pricing deliverables.

### Intermediate Compliance Evaluation Criteria (lensing item X-003)

In-process judgment thresholds for weekly compliance reviews:

| Checkpoint | Target | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **By Week 2** | 100% of mandatory items inventoried; 100% assigned to a responsible deliverable and owner | Ensures baseline completeness before detailed tracking begins |
| **By Week 3** | At least 80% of mandatory items shall have a status other than "In Progress" (i.e., moved to Complete, At Risk with mitigation, or Resolved) | Ensures substantive progress is underway at proposal midpoint |
| **By Week 5** | No more than 10% of mandatory items remain "In Progress"; all Red items have escalation memos | Ensures readiness for final assembly in Week 5-6 |

> **ASSUMPTION:** These intermediate thresholds are proposed benchmarks; exact percentages are **TBD** pending human confirmation. Source: Specification Verification section; Procedure Steps 1-5; lensing item X-003.

### Pass/Fail Risk Items Verification

1. **Risk Inventory:** All known pass/fail risks are listed in the risk log.
2. **Mitigation Tracking:** Each Red or Yellow item has a documented owner and target resolution date.
3. **Final Clearance:** At proposal assembly, all items shall be marked "Green" or formally accepted as "Accepted Risk" by Proposal Director.

## Notes

- **ASSUMPTION:** The compliance matrix is a working document maintained by the Proposal Manager throughout proposal development (proposal start through final assembly). It is not a submission artifact unless explicitly required by the Owner.
- **ASSUMPTION:** RFP Sections 4 and 5 contain mostly procedural and format requirements rather than substantive technical requirements; these are inventoried for completeness but do not require separate technical narrative responses.
- **ASSUMPTION (lensing item E-001):** "Proposal Director" is the consistent term for the final compliance sign-off authority across all four documents. **TBD** pending human confirmation; alternatives include PM, CFO, or Executive Committee. See also Datasheet Approval Authority, Guidance Notes, Procedure Notes.
- **TBD:** Exact page budget per RFP section; refinement during draft assembly.
- **TBD (lensing item A-002):** Acceptance criteria at final review -- whether Yellow items are acceptable or all items must be Green before sign-off. See Verification section item 5.
