## Steps

### Step 1 — Establish Firm Identification and Consultant Team List

**Objective:** Confirm and document the Design-Builder entity identity and the complete list of consultant firms and subtrades to be identified per RFP 7.1.6.

**Actions:**

1. Confirm the Design-Builder's legal entity name, jurisdiction of incorporation, years in business, and primary service regions.
2. Compile the list of key consultant firms for this proposal:
   - Architecture firm (name, location)
   - Civil engineering firm (name, location)
   - Structural engineering firm (name, location)
   - Mechanical engineering firm (name, location)
   - Electrical engineering firm (name, location)
   - Any specialty consultants (e.g., building science, commissioning)
3. Compile the list of major subtrades (coordinate with Proposal Manager and DEL-01-09 lead):
   - Mechanical subtrades (plumbing, HVAC, fire protection)
   - Electrical subtrades
   - Concrete / structural subtrades
   - Other major scopes
4. Cross-check the compiled list against DEL-01-09 draft Appendix I. Ensure every firm named in this deliverable appears in Appendix I.
5. Document any firms that are TBD at this stage; note them as TBD in the narrative and confirm target date for finalization.

**Verification:**
- Design-Builder entity confirmed; all identification fields populated
- All key consultant firms identified with names and locations
- Confirmed consistency with DEL-01-09 draft
- TBD entries flagged and dated for resolution

---

### Step 2 — Assemble and Score Candidate Projects

**Objective:** Compile a shortlist of comparable project examples from the firm's portfolio to select the best evidence for Penhold PSB comparability.

**Actions:**

1. Query firm project database for all Design-Build (or comparable) projects completed in the past 10-15 years.
2. Filter for relevance to Penhold PSB:
   - Facility type: fire halls (priority 1), public works operations (priority 2), combined municipal services (priority 3), institutional/municipal (secondary)
   - Delivery method: Design-Build preferred; Design-Bid-Build with design leadership acceptable
   - Scale: comparable municipal-scale projects ($2M-$50M+ range)
   - Client type: municipal, regional, or institutional public-sector
3. For each candidate project, populate a project sheet:
   - Project name, location, year of substantial completion
   - Client name and primary contact
   - Facility type and building size (sq ft)
   - Contract value (base scope)
   - Delivery method and contract form
   - Team roles (architect, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, PM)
   - Schedule performance (planned vs. actual; reason for any deviation)
   - Budget performance (within base contract; change order rationale if applicable)
   - Specific systems or features relevant to Penhold PSB Addendum 03 requirements (apparatus bay exhaust, sumps, generator, fill stations, solar roof, bunker gear storage, combined operations)
   - Client contact willing to serve as reference: Yes / No / TBD
4. Score each candidate project against comparability criteria:
   - Fire/PW/combined facility type (0-3 points)
   - Design-Build delivery (0-2 points)
   - Key team continuity (named personnel available for Penhold PSB) (0-2 points)
   - Schedule/budget performance record (0-2 points)
   - Recency (past 10 years preferred) (0-1 point)
   - Addendum 03 system relevance (apparatus exhaust, generator, etc.) (0-2 points)
5. Rank top 3-5 projects by total score; recommend for selection.

**Verification:**
- Minimum 6 candidate projects identified
- All projects are verifiable from firm records
- Scoring matrix completed for each candidate
- Top 3-5 recommended and documented

---

### Step 3 — Confirm Key Personnel Availability and Client References

**Objective:** Verify that named personnel from selected projects are available for Penhold PSB and that client references are willing and prepared.

**Actions:**

1. For each selected project, confirm whether the key personnel named (architect, engineers, PM) are:
   - Available and proposed as leads for Penhold PSB (cite DEL-01-08 role) — preferred
   - Available in an advisory/principal capacity only — note in narrative
   - No longer with the firm or unavailable — do not name; note firm's institutional continuity instead
2. Document availability confirmation in resource plan; cross-reference with project schedule (DEL-09-01) when available.
3. Contact primary client reference for each selected project:
   - Confirm project facts (delivery outcome, client satisfaction) with client contact
   - Confirm client willingness to be contacted by Evaluation Committee during RFP review
   - Obtain current contact information: name, title, phone, email
   - Verify contact has authority to speak to project performance
   - Send brief confirmatory email and file response
4. Update project portfolio with confirmed reference contacts and availability flags.
5. If a preferred project's client reference is unavailable: substitute next-best project from ranked list.

**Verification:**
- All selected projects have confirmed client references (name, title, phone, email)
- Client contacts are current, willing, and confirmed in writing
- Key team member availability for Penhold PSB is documented for each named individual
- Resource plan cross-reference recorded

---

### Step 4 — Draft Firm Profile Narrative

**Objective:** Author the complete Section 7.1.6 narrative, including firm identification, project summaries, track record, and references.

**Actions:**

1. Draft **Firm Identification Block** (see Guidance EX-002 for structure):
   - Design-Builder legal name, jurisdiction, years in business, service regions
   - Brief capability statement (Design-Build focus, municipal/institutional specialization)
   - List of key consultant firms and subtrades with scope assignments
2. Draft **Project Summary Blocks** for each selected project (target 0.5-0.75 pages each; see Guidance EX-001 for structure):
   - **Header:** Project name, location, completion year
   - **Scope paragraph:** Facility type, building size, program elements, delivery method, contract form, team leadership
   - **Delivery paragraph:** Schedule and budget outcome; specific challenges and how addressed
   - **Relevance bridge (mandatory):** Explicit statement connecting this project to Penhold PSB — facility type, technical systems, team capability, or scope similarity
   - **Reference line:** Client contact name, title, phone, email
3. Draft **Delivery Track Record Statement** (1 paragraph):
   - Quantified if possible (e.g., "X of Y projects delivered on schedule over past 10 years")
   - Qualitative if quantification is not feasible; specific project examples anchoring any claim
   - Address any known outlier project honestly (avoid surprises in reference calls)
4. Apply Guidance Principles throughout:
   - P-001: Both components of RFP 7.1.6 present (firms/subtrades identified; experience described)
   - P-003: All claims named and verifiable — no generic assertions
   - P-004: Relevance bridge in every project summary
   - P-005: Terminology and names consistent with DEL-01-08 and DEL-01-09
5. Integrate Addendum 03 context where applicable (see Guidance C-005):
   - If any comparable project included apparatus bay exhaust, sumps, backup generator for critical loads, fill stations, solar-capable roof, or bunker gear storage — call it out explicitly in the relevance bridge.
   - This is a differentiating factor that demonstrates operational facility expertise beyond a generic municipal building.

**Verification:**
- Firm identification block complete with all fields
- All 3-5 project summaries drafted following EX-001 structure
- Every project summary includes a relevance bridge
- Track record statement present
- No unsupported claims
- Addendum 03 relevant experience highlighted where applicable
- Terminology consistent with RFP vocabulary map

### Step 4A — Establish Version Control for Draft Narratives [Enrichment C-002]

**Objective:** Establish a version control discipline for draft narratives before the review cycle begins, ensuring traceability of changes and protection of the master document.

**Actions:**

1. Establish a naming convention for draft files: `DEL-01-07_FirmProfile_v[MAJOR].[MINOR]_[YYYY-MM-DD].[ext]` (e.g., `DEL-01-07_FirmProfile_v1.0_2024-07-15.docx`).
2. Designate a storage location for all draft versions (project folder or document management system).
3. Identify the version controller (typically Proposal Manager) who controls the master draft and manages concurrent edits.
4. Enable change tracking in the working document before distributing for review.
5. Increment the minor version number for each review iteration (v1.0 = initial draft from Step 4; v1.1 = post-first review; v2.0 = major revision).
6. Archive each version (do not overwrite) so that changes can be traced if needed.

**Verification:**
- Naming convention documented and applied to initial draft
- Storage location confirmed and accessible to all reviewers
- Version controller identified
- Change tracking enabled

**Source:** Procedure.md Records table lists "Draft narratives (all versions with revision dates)" as a required record; this step operationalizes that requirement.

---

### Step 5 — Internal Review and Revision

**Objective:** Quality-assure the draft for accuracy, consistency, and scoring impact before PDF integration.

**Actions:**

1. Route draft to key reviewers (parallel if possible):
   - **Proposal Manager:** RFP 7.1.6 compliance; overall proposal messaging alignment
   - **Design Lead (Architect):** Technical accuracy and relevance statements for comparable projects
   - **Commercial Lead / Estimator:** Accuracy of budget figures, schedule outcomes, contract values
   - **Named team members in narrative:** Verify role descriptions and availability statements
   - **Business Development / Relationship Manager:** Validate client reference accuracy and current contact info
2. Consolidate feedback into a tracking log noting: factual corrections, relevance statement improvements, tone adjustments, length/space issues, and cross-document consistency items.
3. Revise narrative based on consolidated feedback:
   - Correct all factual errors immediately
   - Strengthen any weak relevance bridges
   - Ensure professional, factual, confident tone (per Guidance P-003)
   - Adjust length if over or under target
4. Cross-check DEL-01-07 against DEL-01-08 and DEL-01-09 (executes Specification V-09):
   - Every firm name in DEL-01-07 must match DEL-01-09 Appendix I -- compare exact spelling and legal form
   - Every named individual in DEL-01-07 project summaries (who is proposed for Penhold PSB) must appear in DEL-01-08 -- compare full names
   - Company names must be identical across all three deliverables
   - Role titles for named individuals must be consistent between DEL-01-07 and DEL-01-08
   - Document the result of each comparison; any mismatch triggers correction before proceeding to Step 6 [Enrichment X-001: explicit V-09 procedural anchoring; Specification.md Verification V-09]
5. Final proofread: grammar, spelling, table alignment, consistent formatting.

**Verification:**
- All factual claims verified against project records or confirmed by named team members
- Terminology consistent with RFP vocabulary map (Decomposition Section 5)
- Cross-document consistency confirmed with DEL-01-08 and DEL-01-09
- Tone: professional, specific, humble where appropriate — no unsupported superlatives
- No material ambiguities remain; TBD items are flagged with resolution owner and date

---

### Step 6 — Integration into Proposal PDF

**Objective:** Format the narrative for proposal Section 7.1.6 and deliver to PDF assembly (DEL-01-02).

**Actions:**

1. Apply proposal formatting standards (font, spacing, headings) consistent with rest of proposal document.
2. Confirm section placement: Section 7.1.6 within Section 7 (Project Delivery Plan), following section order per Constraint C-02.
3. Confirm tables and structured blocks are legible and visually consistent.
4. Coordinate with PDF assembly team (SOW-0001 / DEL-01-02):
   - Provide final narrative in agreed format (Word / formatted Markdown)
   - Confirm page count and position within Section 7
   - Verify client reference contact information is current in the version handed off
   - Flag any image-heavy elements that could affect PDF file size (total proposal must remain under 15 MB per Constraint C-01)
5. Quality check in assembled draft PDF:
   - All text is readable and correctly formatted
   - Page numbers and section headings are correct
   - Project summary blocks and reference tables are intact

**Verification:**
- Section 7.1.6 present at correct location in proposal PDF
- All formatting correct and readable in PDF
- File size contribution within allocation
- Handoff to PDF assembly documented

---

### Step 7 — Final Verification Before Submission

**Objective:** Confirm final accuracy of all project information and reference readiness immediately before proposal submission.

**Actions:**

1. Final contact with client references (1-2 weeks before submission deadline of August 30, 2024):
   - Confirm each reference remains willing and available to speak with Evaluation Committee
   - Confirm contact information in PDF is still current
   - Brief each reference on the Penhold PSB context and evaluation timeline
   - Document confirmation with brief email or call note
2. Spot-check project facts in final PDF against original project files for 1-2 key projects.
3. Confirm no last-minute changes to team availability that would create inconsistency with DEL-01-08.
4. Confirm no last-minute changes to Appendix I (DEL-01-09) that would create inconsistency with firm identification in DEL-01-07.
5. Document final verification in a checklist; obtain Proposal Manager sign-off.
6. Archive all supporting documentation (project files, reference confirmation emails, team availability records) in project records for potential post-submission follow-up or debrief.

**Verification:**
- All client references confirmed and briefed
- Project facts spot-checked and accurate
- DEL-01-07 / DEL-01-08 / DEL-01-09 cross-document consistency confirmed in final PDF
- Proposal Manager sign-off obtained
- Supporting documentation archived

## Contingencies

### Risk: Client Reference Becomes Unavailable
Contact references early in Step 3 (not just before submission). If a selected project's reference becomes unavailable, substitute with next-best project from Step 2 ranked list. Maintain at least one backup reference per selected project if possible.

### Risk: Key Team Member Not Available for Penhold PSB
If a named individual from a past project is not available to lead the same discipline for Penhold PSB, do not feature them as if they are. Instead, identify them as "Design Advisor" or "Principal Oversight" if they have an advisory role, and introduce the actual Penhold PSB lead. Ensure DEL-01-08 is updated to match.

### Risk: Past Project Had a Schedule or Budget Overrun
Address it transparently and briefly in the project summary (e.g., "A 3-week extension was required due to municipal permit hold; the team recovered one week through schedule optimization and delivered with client satisfaction"). Evaluators respect honesty; they distrust omission of known issues more than the issue itself.

### Risk: Firm Portfolio Does Not Include a True Combined Fire/Public Works Facility
Feature the closest comparable project (e.g., a fire hall plus a separate public works project), and write the relevance bridge to address how combined coordination will be managed. Acknowledge the Penhold PSB scope's combined nature directly in the firm overview. Do not claim combined experience if it doesn't exist.
