## Audit

All 72 cells across matrices C, F, D, K, X, and E were scanned for three failure patterns:

1. **Algebra leak** (contains special notation): PASS -- no cells contain intermediate algebra notation.
2. **Uninterpreted expansion** (exceeds ~80 characters): PASS -- all cell values are compact 2-4 word phrases.
3. **Operator leak** (contains `+` flanked by semantic terms): PASS -- no cells contain the addition operator as literal text.

**Cells requiring re-derivation:** 0
