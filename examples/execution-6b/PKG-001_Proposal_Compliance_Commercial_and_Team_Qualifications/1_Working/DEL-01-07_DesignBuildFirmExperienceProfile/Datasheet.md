## Attributes

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Document Format** | Narrative (prose + project summary tables/blocks) |
| **RFP Requirement (verbatim)** | "Design Builder to identify firms and subtrades and describe experience on similar projects." (RFP Section 7.1.6, p. 18) |
| **Proposal Section Placement** | Section 7.1.6 within Section 7 (Project Delivery Plan); must follow section order per RFP 4.3 / Constraint C-02 |
| **Anticipated Page Count** | TBD (no RFP page limit stated for this section; ASSUMPTION: 3-5 pages is appropriate for 3-5 project summaries at 0.5-0.75 pages each plus firm overview and track record statement). **Note:** Prior estimate of 2-4 pages reconciled upward -- Guidance C-003 estimates 3-5 project summaries at 0.5-1 page each (1.5-5 pages for summaries alone), and Guidance T-001 recommends 0.5-0.75 pages per summary. At 3-5 projects x 0.5-0.75 pages = 1.5-3.75 pages for summaries, plus firm ID and track record content, the total page budget is more realistically 3-5 pages. [Enrichment B-003: page count normalization; Guidance.md C-003; Guidance.md T-001] |
| **Audience** | RFP Evaluation Committee (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk, Willis, Third Party) |
| **Scope of Experience Required** | Design-Build projects on similar projects (RFP 7.1.6, verbatim); specifically comparable municipal facilities per decomposition context |
| **Facility Types (from decomposition)** | Fire halls, public works operations facilities, combined municipal services buildings (Decomposition: DEL-01-07 description) |
| **Minimum Project Count** | Not specified in RFP 7.1.6 (requirement is open-ended: "describe experience on similar projects") |
| **Reference Requirements** | Not explicitly specified in RFP 7.1.6; ASSUMPTION: client references are implied best practice for qualifications documents |
| **Project Recency** | Not specified in RFP 7.1.6; ASSUMPTION: projects from past 10-15 years are most relevant |
| **Scoring Approach** | Evaluated as part of 15-point "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" criterion; scored on Exceptional/Excellent/Very Good/Good/Fair/Acceptable/Unacceptable matrix (RFP Section 8.3, p. 27) |

## Conditions

### Compliance Conditions

| Condition | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **RFP Section 7.1.6 mandate** | RFP p. 18 | "Design Builder to identify firms and subtrades and describe experience on similar projects." -- full requirement text; confirmed verbatim |
| **Section order compliance** | RFP 4.3, Constraint C-02 | Narrative must appear within Section 7.1 in the required proposal section order |
| **PDF file size** | RFP 4.2, Constraint C-01 | Firm profile content contributes to overall proposal PDF; total must remain under 15 MB |
| **Coordination with Appendix I** | RFP 7.1.6; Decomposition | Section 7.1.6 directs "identify firms and subtrades" -- alignment with DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) is mandatory |
| **Team alignment** | Decomposition, DEL-01-08 | Named team members in firm profile must be consistent with DEL-01-08 key resumes |
| **Design-Build delivery relevance** | RFP context; CCDC 14-2013 per Appendix J | Comparable projects should demonstrate DB delivery capability; CCDC 14-2013 is the contract form for this project |

### Content Conditions

| Condition | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Experience on similar projects** | RFP 7.1.6 (verbatim) | "Similar projects" interpreted as comparable municipal facilities (fire halls, public works, combined services) per decomposition context |
| **Identify firms and subtrades** | RFP 7.1.6 (verbatim) | The narrative must identify firms (Design-Builder entity) and subtrades (coordinate with Appendix I); not just past clients |
| **No specific format prescribed** | RFP 7.1.6 | RFP does not prescribe project count, page limit, or table format for this section; Proponent has latitude in presentation |

## Construction

### Deliverable Content Structure (ASSUMPTION: inferred from RFP 7.1.6 requirement and OBJ-006 scoring context)

**ASSUMPTION:** The following structure is inferred from the requirement to "identify firms and subtrades and describe experience on similar projects" and the 15-point "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" evaluation weight under OBJ-006. [Enrichment E-001: label normalized to official RFP criterion name]

1. **Firm Identification**
   - Design-Builder entity: legal name, incorporation jurisdiction, years in business
   - Office locations / project delivery regions
   - Design-Build capability statement
   - Identification of key consultant firms and subtrades (coordination with DEL-01-09)

2. **Experience on Similar Projects**
   - Project summaries for comparable municipal facilities (fire halls, public works operations, combined services)
   - Per project: project name, location, client, completion date, contract value, delivery method, building type and scope, building size (square feet) [Enrichment B-001: building size added per Guidance P-003; cross-referenced to Specification R-04]
   - Per project: team roles (which named consultants / subtrades contributed)
   - Per project: delivery outcomes (schedule, budget, client satisfaction)
   - Per project: explicit relevance bridge to Penhold PSB scope

3. **Delivery Track Record** (ASSUMPTION: implied by OBJ-006 scoring language "strong team and firm experience")
   - Summary of on-time and within-budget delivery history
   - Claims/litigation history if applicable

4. **Client References** (ASSUMPTION: standard practice for qualifications sections; not explicitly required in RFP 7.1.6)
   - Client contact names, titles, phone, email for verifiable project references

### Anticipated Artifact

| Artifact | Description |
|---|---|
| Firm experience narrative | Prose + project summary blocks; 3-5 pages (ASSUMPTION, reconciled per Enrichment B-003); within proposal Section 7.1.6 |
