# Guidance: Design-Build Firm Experience Profile

## Purpose

DEL-01-07 fulfills RFP Section 7.1.6 ("Design Builder to identify firms and subtrades and describe experience on similar projects") and directly supports **OBJ-006: Demonstrate a strong team and firm experience** (15 points under "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" — tied for second-highest technical criterion, RFP Section 8.2, p. 26).

This deliverable is the Evaluation Committee's primary window into the firm's track record and proven ability to deliver comparable municipal facilities under a Design-Build arrangement. It works in combination with DEL-01-08 (key team resumes) and DEL-01-09 (Appendix I subtrade list) to paint a complete picture of team capability and relevant experience.

The scoring matrix (RFP Section 8.3, p. 27) rewards responses that "exceed expectations and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements that provides certainty of success." For this deliverable, certainty of success is demonstrated through evidence of comparable project delivery — specific projects, specific outcomes, and specific team members who delivered them.

## Principles

### P-001: Address Both Components of the RFP Requirement

**Principle:** RFP Section 7.1.6 has two explicit components: (1) identify firms and subtrades, and (2) describe experience on similar projects. Both must be present.

**Guidance:**
- Component 1 ("identify firms and subtrades"): Name the Design-Builder entity; name key consultant firms (architect, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical); name major subtrades. Coordinate with DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) so that firms named here appear in the Appendix I table.
- Component 2 ("describe experience on similar projects"): Provide concrete project summaries — not a generic capability statement, but named projects with outcomes.
- Do not allow the firm overview to substitute for project summaries, or project summaries to substitute for firm identification. Both must be present.

### P-002: "Similar Projects" Means Comparable Municipal Facilities

**Principle:** The RFP does not define "similar projects" in Section 7.1.6. The decomposition context (DEL-01-07 description) clarifies: relevant experience on comparable municipal facilities — fire halls, public works operations facilities, and combined services buildings — under a Design-Build delivery method.

**Guidance:**
- Prioritize projects with fire hall components, public works operations components, or combined municipal services.
- Design-Build delivery (CCDC 14-2013 or equivalent) is the strongest comparator. If Design-Bid-Build projects are used, acknowledge the difference and explain the team's relevant contribution. **Clarification on non-DB delivery projects:** A project delivered under Design-Bid-Build (or other non-DB method) qualifies as "similar" only if (a) the facility type is comparable (fire hall, public works, combined municipal services), AND (b) the narrative explicitly qualifies the delivery method difference with a statement of the team's relevant contribution under that delivery method. Non-DB projects should not constitute the majority of cited examples. [Enrichment A-001: prescriptive threshold for "similar projects" when delivery method differs; Datasheet.md CN-06; Guidance.md P-002]
- Projects in Alberta or western Canada carry the most relevance given the Owner's context (Alberta Building Code, municipal procurement norms, similar climate/construction environment). Projects elsewhere in Canada are acceptable; ASSUMPTION: North American projects with equivalent context are acceptable.
- Scale need not be identical; what matters is that the facility type and operational complexity are comparable (municipal operational facility with multiple user groups and specialized systems).

### P-003: Use Named, Verifiable Evidence — Not Generic Claims

**Principle:** The evaluation scoring matrix rewards "certainty of success" and "clear understanding of requirements." Generic claims ("We have extensive municipal experience") score poorly. Named projects with specific outcomes score well.

**Guidance:**
- Every capability claim should be anchored to a named project. "We delivered Springdale Fire Hall ($8.2M, 2019) on time and 3% under budget" is far stronger than "We typically deliver on time and within budget."
- Include building size (square footage), contract value, delivery date, and team roles for each project. These details allow the Evaluation Committee to verify the claim and assess comparability.
- If quantitative performance data (schedule %, budget %) is available from firm records, use it. If not, describe outcome qualitatively but honestly (e.g., "Delivered on schedule following a two-week delay caused by unexpected soil conditions; schedule recovery implemented through concurrent activities").
- Do not make claims that cannot be confirmed by the referenced client — the Evaluation Committee may contact references.

### P-004: Explicitly Connect Past Projects to Penhold PSB

**Principle:** The Evaluation Committee is scoring how well the firm's experience prepares them specifically to deliver Penhold PSB. The link between past projects and this project must be explicit in the narrative — it should not be left to the evaluator to infer.

**Guidance:**
- End each project summary with a "Relevance to Penhold PSB" statement: identify the specific similarity (facility type, mechanical systems, team roles, delivery method, operational complexity).
- Addendum 03 introduced several technically specific requirements (apparatus bay direct exhaust ventilation, bay sumps, backup generator for ICP/kitchen/bathrooms, 2" water fill stations, solar-capable roof orientation, 40 bunker gear lockers with room-level ventilation). If the firm has experience with any of these from past projects, call it out explicitly — it signals competence in operationally complex facilities.
- If a named key team member (architect, mechanical engineer, project manager) from a comparable project will lead the same discipline on Penhold PSB, say so. This ties experience directly to available capability.

### P-005: Coordinate with DEL-01-08 and DEL-01-09

**Principle:** The three qualifications deliverables (DEL-01-07 firm profile, DEL-01-08 key resumes, DEL-01-09 Appendix I) are evaluated together under the 15-point "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" criterion. Inconsistency between them undermines credibility. [Enrichment E-001: label normalized to official RFP criterion name]

**Guidance:**
- All firm names in DEL-01-07 must appear in DEL-01-09 Appendix I. If the architectural firm is named in the firm profile, it must be listed in Appendix I under its scope.
- All individual names cited in project summaries (e.g., "Design Architect Jane Smith") must appear in DEL-01-08 if they are proposed as key team members for Penhold PSB.
- Do not name a person as a key contributor on past projects and then omit them from DEL-01-08, unless they are no longer with the firm or available (in which case, clarify this).
- Cross-check terminology: the company name used in DEL-01-07 must exactly match the company name in DEL-01-09 and DEL-01-08.

## Considerations

### C-001: RFP Requirement is Brief — Latitude is an Opportunity

The full text of RFP Section 7.1.6 is a single sentence: "Design Builder to identify firms and subtrades and describe experience on similar projects." This brevity is an opportunity, not a limitation. The Proponent has latitude to present experience in the format most compelling to this Owner. A well-structured, visually clear narrative with specific project summaries will distinguish the proposal from one that provides a bare minimum response.

Source: RFP Section 7.1.6, p. 18 (verbatim text confirmed).

### C-002: Scoring Is Against Qualitative Bands, Not Checklist Items

The scoring matrix (RFP Section 8.3, p. 27) uses qualitative bands: Exceptional, Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Acceptable, Unacceptable. An "Exceptional" score (100%) requires a response that "exceeds expectations and demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirements that provides certainty of success and adds a level of innovation." This implies the firm profile should:
- Demonstrate genuine understanding of what Penhold PSB requires operationally (combined fire/public works, municipal context, 50-year design life, Addendum 03 special requirements)
- Provide evidence — not assertions — of capability to deliver it
- Potentially add an "innovative" element: this could be a process innovation (e.g., integrated design-build management system), a comparable project that mirrors Penhold PSB particularly closely, or demonstrable lessons-learned that improve delivery

**Rationale on "innovation" in a firm experience context:** The RFP scoring matrix's use of "adds a level of innovation" for the Exceptional band is ambiguous when applied to a backward-looking qualifications narrative. For a firm experience profile (unlike a design or methodology narrative), "innovation" should be interpreted as: (a) demonstrating a novel approach to DB delivery that improved outcomes (process innovation), (b) presenting lessons-learned from a comparable project that directly address a Penhold PSB challenge (applied learning), or (c) showing evidence of continuous improvement across multiple projects (trajectory of capability). It does **not** mean inventing or embellishing past project features. The drafter should not conflate innovation with mere comparability -- a closely mirroring project is strong evidence of capability, but it is not itself "innovation" unless the project involved a genuinely novel approach. [Enrichment F-002: rationale gap; Guidance.md C-002; RFP Section 8.3, p. 27]

### C-003: No Minimum Project Count or Page Limit

RFP Section 7.1.6 does not specify a minimum number of projects or a page limit for this section. ASSUMPTION: 3-5 project summaries at 0.5-1 page each is appropriate for the 15-point "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" criterion in a proposal targeting an "Excellent" to "Exceptional" score. [Enrichment E-001: label normalized] Fewer than 3 projects may be perceived as thin; more than 6 may consume disproportionate space. The goal is depth of evidence, not volume of projects.

### C-004: Combined Services Buildings Carry the Most Weight

The Town of Penhold is building a genuinely combined facility — fire hall and public works operations in one building, with shared spaces, shared site, and coordinated management. Experience with a true combined services facility (not just a standalone fire hall or standalone public works building) is the strongest comparator. If the firm has delivered a combined services building, feature it as the primary project example.

### C-005: Apparatus Bay and Specialized Systems Experience is Differentiating

Addendum 03 confirms several technically specific requirements that are not standard in office or commercial buildings: direct exhaust ventilation for fire apparatus bays (2 apparatus per bay), bay sumps for snow melting and washing, backup generator for ICP/kitchen/bathrooms/bay door secondary opening, 2" water fill stations (one fire bay, one PW bay), and 40 bunker gear lockers with room-level ventilation. A firm that has delivered projects with any of these systems demonstrates operational facility competence that a generalist firm cannot match. Document this experience explicitly if it exists.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Depth of Project Summaries vs. Proposal Page Budget

**Trade-off:** More detailed project summaries (1+ pages each) build credibility but consume proposal space and risk approaching the 15 MB PDF limit or making the proposal feel heavy. Shorter summaries (0.25 pages) preserve space but may not be convincing.

**Recommendation:** Target 0.5-0.75 pages per project summary. Each summary should include all key fields (name, client, type, value, date, team, outcome, relevance) in a structured format — project header + 3-4 short paragraphs. Structured blocks are more readable than dense prose. Aim for 3-5 projects total.

### T-002: Breadth of Portfolio vs. Comparability of Examples

**Trade-off:** A broad portfolio (many projects of varied types) demonstrates versatility but may dilute the "similar projects" message. A narrow portfolio (only fire halls) demonstrates specialization but may not demonstrate combined-services capability.

**Recommendation:** Lead with the most comparable project (ideally a combined fire/public works facility). Follow with a fire hall project, a public works or municipal operations project, and optionally one non-municipal project that demonstrates a specific technical capability (e.g., specialized exhaust ventilation system). Quality and comparability matter more than quantity.

### T-003: Named Individuals in Project Summaries vs. Team Availability Risk

**Trade-off:** Naming specific individuals (architect, engineers) in project summaries strengthens credibility by tying past success to named available team members. However, if those individuals are not available for Penhold PSB, the narrative creates an expectation that cannot be met.

**Recommendation:** Only name individuals in project summaries who are confirmed available for Penhold PSB and who will appear in DEL-01-08. If a past project's design architect has since retired or left the firm, do not feature them as a key name — instead, reference the firm's institutional knowledge and introduce the replacement.
