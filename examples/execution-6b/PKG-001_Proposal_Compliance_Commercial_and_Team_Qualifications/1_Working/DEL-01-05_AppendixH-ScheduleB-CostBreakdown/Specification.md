# Specification: DEL-01-05 — Appendix H — Schedule B — Cost Breakdown

---

## Scope

### What Schedule B Covers

Schedule B is the detailed, itemized cost breakdown supporting the Design-Build proposal. It provides cost transparency behind the summary pricing shown on Schedule A (DEL-01-04), breaking down all base contract costs and each of the six Additional Options into logical work categories and sub-items.

**In Scope:**

1. **General Requirements** — Design and Engineering (all disciplines), Bonding (Performance Bond 50% + Labour & Materials Bond 50%), CCIP Insurance, Project Management, Site Mobilization, General Conditions, and Contingency
2. **Public Services Buildings** — All structural, architectural, mechanical, electrical, specialty systems, and fit-out costs for the main combined Fire Hall + Public Works facility (including Cold Storage building); excluding pickled sand storage and all Additional Options
3. **Public Services Sitework** — Site grading, utility connections, storm drainage, parking, access roads, landscaping on the 12-acre developable site
4. **Additional Options 1–6** — Each separately priced and itemized:
   - Additional Option 1: Wash Bay Interior + Equipment
   - Additional Option 2: Yard Lighting
   - Additional Option 3: Access Control System
   - Additional Option 4: Security System + Monthly Monitoring Fee (monitoring shown as separate sub-line)
   - Additional Option 5: Signage
   - Additional Option 6: Appliances / FF&E ($20,000 cash allowance)

**Out of Scope:**

- Pickled Sand Storage building (removed per Addendum 03 §1.2 — separate future RFP; must not appear in Schedule B)
- Items procured or supplied directly by the Owner
- Post-construction O&M costs beyond the 12-month warranty period
- Solar photovoltaic panels (solar-ready roof provisions are in scope; actual solar panel installation is not)

## Requirements

### R-01: Complete Itemization

**Requirement:** Schedule B shall contain a complete, itemized breakdown of all costs included in the base contract and each Additional Option, with sufficient detail to verify consistency with Schedule A (DEL-01-04) totals.

**Source:** RFP §8; SOW-0006; C-05

**Verification:**
- Base contract subtotal on Schedule B = Schedule A line 1-1
- Each Additional Option total on Schedule B = corresponding Schedule A line (1-2 through 1-7)
- No unexplained gaps; all major scope elements from the Functional Program and Addendum 03 are reflected

**Evidence:** Completed Schedule B form with all cells populated, formulas verified, and zero blank cost cells.

---

### R-02: Structural Organization

**Requirement:** Schedule B shall be organized into the following primary cost categories, each with sub-items:

1. **General Requirements** (Design and Engineering, Bonding, CCIP Insurance, Project Management, Mobilization, Contingency)

3. **Public Services Sitework** (grading, utilities, drainage, parking, landscape, site fencing/gates)
4. **Additional Options 1–6** (each separately labeled and itemized)

**Note on Sitework sub-items:** Landscaping/Site Restoration (S-06) and Site Fencing/Gates (S-07) are included as **ASSUMPTION**-based cost lines in Datasheet Construction Section 3 and Procedure Step 3. They should be reflected in Schedule B Sitework unless the Estimator determines they are out of scope, in which case the exclusion must be documented in DEL-01-06.

**Source:** RFP §8; Appendix H template; SOW-0006

**Verification:** Form structure is labeled with the above primary categories and sub-items; section headings match template and RFP expectations.

**Evidence:** Schedule B form layout and section headings.

### R-06: Consistency with Schedule A (DEL-01-04)

**Requirement:** All totals on Schedule B shall reconcile exactly with the corresponding lines on Schedule A (DEL-01-04).

**Source:** _REFERENCES.md; SOW-0006; OBJ-007

**Canonical Schedule A Line Mapping (authoritative reference):**

| Schedule A Line | Schedule B Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Line 1-1** | Sections 1 + 2 + 3 subtotal | Base Contract (General Requirements + Buildings + Sitework) |
| **Line 1-2** | Additional Option 1 total | Wash Bay Interior + Equipment |
| **Line 1-3** | Additional Option 2 total | Yard Lighting |
| **Line 1-4** | Additional Option 3 total | Access Control |
| **Line 1-5** | Additional Option 4 total | Security System + Monthly Monitoring Fee |
| **Line 1-6** | Additional Option 5 total | Signage |
| **Line 1-7** | Additional Option 6 total | Appliances / FF&E ($20,000 cash allowance) |

**Verification:**
- Each Schedule B total matches the corresponding Schedule A line per the mapping table above (match to the nearest dollar)
- No rounding discrepancies; if minor differences exist, they are documented and justified in DEL-01-06
- This mapping table is the single canonical reference for line numbering; Datasheet, Procedure V-02, and all cross-references shall use this notation

**Evidence:** Side-by-side comparison of Schedule A and Schedule B totals (cross-check documented in DEL-01-06).

---

### R-07: Clarity and Defensibility

**Requirement:** Schedule B line items and cost allocations shall be descriptive, reasonable, and aligned with the Pricing Narrative assumptions provided in DEL-01-06.

**Source:** RFP §8; OBJ-007 (competitive, compliant, defensible pricing)

**Verification:**
- Line items are named descriptively (not generic labels like "Miscellaneous")
- Cost allocations align with the building program scope and known cost drivers
- Any unusual allocations or single large line items are explained in DEL-01-06
- Proponent assumptions (contingency percentage, allowances, exclusions) are consistent and documented

**Evidence:** Completed Schedule B + DEL-01-06 Pricing Narrative (cross-reference).

---

### R-08: Security Monitoring as Separate Sub-Line

**Requirement:** Within Additional Option 4 (Security System + Monthly Monitoring Fee), the monthly monitoring fee shall be shown as a distinct sub-line, separate from the installation cost.

**Source:** SOW-0006; Decomposition §9 DEL-01-05 description

**Verification:**
- Additional Option 4 contains at least two sub-lines: (A) Security System Installation; (B) Monthly Monitoring Fee
- Sub-line B specifies the term (e.g., 12 months) and monthly rate, or the total monitoring cost for the agreed period
- DEL-01-06 explains the monitoring term, renewal approach, and rate escalation assumptions

**Evidence:** Schedule B Additional Option 4 entry; cross-reference with DEL-01-06.

---

### R-09: Addendum Acknowledgement

**Requirement:** Appendix H shall include a completed addendum acknowledgement line confirming receipt and incorporation of Addenda 01, 02, and 03.

**Source:** RFP §2.9; C-07

**Verification:**
- Appendix H contains a line confirming: "Proponent acknowledges and has incorporated Addendum 01 (Jul 11, 2024), Addendum 02 (Jul 15, 2024), and Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024)"
- Line is signed, dated, or marked as completed by an authorized representative
- This line may appear on Schedule A header or as a dedicated section within Appendix H; if on Schedule A, it is referenced on Schedule B

**Placement clarification (TBD -- requires human ruling):** The current language permits the addendum acknowledgement to appear either on Schedule A or as a dedicated Appendix H section. If placed on Schedule A only, R-09 requires that Schedule B contain an explicit reference to the acknowledgement (e.g., "See Schedule A header"). The Proponent should confirm the placement approach before finalizing the Appendix H package.

**Evidence:** Appendix H addendum acknowledgement section.

---

### R-10: Tax Separation

**Requirement:** All taxes shall be shown separately from cost subtotals on Schedule B. Taxes shall not be embedded in unit costs or line-item amounts.

**Source:** RFP §8; RFP §8.2; Appendix H template; Datasheet Conditions ("Taxes shown separately")

**Verification:**
- Schedule B contains a clearly labeled tax line or section showing applicable taxes (e.g., GST) separate from all cost subtotals
- No individual line item embeds tax in its stated cost
- Tax treatment is consistent with the approach described in DEL-01-06

**Evidence:** Schedule B tax line(s); cross-reference with RFP §8 format requirements.
