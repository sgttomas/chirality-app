# Deliverable: DEL-01-05 Appendix H - Schedule B - Cost Breakdown

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to provide a transparent, itemized financial decomposition that demonstrates scope comprehension, cost defensibility, and pricing compliance for a design-build proposal. It translates the full scope of work -- base contract categories and separately-priced additional options -- into a structured cost breakdown that reconciles with summary pricing, reflects addenda impacts, and supports evaluation credibility. The knowledge it must carry spans mandatory cost structuring rules, compliant pricing treatments, and defensible allocation rationale.

- p3 = adequate worth * defensible rationale = "substantiated defense"
- p4 = adequate worth * adequate quality = "sufficient merit"

Step 3: Centroid of {warranted benchmark, proven quality, substantiated defense, sufficient merit} -> u = "Substantiated Quality"

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- "Resolved Merit Standard" * "Exhaustive Guidance Scope" = "total merit coverage"
- "Validated Worth" * "Comprehensive Delivery" = "complete value realization"
- "Decisive Justification" * "Exhaustive Adjudication" = "total justification"
- "Settled Quality Review" * "Exhaustive Audit Scope" = "complete quality audit"

L_E(evaluative, completeness) = {total merit coverage, complete value realization, total justification, complete quality audit}

**I(evaluative, completeness, L):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = "total worth"

Step 2:
- p1 = total worth * total merit coverage = "absolute value scope"
- p2 = total worth * complete value realization = "full merit delivery"
- p3 = total worth * total justification = "exhaustive rationale"
- p4 = total worth * complete quality audit = "comprehensive worth review"

Step 3: Centroid of {absolute value scope, full merit delivery, exhaustive rationale, comprehensive worth review} -> u = "Exhaustive Merit Scope"

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- "Resolved Merit Standard" * "Systematic Coherence" = "coherent merit"
- "Validated Worth" * "Reliable Implementation" = "dependable value"
- "Decisive Justification" * "Principled Adjudication" = "principled rationale"
- "Settled Quality Review" * "Regulated Review Standard" = "standardized quality"

L_E(evaluative, consistency) = {coherent merit, dependable value, principled rationale, standardized quality}

**I(evaluative, consistency, L):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = "uniform worth"

Step 2:
- p1 = uniform worth * coherent merit = "aligned value"
- p2 = uniform worth * dependable value = "reliable quality"
- p3 = uniform worth * principled rationale = "integrity basis"
- p4 = uniform worth * standardized quality = "calibrated standard"

Step 3: Centroid of {aligned value, reliable quality, integrity basis, calibrated standard} -> u = "Calibrated Quality Standard"
