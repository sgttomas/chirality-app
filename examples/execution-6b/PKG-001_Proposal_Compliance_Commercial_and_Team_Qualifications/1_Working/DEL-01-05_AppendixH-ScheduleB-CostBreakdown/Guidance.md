# Guidance: DEL-01-05 — Appendix H — Schedule B — Cost Breakdown

---

## Purpose

Schedule B exists to make the price proposal **credible, defensible, and transparent** to the evaluation committee. By breaking the base contract cost into logical work categories and sub-items, and separately pricing each of the six Additional Options, Schedule B demonstrates that:

1. The Proponent has understood the full scope and has not missed significant cost drivers
2. Each major work package (General Requirements, Buildings, Sitework) has been estimated by a qualified Estimator using real cost bases (labor, materials, subcontractor input, allowances)
3. The six Additional Options are genuine, independently priced alternatives that add value without undermining the base proposal
4. All addenda impacts — FF&E removed from base cost, Pickled Sand Storage excluded, CCIP insurance included, Addendum 03 program items costed — are properly reflected

Schedule B also serves as the **detailed backup** to Schedule A summary lines (DEL-01-04). Evaluators will use Schedule B to verify that the base contract total is not artificially low and that all scope has been accounted for. Price and schedule together represent 35 of 100 evaluation points — the highest single criterion weight.

**Source:** Decomposition §15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk); OBJ-007.

### Strategic Implication of the 35-Point Evaluation Weight

The 35-point Proposal Price criterion is the **highest single criterion weight** in the evaluation (out of 100 total points). This has direct implications for how Schedule B should be prepared:

1. **Transparency over concealment:** Because evaluators will scrutinize the cost breakdown closely, a transparent and well-organized Schedule B builds evaluator confidence. Artificially low pricing or unexplained allocations will raise red flags and may reduce the evaluator's confidence in the Proponent's understanding of scope.
2. **Completeness signals competence:** A Schedule B that accounts for all scope items (including Addendum 03 requirements) demonstrates thorough scope comprehension -- a quality evaluators associate with lower project risk and higher execution reliability.
3. **Competitive positioning requires balance:** The cost breakdown must be competitive without appearing unrealistic. Given the 35-point weight, even a moderate price difference can shift rankings. The Estimator should calibrate cost assumptions to be defensible and market-aligned, documenting the basis in DEL-01-06.
4. **Detail level should match evaluator expectations:** With the highest weighting, evaluators are more likely to conduct a detailed review of Schedule B. The recommended moderate detail level (per T-001) supports this scrutiny.

## Principles

### P-001: Completeness Within Scope

**Principle:** Schedule B must account for all costs necessary to deliver the base contract scope (combined Fire Hall + Public Works facility, Cold Storage building, site work on 12-acre developable site) and nothing more.

**Why This Matters:** Evaluators expect a complete cost picture. A base contract that appears artificially low — by hiding costs in contingency, inflating Additional Option prices, or omitting scope — raises red flags. Transparent completeness is more credible than a suspiciously low total, even if the total is higher than competitors'.

**How to Apply:**
- Estimate each major work category realistically using Alberta labor rates, material costs, and subcontractor market input
- If a cost driver is uncertain, show it as a labeled allowance and document the basis in DEL-01-06
- Contingency (if used) should be a separately labeled line at a defensible percentage (typically 5–10% for Design-Build with moderate site risk)

**Source:** RFP §8; OBJ-007.

---

### P-002: Logical Organization Aligned to Work Responsibility

**Principle:** Cost categories should align with scope of work responsibility and, where applicable, construction phase sequence. Each category should have a clear owning trade or discipline.

**Why This Matters:** Evaluators familiar with construction costs will look for logical organization. During construction, change orders are priced against Schedule B line items; clear organization prevents post-award disputes.

**How to Apply:**
- **General Requirements** → Design and Engineering, Project Management, bonding, CCIP insurance, site mobilization, temporary facilities, safety
- **Public Services Buildings** → Broken down by trade/system: structure, envelope, mechanical (including specialized systems), electrical, interior fit-out
- **Public Services Sitework** → Site prep, grading, utilities, drainage, parking, landscape
- **Each Additional Option** → Self-contained scope for that option only (wash bay interior, yard lighting, access control, security + monitoring, signage, FF&E allowance)

**Source:** RFP §8; Appendix H template structure.

---

### P-003: Visible Reflection of All Addendum 03 Requirements

**Principle:** Every special requirement introduced or clarified by Addendum 03 that has a cost impact must be visibly reflected in Schedule B — either as a separate line item or confirmed as included in a parent line with a note in DEL-01-06.

**Why This Matters:** Addendum 03 changed the project scope materially (removed Pickled Sand Storage, added sumps, fill stations, specific ventilation, generator scope, bunker gear lockers, solar-ready roof, etc.). If major addendum items are invisible in pricing, it signals the Proponent either missed them or is hiding costs.

**How to Apply (by requirement):**

| Addendum 03 Requirement | Recommended Schedule B Approach |
|---|---|
| Pickled Sand Storage excluded | Do not cost; confirm in DEL-01-06 |
| Bay sumps (snow melt, minor washing) | Cost in Buildings — Mechanical/Plumbing |
| 16 ft overhead doors (minimum) | Cost in Buildings — Envelope/Doors |
| Fire apparatus direct exhaust ventilation (2 per bay) | Cost in Buildings — Mechanical (separate line recommended) |
| PW bay general ventilation | Cost in Buildings — Mechanical |
| Backup generator (kitchen, ICP, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary) | Cost in Buildings — Mechanical or Electrical (separate line recommended) |
| Water fill stations (2" min, 1 fire bay, 1 PW bay) | Cost in Buildings — Plumbing |
| Solar-capable roofing (orientation + structural rough-in) | Cost in Buildings — Envelope/Roof |
| 40 bunker gear lockers | Cost in Buildings — Interior Fit-Out |
| Bunker gear room ventilation | Cost in Buildings — Mechanical |
| Site servicing cash allowance | Cost in Sitework — as explicitly labeled cash allowance |

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.2, §1.5–§1.8, §1.10–§1.11, §1.14, §1.16, §1.18.

---

### P-004: Transparent Treatment of Allowances and Exclusions

**Principle:** Any allowance, exclusion, or cost assumption must be labeled clearly in Schedule B and explained fully in DEL-01-06. Do not leave evaluators guessing.

**Why This Matters:** Allowances (site servicing cash allowance, FF&E $20,000, contingency) are legitimate tools, but only when visible. Unexplained exclusions invite post-award disputes. Transparent assumptions allow the Owner to validate and negotiate.

**How to Apply:**
- **FF&E (Additional Option 6):** Show as explicit line — "$20,000 cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.18; furniture, fixtures, and equipment — not included in base contract cost." Reference DEC-012 in notes.
- **Site Servicing Cash Allowance:** Show as a separate line in Sitework — "Site servicing utility tie-in cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.7; detailed quotes to be obtained upon award and utility department confirmation."
- **Contingency:** If included in base cost, show as a separate labeled line in General Requirements with percentage stated; explain basis in DEL-01-06.
- **Design and Engineering:** Show as a line item in General Requirements; explain in DEL-01-06 whether it covers preliminary design through 100% IFC package, and at what fee basis.

**Source:** RFP §8; Addendum 03 §1.7, §1.18; DEC-012.

---

### P-005: FF&E Must Not Appear in Base Contract Cost

**Principle:** FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) must be excluded from the base contract cost and shown only as Additional Option 6 for $20,000 cash allowance, per Addendum 03 §1.18 and DEC-012.

**Why This Matters:** The Owner explicitly directed this treatment via Addendum 03. Including FF&E in the base cost violates the addendum requirement and may disqualify or distort the proposal price. The $20,000 allowance gives the Owner a clear, optional procurement choice.

**How to Apply:**
- Do NOT cost any furniture, fixtures, or equipment in General Requirements, Buildings, or Sitework categories
- **Important distinction:** Bunker gear lockers (functional operational storage infrastructure) may be costed as part of Buildings — Interior Fit-Out; they are not FF&E per se. Clarify this distinction in DEL-01-06 to avoid confusion.
- Show Additional Option 6 as a single line: "$20,000 cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.18 — allocation of funds TBD post-award with Owner."
- Do NOT attempt to increase the $20,000 amount; it was confirmed at this level in DEC-012.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.18; DEC-012; C-11.

---

### P-006: CCIP Insurance and Bonding Must Be Transparent and Defensible

**Principle:** CCIP insurance costs and bonding costs must be included in Schedule B (General Requirements) and tied to supporting evidence in DEL-01-03 and DEL-01-06.

**Why This Matters:** Insurance and bonding are mandatory per RFP §5.3.1 and Appendix J. Their costs vary widely. Transparency prevents accusations of low-ball bidding or inadequate coverage. Post-award, the Owner will verify that the Proponent carries the required coverage.

**How to Apply:**
- **Bonding Costs:** Show as a line in General Requirements — "Performance Bond (50%) + Labour & Materials Payment Bond (50%)"; amount based on surety quote or estimate (TBD pending final contract price); link to DEL-01-03.
- **CCIP Insurance:** Show as a line in General Requirements — "CCIP Insurance — project liability, builder's risk, etc. per Appendix J"; amount per broker quote or estimate; link to DEL-01-03 for insurance approach statement.
- If actual quotes are not yet available, show as TBD with a note that amounts will be confirmed before submission; document this in DEL-01-06.

**Source:** RFP §5.3.1, §9.14; Appendix J; DEC-011.

---

### P-007: Schedule B Must Be Internally Consistent and Reconciled with Schedule A

**Principle:** Every Schedule B total must match the corresponding Schedule A line exactly. Mismatches signal arithmetic errors or manipulation and will damage proposal credibility.

**Why This Matters:** Schedule A is the pricing summary the Owner uses to rank proposals. Schedule B is the audit trail for Schedule A. Any mismatch — even a minor rounding difference — will be noticed and may require clarification or result in rejection.

**How to Apply:**
- Use linked formulas in a spreadsheet so Schedule B subtotals automatically feed Schedule A lines
- Before submission, print both forms side-by-side and verify each total matches
- Document the reconciliation approach in DEL-01-06 (e.g., "Schedule B and Schedule A are linked via formulas; all totals reconcile as of [date]")
- Run a final QA/QC check after any last-minute cost changes

**Source:** DEL-01-04; _REFERENCES.md; R-06 (Specification).

## Considerations

### C-001: Cost Estimation Approach

**Question:** How should costs be estimated for each category?

**Guidance:** Use a **bottom-up approach** (estimating individual work items, labor, materials, subcontractor input, then summing to the category total) rather than a top-down approach (starting with a target price and allocating it). Bottom-up is more defensible.

**Steps:**
1. Decompose the building program from the Functional Program (Appendix B) and Addendum 03 clarifications
2. For each major component, estimate: quantity/scope, unit cost, labor, contingency
3. Sum component costs by work category (General Requirements, Buildings, Sitework)
4. Review for reasonableness: Does the cost per sq ft align with Alberta market rates for comparable projects?
5. Compare against benchmarks (RS Means, Altus InSite, local contractor feedback, historical fire hall + PW data)

---

### C-002: Handling Unknowns and Risks

**Question:** What if a cost driver is unknown at this stage (e.g., final utility tie-in costs, geotechnical conditions post-award)?

**Guidance:**
- Use a **cash allowance** for unknowns that the Owner has explicitly permitted (site servicing per Addendum 03 §1.7)
- Use a **contingency line** in General Requirements for general design-Build risks
- Always state the assumption and basis in DEL-01-06
- Do not guess or inflate individual line items to cover uncertainty — it reduces transparency and the ability to adjust for scope changes

**Note:** Per DEC-013, no additional geotechnical investigation is budgeted. If site conditions post-award reveal unexpected issues, this is a known risk to be addressed through contingency and/or change order. Document this exposure in DEL-01-06.

**Source:** DEC-013; Addendum 03 §1.7.

---

### C-003: Pricing the Additional Options

**Question:** How should each of the six Additional Options be priced?

**Guidance:** Each Additional Option must be a **complete, standalone cost** — all labor, materials, overhead, and profit included. If the Owner selects an option, no additional cost outside the stated option price should be required for that scope.

| Option | Recommended Approach |
|---|---|
| Option 1: Wash Bay Interior + Equipment | Quote from mechanical/plumbing contractor; estimate $/sq ft for wet-area fit-out (500–800 sq ft wash area) plus equipment (high-pressure system, drain, controls) |
| Option 2: Yard Lighting | Quote from electrical contractor; or estimate per fixture (poles, fixtures, wiring, controls) |
| Option 3: Access Control | Quote from security/controls contractor; or estimate per controlled access point (card readers, locks, controller, wiring) |
| Option 4: Security System + Monitoring | Quote from security contractor; separate installation sub-line from monitoring sub-line; see C-004 below |
| Option 5: Signage | Quote from signage contractor; or estimate per sign type (monument, building ID, directional) |
| Option 6: FF&E | Fixed at $20,000 cash allowance per DEC-012; do not modify |

**Market Reasonableness Benchmarks (Directional -- Not Pass/Fail Thresholds):**

The following ranges are provided as directional benchmarks for the Estimator's reasonableness self-check. They are derived from Alberta market data for comparable municipal facilities and are used in Procedure V-04 as reference points. They are **not** normative pass/fail thresholds -- significant deviations are acceptable if justified and documented in DEL-01-06. See Conflict Table CT-001 for the authority-level question pending human ruling.

| Option | Typical Alberta Market Range (ASSUMPTION -- benchmark only) |
|---|---|
| Option 1: Wash Bay Interior + Equipment | TBD -- project-specific; depends on scope of wet-area finishes and equipment |
| Option 2: Yard Lighting | $30,000--$60,000 for a site of this scale |
| Option 3: Access Control | $30,000--$60,000 for 6--10 controlled access points |
| Option 4: Security System (installation) | $40,000--$80,000 (hardware, cabling, installation, commissioning) |
| Option 4: Security Monitoring (monthly) | $500--$750/month for 24/7 remote monitoring |
| Option 5: Signage | TBD -- project-specific; depends on sign types and quantities |
| Option 6: FF&E | Fixed at $20,000 (not a market-based estimate) |

**Source:** Procedure V-04 (Market Reasonableness); Alberta municipal construction benchmarks (**ASSUMPTION** -- ranges reflect general market conditions and should be validated against current-year cost data from RS Means, Altus InSite, or local contractor input).

### C-004: Handling Security Monitoring Fee (Additional Option 4)

**Question:** How should the monthly monitoring fee be presented on Schedule B?

**Guidance:** SOW-0006 and the decomposition's DEL-01-05 description explicitly require the monitoring fee to be a **separate sub-line** within Additional Option 4. The recommended format is:

- **Sub-line A:** Security System — Hardware, Installation, Commissioning: $TBD
- **Sub-line B:** Security Monitoring Service — 12-month contract at $TBD/month: $TBD

Clarify in DEL-01-06:
- The monitoring period covered in the proposal price (12 months is typical for proposal inclusion)
- Renewal terms and anticipated annual rate (provided as Owner information)
- Whether the monitoring is tied to any insurance or security requirements

**Source:** SOW-0006; Decomposition §9 DEL-01-05.

---

### C-006: Schedule B Formatting and Export

**Question:** Why does formatting matter for Schedule B, and how should format choices be made?

**Guidance:** Procedure Step 7 specifies detailed formatting requirements (minimum 10pt font, PDF export, page numbers, legible columns). These are not arbitrary -- they directly affect evaluator perception and compliance:

1. **Readability supports credibility:** A clearly formatted Schedule B signals professionalism. Evaluators reviewing detailed cost breakdowns under the 35-point Proposal Price criterion (the highest-weighted single criterion) will form impressions based on presentation quality. Cramped, illegible, or poorly organized cost tables undermine confidence in the underlying cost work.
2. **PDF format ensures fidelity:** Exporting to PDF prevents formula or formatting shifts that can occur when Excel files are opened in different software versions. The single-PDF submission requirement (C-01, 15 MB limit) means Schedule B must be embedded within the overall proposal PDF without separate attachments.
3. **Page layout for audit trail:** Including page numbers, proposal number, Proponent name, and date on each page creates a traceable audit trail. If evaluators print individual pages for side-by-side comparison with Schedule A, each page must be self-identifying.
4. **Column spacing for numerical review:** Cost columns should be right-aligned with consistent decimal precision (nearest dollar) so evaluators can quickly scan and verify totals.

**Source:** Procedure Step 7; C-01; RFP §4.2; Decomposition §15 (Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk -- 35-point weight).

---

### C-005: Bunker Gear Lockers vs. FF&E

**Question:** Do the 40 bunker gear lockers required by Addendum 03 §1.16 count as FF&E (and should they be in Additional Option 6)?

**Guidance:** Bunker gear lockers are **functional operational infrastructure** — permanently installed equipment specific to the fire apparatus function. They are analogous to fixed shelving or equipment storage racks, not furniture or general-purpose fixtures.

**Recommended treatment:** Cost bunker gear lockers in **Buildings — Interior Fit-Out** (base contract cost), NOT in Additional Option 6 (FF&E). Clearly state this interpretation in DEL-01-06 to pre-empt any ambiguity.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.16; C-11; DEC-012 (FF&E = office/operational furniture, not fixed operational equipment).

### C-007: Second Storey Option and Schedule B Impact

**Question:** If the Proponent's concept design includes a second storey for shared spaces (as permitted by Addendum 03), how should this affect Schedule B?

**Guidance:** Procedure Note 5 states that vertical transportation and structural costs must be reflected in Buildings costs if a second storey is included. However, the treatment on Schedule B requires careful consideration:

1. **Base contract approach (recommended):** If the Proponent's base design includes a second storey, the additional structural and vertical transportation costs should be embedded in the relevant Buildings sub-lines (B-01 Foundation/Structure, B-04 Mechanical Systems, B-09 Electrical). These costs should be called out in DEL-01-06 as design-driven cost elements.
2. **Alternate pricing scenario (if applicable):** If the second storey is presented as an optional design approach rather than the base design, the cost delta should be documented as a value alternative in DEL-01-06 per RFP §8.5, not as a separate Schedule B line. Schedule B should reflect only the base design configuration.
3. **Cost impact areas:** A second storey typically adds costs for: stairs (and potentially elevator for accessibility), structural reinforcement for multi-storey loading, fire separation between floors, additional HVAC zoning, and plumbing risers. These should be quantified by the design team and included in the appropriate Buildings sub-lines.

**TBD:** The specific cost treatment depends on whether the Proponent's concept design (PKG-002 deliverables) includes a second storey as the base configuration. This should be confirmed with the Design Lead before finalizing Schedule B.

**Source:** Procedure Note 5; Addendum 03 (second storey acceptable for shared spaces); RFP §8.5 (pricing alternatives).

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Detailed Itemization vs. Simplicity

**Trade-off:** Should Schedule B be highly detailed (20+ line items per category) or simpler (5–10 lines)?

**Rationale:**
- Detailed (more lines): More transparent; easier to audit; supports change order management post-award
- Simple (fewer lines): Easier to prepare; faster to present; but less defensible if questioned

**Recommendation:** Aim for **moderate detail**: 4–6 sub-items per main category (General Requirements, Buildings, Sitework), plus 6 Additional Option lines (with 2 sub-lines for Additional Option 4). This balance provides credibility without overwhelming the evaluator.

---

### T-002: Contingency Visibility

**Trade-off:** Should contingency be shown as a separate line or embedded in unit prices?

**Rationale:** Embedded contingency hides the risk posture and makes it impossible for the Owner to understand the proponent's confidence level. Separate contingency is more transparent and allows the Owner to evaluate risk management maturity.

**Recommendation:** Show contingency as a **separate labeled line** in General Requirements (e.g., "Project Contingency Reserve: 7% of base cost"). For this project's risk profile (known geotechnical report from 2021, Addendum 03 clarifications provided, Alberta market familiarity), 7% is the recommended starting point. Document the basis in DEL-01-06.

**Authority level note:** The 7% contingency is a **Guidance recommendation** (this document, T-002) and is used as a working value in Procedure Step 2. It is **not** a Specification requirement -- Specification R-01 and R-02 require contingency to be a separately labeled line but do not mandate a specific percentage. The Estimator may adjust the percentage based on project-specific risk assessment, provided the rationale is documented in DEL-01-06. This normalization clarifies that the 7% figure carries directional authority (Guidance), not normative authority (Specification).

**Source:** Guidance T-002; Procedure Step 2; Specification R-01, R-02 (contingency as labeled line); Datasheet GR-08.

---

### T-003: FF&E Allowance Adequacy

**Trade-off:** Is $20,000 adequate for FF&E for a combined Fire Hall + Public Works facility of approximately 19,000 sq ft?

**Rationale:** At $20,000 for the total building, this is approximately $1.05/sq ft — low for full fit-out but set as the fixed allowance amount per DEC-012 and Addendum 03. The intent is that the Owner will procure FF&E separately (or via this allowance as a starting point), not that the entire fit-out is included for $20K.

**Recommendation:** Accept the $20,000 as specified. Do not attempt to increase it; it was confirmed at this level by the Owner in Addendum 03. Note in DEL-01-06 that the allowance provides a starting budget for Owner-directed FF&E procurement, with detailed scope to be determined post-award.

**Source:** DEC-012; Addendum 03 §1.18.

---

### T-004: Lump-Sum vs. Unit-Based Pricing Within Categories

**Trade-off:** Should sub-items within Buildings and Sitework be lump-sum or unit-based (e.g., $/sq ft, $/linear ft)?

**Rationale:**
- Lump-sum: Simpler presentation; harder to audit; difficult to adjust for scope changes
- Unit-based: More transparent; easier to validate; allows scope adjustments post-award

**Recommendation:** Use a **hybrid approach**: Present totals by major category, but within Buildings, break down by sub-system (structure, envelope, mechanical, electrical, interior). This allows auditing without overwhelming detail. Full unit-cost breakdowns (the actual estimating worksheets) are retained internally and not submitted with the proposal.
