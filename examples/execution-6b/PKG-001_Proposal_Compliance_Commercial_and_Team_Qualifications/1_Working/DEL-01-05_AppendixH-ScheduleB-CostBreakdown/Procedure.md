# Procedure: DEL-01-05 — Appendix H — Schedule B — Cost Breakdown

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps to **produce a complete, credible, and compliant Schedule B cost breakdown** for the Penhold PSB Design-Build proposal. Schedule B is the detailed itemized breakdown of all base contract and Additional Option costs, and it must be prepared by the Estimator/Commercial Lead in coordination with design and construction team leads.

The completed Schedule B form, together with Schedule A (DEL-01-04) and the Pricing Narrative (DEL-01-06), constitutes the full financial proposal (Appendix H) required by RFP §4.3 and Constraint C-05.

   - Source: Addendum 03 document (integrated per SOW-0003)

5. **DEL-01-04 (Schedule A Pricing Summary)** — MUST BE COMPLETED FIRST
   - Schedule A line totals serve as reconciliation targets for Schedule B
   - Dependency: If Schedule A is not yet finalized, flag as a blocking dependency before beginning Steps 3 and 4

6. **Site Reference Reports** (from RFP Appendix D, E, F)
   - Geotechnical Investigation Report (2021) — foundation and site conditions basis per DEC-013
   - Site Grading (Appendix E) — grading volumes and site layout
   - Site Plan / Subdivision Plan (Appendix F) — 12-acre developable site dimensions
   - Wetland Assessment and Flood Zone mapping — site constraints
   - **Note:** No additional geotechnical investigation per DEC-013; all site-related estimates use the 2021 report as the sole basis

7. **Preliminary Design Assumptions**
   - Building footprint and gross floor area
   - Major system selections (structural system, HVAC type, electrical service size)
   - Site layout (parking, access roads, apparatus apron)
   - Source: Conceptual design (PKG-002 deliverables, if available) or Estimator's baseline assumptions
   - **ASSUMPTION:** At Schedule B preparation time, PKG-002 may not be finalized; Estimator uses reasonable assumptions and flags areas to be refined

8. **Subcontractor and Consultant Input** (if available)
   - Preliminary or budgetary quotes from major subtrades (structural, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, civil)
   - If detailed quotes are not available, use RS Means, Altus InSite, or local cost data as proxy; note source and date in DEL-01-06

9. **DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance Evidence)**
   - Provides the bonding and CCIP insurance cost basis for General Requirements lines
   - If broker quotes are not yet finalized, show as TBD and document in DEL-01-06

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather and Organize Scope Information

**Duration:** 1–2 days

**Action:**
1. Collect a copy of the RFP Functional Program (Appendix B) and create a **Scope Summary worksheet** listing:
   - Main building gross area (ASSUMPTION: approximately 19,000–22,000 sq ft based on Functional Program room areas; to be confirmed by Architect)
   - Cold Storage building: 60' × 100' = 6,000 sq ft (unheated per OSR)
   - Site area: 12-acre developable area
   - Major space categories: Fire apparatus bays, PW bays, administrative/office, shared spaces (ICP/meeting room, kitchen, bathrooms), residential quarters if applicable, mechanical/electrical rooms, storage

3. Review the **2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report** for:
   - Soil bearing capacity (affects foundation design and cost)
   - Fill requirements (affects sitework earthwork volumes)
   - Groundwater conditions (affects drainage and dewatering)
   - Identify any significant cost drivers (e.g., deep fill, specialized foundations, dewatering)

4. Review **Site Plan and Grading** for:
   - Proposed building footprint placement on 12-acre site
   - Grading cut/fill balance and retaining wall requirements
   - Utility connection points and estimated run lengths

5. **Deliverable:** Completed Scope Summary worksheet and Addendum 03 Requirements Checklist

**Verification:** All major scope items are identified; no Addendum 03 items are missed; Pickled Sand Storage is confirmed excluded.

---

### Step 2: Establish Cost Estimation Framework and Assumptions

**Duration:** 2–3 days

**Action:**
1. Establish the **Schedule B cost structure** in a spreadsheet template:
   - Section 1: General Requirements (sub-lines: Design and Engineering, Project Management, Site Mobilization, Bonding, CCIP Insurance, Safety, Contingency)
   - Section 2: Public Services Buildings (sub-lines: Foundation/Structure, Envelope/Roof/Doors, Mechanical, Electrical, Interior Fit-Out, specialty items per Addendum 03)
   - Section 3: Public Services Sitework (sub-lines: Clearing/Prep, Grading/Earthwork, Utilities/Servicing Allowance, Drainage, Parking/Access, Landscape)
   - Additional Options 1–6 (each as a standalone entry; Additional Option 4 has two sub-lines per R-08)

2. Define the **estimation approach** for each section:
   - **General Requirements:** Percentage-of-base-cost allocations (Design 7–10%, Project Mgmt 3–5%, Contingency 7%), plus actual quotes for bonding and insurance
   - **Public Services Buildings:** Bottom-up by sub-system using area-based or system-based unit costs; cross-check against comparable Alberta fire hall + PW project benchmarks (typical range: $250–$400/sq ft for combined facilities depending on finishes and systems)
   - **Public Services Sitework:** Unit-rate costing ($/cubic yard for grading, $/linear foot for utilities, $/sq yard for paving) plus cash allowances for unknowns per Addendum 03 §1.7
   - **Additional Options:** Standalone scope quotes or allowances per Guidance C-003

3. Record all **key assumptions** (will be detailed in DEL-01-06):
   - Base building area: __ sq ft (ASSUMPTION until Architect confirms)
   - Labor rates: $__ /hr general labor; $__ /hr specialty trades (Alberta market, current year)
   - Overhead and profit markup: __% overhead + __% profit (typical Design-Build: 15–20% overhead, 5–10% profit)
   - Contingency: 7% of base contract cost
   - Construction duration: __ months (affects overhead and labor duration costs)
   - Major cost risk areas: geotechnical (using 2021 report per DEC-013), utility tie-in costs (cash allowance per Addendum 03)

4. **Obtain preliminary quotes or ranges** from key subtrades:
   - Structural (foundation, frame)
   - Mechanical (HVAC, plumbing, generator, fill stations, ventilation systems)
   - Electrical (service, distribution, lighting, fire alarm, IT rough-in, transfer switching)
   - Civil/Sitework (grading, utilities, drainage, paving, landscape)
   - Security Contractor (CCTV system installation; monitoring rate) — for Additional Option 4

5. **Deliverable:** Completed Cost Estimation Framework document; preliminary subtrade input summary; key assumptions recorded for DEL-01-06

**Verification:** Estimation approach is documented; cost assumptions are reasonable per Alberta market; all key cost drivers are identified.

### Step 3: Populate Schedule B — Base Contract Costs

**Duration:** 3–5 days (iterative with Step 2)

**Prerequisite Verification Gate:** Before beginning cost population, the Estimator shall confirm the availability status of all required inputs listed in the Prerequisites section. Complete the following checklist and record results in the internal cost estimation worksheet:

- [ ] RFP Section 8 — available and reviewed
- [ ] Appendix H Template — available and reviewed
- [ ] RFP Functional Program (Appendix B) — available and reviewed
- [ ] Addendum 03 — available and reviewed; Addendum 03 Requirements Checklist (Step 1) completed
- [ ] DEL-01-04 (Schedule A) — finalized **OR** flagged as blocking dependency with estimated availability date
- [ ] Site Reference Reports (Appendix D, E, F; 2021 Geotechnical Report) — available and reviewed
- [ ] Preliminary Design Assumptions — documented (from PKG-002 or Estimator baseline); areas of uncertainty flagged
- [ ] Subcontractor and Consultant Input — obtained **OR** proxy data source identified (RS Means, Altus InSite, historical data) with source and date noted
- [ ] DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance Evidence) — available **OR** placeholder amounts identified with documentation plan in DEL-01-06

**Proceed/Hold Decision:** If DEL-01-04 (Schedule A) is not available, **do not proceed** with Step 3 -- this is a blocking dependency. For all other inputs, the Estimator may proceed using documented assumptions and proxy data, provided each unavailable input is recorded as TBD with a plan for resolution noted in DEL-01-06.

**Action:**
1. **Start with Schedule A (DEL-01-04) Base Contract total** as the reconciliation target for the sum of Sections 1, 2, and 3.

2. **Populate General Requirements (Section 1):**
   - Design and Engineering: obtain estimate from design team or apply 8–10% of building construction cost
   - Project Management and Supervision: 3–5% of contract value
   - Site Mobilization and Temporary Facilities: estimate per construction methodology (typical $50–100k for this scale)
   - Bonding (Performance Bond 50% + L&M Bond 50%): request quote from surety; or apply 1–2% of contract value as placeholder
   - CCIP Insurance: request quote from broker per Appendix J coverage requirements; or apply 1.5–2% of contract value as placeholder (linked to DEL-01-03)
   - Site Safety and OH&S: estimate per Alberta OH&S Prime Contractor requirements
   - Project Contingency Reserve: 7% of total base contract cost (Section 1 + 2 + 3 subtotal before contingency)

3. **Populate Public Services Buildings (Section 2):**
   - Foundation and Structural System: bottom-up from structural engineer input or apply $/sq ft benchmark; separately include sump construction cost (concrete pits in all bays per Addendum 03 §1.6)
   - Building Envelope (walls, roofing, windows): apply $/sq ft; include solar-capable roofing structural and electrical rough-in premium per Addendum 03 §1.14
   - Overhead Doors: price per door (16 ft minimum height per Addendum 03 §1.5; number TBD from architectural design); include heavy-duty hardware for fire and PW apparatus bays
   - Mechanical Systems: HVAC (zone breakdown: office, bays, shared spaces); plumbing (domestic water, sewer, sumps, fill stations); fire protection; generator; water fill stations (2" min, 1 fire + 1 PW per Addendum 03 §1.11)
   - Fire Apparatus Bay Direct Exhaust Ventilation: dedicated line for the specialized exhaust ventilation system serving 2 apparatus per bay per Addendum 03 §1.8
   - Bunker Gear Room Ventilation: separate line per Addendum 03 §1.16
   - Backup Generator: separate line showing scope (diesel standby unit, fuel tank, automatic transfer switch; loads = kitchen + ICP/meeting room + 2 bathrooms + bay door secondary opening per Addendum 03 §1.10)
   - Electrical Systems: service, distribution, LED lighting, fire alarm, controls, transfer switching (linked to generator), IT and telecom rough-in
   - Interior Fit-Out: drywall, flooring, ceilings, interior doors, paint, hardware; includes 40 bunker gear lockers as fixed operational equipment per Addendum 03 §1.16 (not FF&E)
   - Cold Storage Building (60' × 100' unheated): all trades for unheated equipment storage; slab-on-grade, structure, envelope, basic electrical

4. **Populate Public Services Sitework (Section 3):**
   - Site clearing and preparation
   - Earthworks and grading (estimate cut/fill from site grading plan; include compaction)
   - Site servicing utility tie-ins: **explicitly labeled cash allowance** per Addendum 03 §1.7 (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electrical, gas connections)
   - Storm drainage and stormwater management (coordinate with 12-acre site plan and flood zone context)
   - Paving: parking areas, vehicular access roads, fire apparatus apron
   - Landscaping and site restoration
   - Site fencing and gates (ASSUMPTION: required for operational security)

5. **Reconcile** Section 1 + 2 + 3 against Schedule A line 1-1 target:
   - If sum is below target: Review for overlooked items or increase contingency within justified range
   - If sum is above target: Review for over-counting; reduce contingency if justified; or accept higher base price and ensure it is competitively positioned

6. **Deliverable:** Draft Schedule B with base contract costs populated; base contract subtotal (Sections 1+2+3) reconciled to Schedule A line 1-1.

**Verification:** Base contract subtotal = Schedule A line 1-1; all Addendum 03 requirements are reflected in cost lines; no Pickled Sand Storage line exists.

---

### Step 4: Populate Schedule B — Additional Options 1–6

**Duration:** 2–3 days

**Action:**
1. For **each Additional Option**, price as a standalone, complete cost (labor + materials + overhead + profit):

   | Option | Key Scope Elements | Pricing Approach |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Option 1: Wash Bay Interior + Equipment** | Wet-area floor, drain, walls, ceiling; high-pressure wash system; dedicated plumbing and electrical; ventilation for wet conditions | Quote from mechanical/plumbing/electrical contractor; or estimate $/sq ft for 500–800 sq ft wet area |
   | **Option 2: Yard Lighting** | Parking and site lighting poles, LED fixtures, wiring, conduit, photocell/timer controls | Quote from electrical contractor; or estimate per fixture count (number of poles × installed cost per pole) |
   | **Option 3: Access Control** | Card/fob readers, electronic locks, control panel, wiring, integration; per controlled access point | Quote from security/controls contractor; or estimate per entry point × installed cost |
   | **Option 4: Security System + Monitoring** | See sub-line breakdown below | See Step 4, item 2 |
   | **Option 5: Signage** | Building identification (monument, building-mounted), directional signs, regulatory signage | Quote from signage contractor; or estimate per sign type and count |
   | **Option 6: FF&E** | $20,000 cash allowance per DEC-012 and Addendum 03 §1.18 | **Fixed at $20,000 — do not change** |

2. **Special handling for Option 4 (Security System + Monitoring):**

   Additional Option 4 must be broken into **two sub-lines** per R-08 and SOW-0006:

   - **Sub-line A:** Security System Installation — CCTV cameras, digital video recorders, cabling, installation labor, commissioning and testing: $TBD
   - **Sub-line B:** Security Monitoring Service — 12-month contract at $TBD/month: $TBD
   - **Additional Option 4 Total = Sub-line A + Sub-line B**

   In DEL-01-06, explain:
   - Camera count and placement assumptions (based on preliminary layout; final count in detailed design)
   - Monitoring term included in proposal price (12 months recommended)
   - Ongoing annual monitoring rate (for Owner's O&M planning)
   - No Town preference on security/camera suppliers (per Addendum 03)

3. **Verify each Option total matches the corresponding Schedule A line:**
   - Option 1 total = Schedule A line 1-2
   - Option 2 total = Schedule A line 1-3
   - Option 3 total = Schedule A line 1-4
   - Option 4 total = Schedule A line 1-5
   - Option 5 total = Schedule A line 1-6
   - Option 6 total = Schedule A line 1-7 ($20,000)

4. **Deliverable:** Complete Schedule B with all Additional Options priced and totals reconciled to Schedule A lines 1-2 through 1-7.

**Verification:** Each Additional Option total matches the corresponding Schedule A line; Additional Option 4 has two visible sub-lines; Additional Option 6 = $20,000 (exact).

---

### Step 5: Add Notes, Clarifications, and QA/QC

**Duration:** 1–2 days

**Action:**
1. **Add notes to Schedule B** for non-obvious or compliance-critical line items:
   - Backup Generator: note the loads served (kitchen, ICP/meeting room, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening per Addendum 03 §1.10)
   - CCIP Insurance: note coverage type and reference to Appendix J; note if amount is a premium estimate pending broker confirmation
   - Site Servicing Cash Allowance: note "Per Addendum 03 §1.7; detailed utility tie-in quotes to be confirmed upon award"
   - FF&E (Additional Option 6): note "$20,000 cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.18 — allocation TBD post-award with Owner; NOT in base contract cost"
   - Bunker Gear Lockers (if in Interior Fit-Out): note "40 lockers per Addendum 03 §1.16; classified as fixed operational infrastructure, not FF&E"

2. **Add Addendum Acknowledgement line** to Appendix H (if not already on Schedule A):
   - Text: "Proponent acknowledges and has incorporated into this proposal Addendum 01 (July 11, 2024), Addendum 02 (July 15, 2024), and Addendum 03 (July 31, 2024)."
   - Must be signed or authorized by a representative with authority to bind the Proponent

3. **QA/QC Check (Estimator):**
   - [ ] All formula cells are calculating correctly — no hard-coded totals
   - [ ] No blank cost cells (use $0 or "N/A" where not applicable — never leave blank)
   - [ ] Decimal precision is consistent (nearest dollar is acceptable for a construction estimate)
   - [ ] No Pickled Sand Storage line item exists anywhere in Schedule B
   - [ ] FF&E appears only as Additional Option 6 = $20,000 (not in base cost categories)
   - [ ] Security monitoring is a separate sub-line within Additional Option 4
   - [ ] All six Additional Options are present

4. **Obtain Finance / Controller sign-off:**
   - Confirm overhead rates, profit margins, and tax treatment are correct
   - Confirm bonding and CCIP insurance costs are defensible per DEL-01-03

5. **Deliverable:** QA/QC-verified Schedule B with notes and Addendum Acknowledgement; ready for final review and formatting.

**Verification:** All QA/QC checklist items pass; Finance has reviewed and approved cost structure; no outstanding formula or compliance issues.

---

### Step 6: Prepare Supporting Documentation (DEL-01-06)

**Duration:** 2–3 days (may run parallel with Steps 4–5)

**Action:**
1. **Prepare DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions)** to explain Schedule B in detail:
   - **Cost Estimation Approach:** Describe the methodology (bottom-up for Buildings, percentage-of-base for General Requirements, unit-rate for Sitework, allowances for unknowns)
   - **Addendum 03 Impacts:** Explicitly address each requirement and its cost treatment:
     - Pickled Sand Storage: excluded; no cost in Schedule B; confirmed separate future RFP
     - FF&E: removed from base cost; offered as Additional Option 6 ($20,000 cash allowance per DEC-012)
     - Sumps: included in Mechanical/Plumbing sub-line of Buildings
     - 16 ft overhead doors: included in Buildings Envelope/Doors sub-line (premium over standard doors noted)

     - 40 bunker gear lockers: included in Buildings Interior Fit-Out (not FF&E); ventilation included in Mechanical
     - Site servicing: cash allowance in Sitework per Addendum 03 §1.7; rationale for allowance amount
   - **Key Assumptions:** Base building area, labor rates, overhead/profit markup, contingency percentage and basis, schedule duration assumed, geotech basis (2021 report per DEC-013)
   - **Allowances and Exclusions:** List all cash allowances (site servicing, FF&E) and exclusions (Pickled Sand Storage; no additional geotechnical investigation per DEC-013)
   - **Insurance and Bonding:** Confirm CCIP approach per DEC-011; summarize coverage per Appendix J; reference DEL-01-03 for actual bonding document
   - **Schedule B Reconciliation Table:** Side-by-side showing Schedule B category totals = Schedule A summary lines

2. **Document value alternatives** (SOW-0031 per DEL-01-06 scope):
   - List any cost optimization ideas (phased delivery, value-engineering alternatives, alternate materials)
   - Show cost delta from base contract
   - Confirm these do NOT change the base contract price

3. **Deliverable:** Complete DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions) supporting all Schedule B cost entries; value alternatives listed separately.

**Verification:** All Schedule B assumptions are explained; all Addendum 03 impacts are addressed; reconciliation is clear; DEL-01-06 is internally consistent with Schedule B entries.

---

### Step 7: Format, Final Review, and Freeze

**Duration:** 1 day

**Action:**
1. **Format Schedule B for submission:**
   - Export from spreadsheet to PDF (preferred per RFP single-PDF requirement per C-01) or leave as Excel if template requires
   - Font size: minimum 10 pt; columns properly spaced; readable when printed or viewed on screen
   - Include: document title ("Appendix H — Schedule B — Cost Breakdown"), proposal number, Proponent name, date, page numbers
   - Verify all text and numbers are legible in the exported PDF

2. **Compile the Appendix H Package:**
   - Schedule A (DEL-01-04) — Pricing Summary
   - Schedule B (DEL-01-05) — Cost Breakdown (this deliverable)
   - Addendum Acknowledgement (signed/dated)
   - Any supplementary notes or schedules
   - **Note:** All components must be included within the single proposal PDF under 15 MB per C-01

3. **Final Three-Party Review:**
   - **Estimator:** Sanity check all costs for market reasonableness (cost per sq ft, major system costs)
   - **Commercial Lead:** Compliance check against RFP §8, Addendum 03 requirements, and Constraints C-05, C-07, C-10, C-11, C-12
   - **Project Manager:** Alignment check — does the pricing support the overall proposal strategy and competitive positioning?

4. **Obtain approvals:**
   - Estimator sign-off: cost estimates are complete and reasonable
   - Commercial Lead sign-off: Schedule B is complete and RFP-compliant
   - Project Manager sign-off: pricing aligns with proposal strategy

5. **Freeze Schedule B:**
   - No changes permitted after freeze except by joint approval from Commercial Lead and Project Manager
   - Record freeze date and approver names in the internal cost estimation worksheet

6. **Post-Freeze Re-Reconciliation Protocol (if Schedule B must be reopened):**
   - If Schedule A (DEL-01-04) is revised after Schedule B freeze, or if any other change requires Schedule B to be reopened (see Note 1), the following re-reconciliation steps apply:
     1. Commercial Lead and Project Manager jointly authorize reopening in writing (email or project log entry) stating the reason and scope of change
     2. Estimator identifies all affected Schedule B line items and documents the previous frozen values
     3. Estimator updates affected line items and recalculates all subtotals and the base contract total
     4. Estimator re-runs V-02 (Totals Reconciliation) to confirm Schedule B totals match the revised Schedule A lines
     5. Estimator re-runs V-03 (Compliance Check) to confirm no compliance items were disturbed by the change
     6. Commercial Lead and Project Manager re-approve and re-freeze Schedule B
     7. Record the reopening date, change description, previous and revised values, and re-freeze date in the internal cost estimation worksheet
   - **Important:** Re-reconciliation must also verify that DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative) is updated to reflect any changed assumptions or cost allocations

7. **Deliverable:** Final, formatted, approved Schedule B (PDF) and complete Appendix H package, ready for incorporation into the proposal PDF assembly (SOW-0001 / DEL-01-02).

**Verification:** Format is clear and compliant; all three-party approvals are obtained; document is frozen; no outstanding QA issues.

### V-04: Market Reasonableness

**Check:** Cost estimates are defensible per Alberta market rates and comparable projects.

**Verification Method:**
1. Calculate total Buildings cost per sq ft: divide Section 2 subtotal by gross building area
   - ASSUMPTION: Reasonable range for a Design-Build combined Fire Hall + Public Works facility in Alberta is approximately $250–$400/sq ft; verify against RS Means or Altus InSite current year data
2. Review major systems for reasonableness:
   - HVAC: typical $15–25/sq ft for complex mixed-use
   - Electrical: typical $15–25/sq ft for municipal facilities
   - Generator (diesel standby, 80–150 kW for stated loads): typical $40–80k installed
   - Backup exhaust ventilation (direct exhaust per bay): typical $30–70k per 2-apparatus bay system
3. Review Additional Options for reasonableness:
   - Yard lighting: typical $30–60k for a site of this scale
   - Access control: typical $30–60k for 6–10 controlled points
   - Security system + monitoring: typical $40–80k installation + $500–750/month monitoring

**Note on benchmark authority:** The dollar ranges listed above are directional benchmarks (**ASSUMPTION** -- Alberta market data for comparable municipal facilities), not normative pass/fail thresholds. These same ranges are documented in Guidance C-003 (Market Reasonableness Benchmarks). Significant deviations from these ranges are acceptable if justified and documented in DEL-01-06. See Guidance Conflict Table CT-001 for the pending human ruling on authority level.

**Pass Condition:** Cost per sq ft and major components fall within expected ranges; significant outliers are documented and justified in DEL-01-06.

### V-05: Consistency with Pricing Narrative

**Check:** Schedule B costs align with assumptions and explanations in DEL-01-06.

**Verification Method:**
- Read DEL-01-06 assumptions and trace each to a Schedule B line item
- Verify that all allowances or contingencies mentioned in DEL-01-06 are visible in Schedule B
- Confirm that Addendum 03 impacts explained in DEL-01-06 match the cost allocations in Schedule B
- Confirm that bunker gear locker treatment is consistent (Interior Fit-Out in Schedule B; explained as operational infrastructure, not FF&E, in DEL-01-06)

**Pass Condition:** No contradictions or unexplained gaps between Schedule B and DEL-01-06.

## Notes

1. **Dependency on Schedule A:** Schedule B cannot be finalized until Schedule A (DEL-01-04) totals are established. If Schedule A is revised post-freeze, Schedule B must be reopened and reconciled.

2. **Geotechnical Risk:** All sitework and foundation costs are based on the 2021 geotechnical report (per DEC-013). No allowance for additional geotechnical investigation has been included. If post-award investigation reveals unexpected conditions, this becomes a change order risk. Document this exposure explicitly in DEL-01-06.

3. **Solar-Ready Roofing Cost:** Addendum 03 §1.14 requires solar-capable roofing (appropriate orientation and structural/electrical rough-in). This cost is included in the base contract (Buildings — Envelope/Roof). Actual solar PV panels are not in scope and should not be costed unless included as a value alternative in DEL-01-06.

4. **CCIP vs. OCIP:** Per DEC-011, insurance is CCIP (Contractor Controlled). If the Owner later requires OCIP (Owner Controlled), this would be a contract scope change. Do not price OCIP in Schedule B.

5. **Second Storey Option:** Addendum 03 notes that a second storey is acceptable for shared spaces. If the Proponent's concept design includes a second storey, the vertical transportation (stairs, potential elevator) and structural costs must be reflected in Buildings costs.
