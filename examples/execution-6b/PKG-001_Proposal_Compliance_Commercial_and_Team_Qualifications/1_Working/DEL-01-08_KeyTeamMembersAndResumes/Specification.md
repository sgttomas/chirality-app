## Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Source | Verification Method |
|----|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **R-01** | Identify all key members of the Design-Build team | RFP §7.1.7 | Summary table review: confirms all key design and construction positions are named |
| **R-02** | Provide a resume for each key team member; each resume must not exceed 2 pages. Non-compliance: resumes exceeding 2 pages shall be condensed prior to submission; any resume exceeding the limit at time of submission risks being perceived as non-compliant by the Evaluation Committee (Source: RFP §7.1.7 explicit limit; consequence framing per Guidance P-003 / T-005) | RFP §7.1.7 (explicit) | Page count audit: each resume ≤ 2 pages; no exceptions |
| **R-03** | Resumes must highlight relevant experience | RFP §7.1.7 (explicit) | Content review: each resume references comparable projects (municipal facilities, design-build delivery, or discipline-specific equivalents) |
| **R-04** | Include personnel covering all major design and construction disciplines (architecture, civil, structural, MEP, construction management) | **ASSUMPTION:** Inferred from RFP §7.1.7 context and OBJ-006 scoring criteria; RFP does not enumerate specific disciplines | Team composition review: discipline coverage matrix |
| **R-05** | Include professional credentials (licenses, designations) for each key member, where applicable | **ASSUMPTION:** Implied by "relevant experience" language in §7.1.7 and industry standard for design-build proposals | Resume content review: credentials listed with registration entities |
| **R-06** | Availability and commitment statements for key personnel (indicating availability for project duration). **Authority level: RECOMMENDED (not mandatory).** | **ASSUMPTION:** Not explicitly stated in RFP §7.1.7; considered best practice for OBJ-006 scoring confidence. RFP does not require availability statements; however, the Exceptional scoring band (§8.3) rewards "certainty of success," which this supports. Treat as RECOMMENDED unless Owner confirms as mandatory. | Statement review: commitment dated within 30 days of submission |
| **R-07** | All resumes and the summary table must be included within the single proposal PDF (under 15 MB) | RFP §4.2 (submission format constraint) | PDF structure validation: file size check; all text searchable |
| **R-08** | Team member names, roles, and companies must be consistent between this deliverable and Appendix I (DEL-01-09) | RFP §4.3 (Appendix I requirement); cross-reference consistency rule | Cross-document consistency matrix: no conflicts between DEL-01-08 summary table and DEL-01-09 entries |

## Standards

| Standard / Reference | Applicability | Authority Level |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **RFP §7.1.7** | Direct requirement for key member identification and resume format | Primary authority |
| **RFP §8.2–8.3** | Scoring criteria: Project Team and Firms = 15 pts; 7-level rubric | Evaluation authority |
| **RFP §4.2** | Single PDF under 15 MB; submission format | Mandatory constraint |
| **RFP §4.3** | Proposal content order; Appendix I (subtrades/consultants) structure | Mandatory constraint |
| **CCDC 14-2013** | Design-Build delivery model; frames team competency expectations | Informative context |
| **Industry Best Practice** | 2-page resume standard; emphasis on relevant project experience for proposal submissions | Informative |

---

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification Method | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **R-01** | Personnel list audit against team composition | All key design and construction positions identified and named; no major discipline gaps |
| **R-02** | Page count audit (per resume) | Every individual resume is ≤ 2 pages; no exceptions permitted |
| **R-03** | Experience content review | Each resume references at least 3 projects relevant to the role; "relevant" means: (a) municipal or public-sector client, (b) comparable facility type (fire hall, public works, combined civic), or (c) design-build delivery method. TBD: define minimum threshold for project comparability (e.g., minimum project value, minimum gross floor area, or minimum years in discipline). Project type, size, or delivery method comparable to Penhold PSB context. (Source: Specification R-03; see Conflict Table entry CT-001 re: "at least 3" vs. "3-5" range) |
| **R-04** | Discipline coverage matrix | Disciplines represented: Architecture, Civil, Structural, MEP, Construction Management / Project Management; additional specialists as warranted |
| **R-05** | Credentials checklist | Professional licenses/certifications listed; registration entity (e.g., APEGA, AIBC) named; no expired credentials without renewal note. Additionally, verify that listed credentials are relevant to the proposed discipline role (e.g., structural P.Eng. for structural lead, not a different discipline P.Eng. filling a structural role). (Source: Guidance P-004 "Relevant to the specific role claimed") |
| **R-06** | Commitment statement collection | Signed statement for each key member dated within 30 days of submission; states project availability and role |
| **R-07** | PDF compliance check | Proposal PDF ≤ 15 MB total; resumes are searchable text (not scanned images); no broken links |
| **R-08** | Appendix I cross-reference audit | Names, roles, and companies match between DEL-01-08 summary and DEL-01-09 entries; no conflicts or gaps |

   - Format: Consistent proposal style (font, margins, headers per proposal template)
   - Content: Education, professional licenses/designations, work experience (5–10 years), 3–5 relevant project examples with role descriptions, professional affiliations
   - Compiled in order: Design-Builder leadership → Consulting team (by discipline) → Key subtrade leads

3. **Availability / Commitment Statements** (**ASSUMPTION:** recommended best practice)
   - Format: Signed letter or attestation form per key team member
   - Content: Commitment to Penhold PSB project; availability for full project duration; proposed role and responsibilities; dated within 30 days of submission

4. **Cross-Reference Alignment Matrix** (internal control document)
   - Links DEL-01-08 key personnel names to DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) entries
   - Confirms role consistency and no conflicts

5. **Conformance Declaration Record** (internal control document)
   - A sign-off record or compliance checklist confirming all R-01 through R-08 requirements have been verified prior to submission
   - Format: checklist with pass/fail status per requirement, verifier name, and date
   - Links to Procedure Step 8 final verification checklist for execution; this artifact records the verification outcome

## Notes

- **ASSUMPTION:** Specific team member names and credentials are TBD during proposal development; no specific personnel are designated in source documents at this time.
- **ASSUMPTION:** "Key members" are interpreted to include all persons named as key personnel in Appendix I (DEL-01-09), plus any principal/senior team members from the Design-Builder organization not captured in the subtrade list.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Disciplines required include at minimum: architecture, civil, structural, MEP (mechanical/electrical/plumbing), and construction management. Additional specialists are at the Proponent's discretion.
- **ASSUMPTION:** R-06 (availability/commitment statements) is inferred from OBJ-006 evaluation intent and industry practice; RFP §7.1.7 does not explicitly require them. Authority level is RECOMMENDED (not mandatory). Inclusion is strongly recommended to support "certainty of success" scoring (Exceptional band = 100%).
