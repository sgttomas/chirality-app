## Matrix D — Objectives (3x4)
### Construction: Addition A + resolution-transformed F

`L_D(i,j) = A(i,j) + ("resolution" * F(i,j))`

For each cell, compute "resolution" * F(i,j) first, then form the collection {A(i,j), resolution * F(i,j)}, then interpret with I(row_i, col_j, L_D).

#### Cell D(normative, guiding)
- A(normative, guiding) = "prescriptive direction"
- F(normative, necessity) — wait, D shares columns with A (guiding, applying, judging, reviewing), and F has columns (necessity, sufficiency, completeness, consistency). Let me re-check the construction.

D is 3x4 with columns [guiding, applying, judging, reviewing] and rows [normative, operative, evaluative].
A is 3x4 with the same layout. F is 3x4 with columns [necessity, sufficiency, completeness, consistency].

**Step 3:** Centroid of {total purposeful command, complete enacted valuation, total definitive evaluation, total quality accounting} -> u = "total merit evaluation"

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)
L_E = {purposeful worth orientation * coherent directed stability, enacted merit sufficiency * coherent enacted discipline, definitive worth judgment * coherent principled adjudication, assured quality governance * reliable governance assurance}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * consistency = consistent valuation

**Step 2:**
- t1 = purposeful worth orientation * coherent directed stability = "purposeful coherent stability"
- p1 = consistent valuation * purposeful coherent stability = "consistent purposeful coherence"
- t2 = enacted merit sufficiency * coherent enacted discipline = "disciplined merit coherence"
- p2 = consistent valuation * disciplined merit coherence = "consistent merit discipline"
- t3 = definitive worth judgment * coherent principled adjudication = "principled definitive coherence"
- p3 = consistent valuation * principled definitive coherence = "consistent principled valuation"
- t4 = assured quality governance * reliable governance assurance = "assured reliable quality"
- p4 = consistent valuation * assured reliable quality = "consistent assured quality"

**Step 3:** Centroid of {consistent purposeful coherence, consistent merit discipline, consistent principled valuation, consistent assured quality} -> u = "consistent merit governance"
