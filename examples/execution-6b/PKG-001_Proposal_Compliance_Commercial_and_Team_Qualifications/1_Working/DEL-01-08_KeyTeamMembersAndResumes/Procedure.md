# Key Team Members and Resumes — Procedure

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps to assemble, review, and finalize the Key Team Members deliverable for the Penhold PSB Design-Build proposal (RFP 2024_004). The procedure ensures:

1. All key personnel of the Design-Build team are identified and documented per RFP §7.1.7
2. Each resume does not exceed the 2-page limit (RFP §7.1.7, explicit constraint)
3. Resumes highlight relevant experience (comparable municipal facilities, design-build delivery)
4. Team documentation is internally consistent — summary table, individual resumes, and Appendix I (DEL-01-09) align on names, roles, and companies
5. The final resume package integrates cleanly into the single proposal PDF (RFP §4.2, 15 MB limit)

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, confirm the following inputs are available:

| Prerequisite | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Design-Build team composition decided (primary firm + prime consultants + key subtrade leads) | DEL-01-07 (Firm Experience) + preliminary Appendix I work | TBD |
| Appendix I (DEL-01-09) preliminary draft — names, companies, scope allocations | Proposal Manager | TBD |
| Historical resumes for each team member (for content refresh and update) | Each firm/HR | TBD |
| Project portfolio database — relevant project details (type, size, budget, client, completion date, individual's role) | Each firm | TBD |
| Professional license/registration verification (APEGA, AIBC, PEO, etc.) | Each team member | TBD |
| Confirmed proposal style guide (fonts, margins, formatting standards) | Proposal Manager | TBD |
| RFP 2024_004 §7.1.7 (confirmed text — accessible) | _Sources/ folder | Available |
| Project deadline: August 30, 2024 @ 14:00 MST | RFP §5.3 | Fixed |

## Prerequisite-Readiness Gate

Before proceeding to Step 1, the Proposal Manager shall confirm that all prerequisites listed in the Prerequisites table above have Status = Available (or a documented equivalent). If any prerequisite remains TBD or unavailable:

1. Document the gap in a brief Prerequisites Gap Log (item, reason unavailable, estimated resolution date).
2. Assess whether work can proceed in parallel (e.g., resume collection can begin while Appendix I draft is pending) or whether the gap is blocking (e.g., team composition not decided prevents Step 1).
3. For blocking gaps: escalate to Design-Build team leadership for resolution before proceeding.
4. For non-blocking gaps: proceed with available prerequisites and flag the gap for resolution before Step 7 (QA Review).

**Acceptance Criteria:** All blocking prerequisites resolved or escalated; non-blocking gaps documented with target resolution dates. (Source: Procedure Prerequisites table; lensing ref F-002)

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify and List All Key Personnel

**Action:**
- Using the preliminary team composition, create a master personnel list covering:
  - Design-Builder principals (Principal-in-Charge, Project Manager/Executive)
  - Prime consultants: Architecture, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical (and IT/specialty if applicable)
  - Key subtrade leads (construction superintendent, key trade leads whose names will appear in Appendix I)
  - Any specialist consultants whose individual credentials add scoring value (e.g., geotechnical reviewer, commissioning agent)
- Exclude: Junior staff, administrative personnel, and non-proposal-facing roles

**Output:** Master personnel list — columns: Full Name | Company | Proposed Project Role | Discipline | Contact Information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All persons who will be named in Appendix I (DEL-01-09) are on this list
- Disciplines covered: Architecture, Civil, Structural, MEP, Construction Management / Project Management
- Names are spelled consistently (check against email signatures and professional registration records)
- No duplicates; no gaps in key roles

**Responsibility:** Proposal Manager / HR

---

### Step 2: Collect and Update Individual Resumes

**Action:**
- Request the most current resume from each person on the master personnel list
- For each resume, confirm it includes:
  - Current professional title and company affiliation
  - Education (degrees, institution, year)
  - Professional licenses and certifications (with registration entity and number if possible; verify current status as of August 2024 using the following method: (a) perform an online registry lookup via APEGA, AIBC, PEO, or the applicable regulatory body's public member directory to confirm active registration status; (b) if online verification is unavailable, obtain a signed self-declaration from the team member confirming current registration status and date of last renewal; (c) record the verification method used and date checked for each credential in the master personnel list). (Source: Procedure Step 2; lensing ref A-003)
  - Work experience — last 5–10 years, emphasizing relevant projects
  - At least 3–5 project examples most relevant to Penhold PSB context (municipal, design-build, fire/PW facilities)
  - Each project example: facility type, gross floor area or budget, completion date, client type, individual's specific role
  - Professional affiliations (APEGA, AIBC, CSCE, ASHRAE, etc.)
- If a resume does not exist or is out of date, prepare one collaboratively with the team member

**Output:** Draft resumes for all identified key personnel (various formats initially acceptable)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Resume exists for every person on the master list
- Professional credentials are current (no expired licenses without renewal note)
- Relevant project examples are specific and quantified (not generic descriptions)
- No obvious formatting, spelling, or factual errors

**Responsibility:** Each team member, in coordination with HR and Proposal Manager

---

### Step 3: Prepare the Key Personnel Summary Table

**Action:**
- Create a formatted 1–2 page summary table of all key personnel using the following minimum column set:

| Name | Company / Firm | Professional Title | Proposed Project Role | Discipline | Years Relevant Experience | Key Qualifications |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- Suggested table organization order:
  1. Design-Builder: Principal-in-Charge, Project Manager
  2. Architecture team: Lead Architect, supporting designers
  3. Civil Engineering: Civil Lead
  4. Structural Engineering: Structural Lead
  5. Mechanical Engineering: MEP Lead
  6. Electrical / IT: Electrical Lead
  7. Construction Management: Construction Manager, Site Superintendent
  8. Key Subtrade Leads (as appropriate)

- Cross-check table against:
  - Master personnel list (Step 1) — all names included
  - Appendix I draft (DEL-01-09) — names and companies consistent
  - Individual resumes (Step 2) — experience years and credentials accurate

**Output:** Formatted key personnel summary table (1–2 pages, fits within proposal PDF structure)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Table is complete (no key positions missing)
- All fields populated accurately
- Formatting consistent with proposal style guide
- Names spelled identically to individual resumes and Appendix I

**Responsibility:** Proposal Manager with HR input

---

### Step 4: Obtain Availability and Commitment Statements

**Note:** RFP §7.1.7 does not explicitly require commitment statements. However, based on the OBJ-006 scoring rubric (Exceptional = "certainty of success"), proactively demonstrating personnel stability is strongly recommended. **ASSUMPTION:** This recommendation is inferred from OBJ-006 scoring intent, not from explicit RFP language.

**Action:**
- For each key team member, obtain a brief written statement (signed letter, email attestation, or completed form) confirming:
  - Commitment to the Penhold PSB project from award through substantial performance
  - Availability for the project duration (**ASSUMPTION:** approximately 24-36 months based on typical Design-Build municipal projects of this scale)
  - Proposed role and key responsibilities in the project
  - Acknowledgment that they have read the RFP scope and understand the commitment required

- Format options (choose one or combine per preference):
  - Individual signed letters from principal-level personnel (strongest signal)
  - Single organizational commitment letter from each company covering their key personnel
  - Completed availability attestation form (if Proposal Manager creates template)

- Statements should be dated within 30 days of proposal submission (i.e., no earlier than August 1, 2024)

**Output:** Signed availability/commitment statements for all key personnel

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Statement exists for every person in the summary table (Step 3)
- Statements address: commitment, availability, role, and project duration
- Dated within 30 days of submission
- Signatories are authorized representatives (Principal-in-Charge or designated officer)

**Responsibility:** HR / Proposal Manager to request and collect; each team member to provide

---

### Contingency: Late Personnel Changes

**Trigger:** A key team member becomes unavailable (resignation, reassignment, illness, or conflict of interest) after commitment statements have been collected (Step 4) but before final proposal submission (Step 8).

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager immediately notifies Design-Build team leadership and documents the personnel change (who, when notified, reason if known).
2. Identify a replacement candidate for the vacated role. The replacement must meet or exceed the qualification and experience criteria established in Specification R-01 through R-05 and Guidance P-002.
3. Execute Steps 2 through 4 for the replacement individual only:
   - Collect and update resume (Step 2)
   - Update summary table (Step 3)
   - Obtain new commitment/availability statement (Step 4)
4. Re-execute Step 5 (Appendix I consistency check) to confirm the replacement is reflected in DEL-01-09.
5. If no suitable replacement is available before the submission deadline:
   - Document the gap and assess impact on OBJ-006 scoring (refer to Guidance C-004 scoring band self-assessment).
   - Escalate to Design-Build team leadership for a go/no-go decision on submission with the identified gap.
6. Record all changes in the Appendix I reconciliation log (Step 5 output).

**ASSUMPTION:** Late personnel changes are an operational risk; this contingency addresses the most common scenario. Complex multi-person changes may require re-evaluation of the entire team composition. (Source: Procedure Steps 2-5; lensing ref C-002)

---

### Step 5: Verify Appendix I (DEL-01-09) Consistency

**Action:**
- Lay the summary table (Step 3) alongside the current Appendix I draft (DEL-01-09) and confirm:
  - All persons listed as key personnel in Appendix I have a corresponding resume in this deliverable
  - All persons with a resume here appear in Appendix I (or are Design-Builder principals not in the subtrade list)
  - Role titles, company names, and scope assignments are consistent between the two documents
  - No conflicting affiliations (same person listed under different companies in different documents)
- If conflicts found: reconcile with Appendix I author, update the relevant document, and record the resolution

**Output:**
- Confirmed consistency between DEL-01-08 and DEL-01-09
- Reconciliation log (if any conflicts were found and resolved)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Zero unresolved conflicts between the two documents on names, roles, or companies
- All named persons appear in both documents as expected
- Reconciliation log signed off by Proposal Manager

**Responsibility:** Proposal Manager

---

### Step 6: Format and Compile Resumes for Proposal Integration

**Action:**
- Convert all resumes to a consistent PDF format using the proposal style guide
- Apply uniform formatting:
  - Font: per proposal template standard (e.g., Calibri 11pt or Arial 10pt)
  - Margins: per proposal template standard (e.g., 1 in.)
  - Headers: Name + Title + Company on first page; consistent section headings (Education / Credentials / Experience / Projects)
  - Page footers: optional page number or document reference

- Enforce the 2-page limit:
  - Measure each resume after formatting
  - If a resume exceeds 2 pages: work with the team member to condense — remove projects older than 10 years; trim generic descriptions; use a table format for project lists to save space

- Determine placement within proposal PDF:
  - Option A (Embedded): Resumes follow the summary table as consecutive pages within the §7.1.7 section
  - Option B (Appendix): Resumes placed in a labeled appendix (e.g., "Appendix K — Key Personnel Resumes")
  - Note: RFP §7.1.7 and §4.3 do not specify placement beyond the heading order; choose whichever option best serves readability within the 15 MB limit

- Confirm all resume text is searchable (no scanned images):
  - Open each PDF page and verify text is selectable
  - If any resume is a scan, re-create or OCR-correct before including

**Output:**
- Fully formatted, compiled resume package ready for proposal integration
- Verification checklist (see below)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All resumes are ≤ 2 pages (verified by page count)
- Formatting is consistent across all resumes
- All text is searchable
- No confidential personal information exposed (remove: home address, personal phone, SIN)
- File size contribution is acceptable for 15 MB total proposal limit

**Responsibility:** Proposal Manager / Publishing/Graphics team

---

### Step 7: Quality Assurance Review

**Action:**
- **Proposal Manager Review:**
  - Confirm all RFP §7.1.7 requirements are met: key members identified; resumes provided; 2-page limit enforced
  - Check for spelling, grammar, and consistency in team member names and role titles across all resumes and summary table
  - Validate that team experience collectively covers the comparable-municipal-facility requirement

- **Compliance Review:**
  - Confirm no credentials are misrepresented or overstated
  - Verify credential-to-role alignment: confirm that each team member's listed professional registrations are relevant to their proposed discipline role (e.g., structural P.Eng. for structural lead; see Specification R-05 verification criteria)
  - Cross-check credential verification records from Step 2 (registry lookups or self-declarations) to confirm all registrations are current as of submission date
  - Verify no conflicts of interest are implied or concealed
  - Confirm all company affiliations are accurate

- **Design-Build Team Leadership Review:**
  - Principal-in-Charge or Project Executive reviews team composition for completeness
  - Confirms that proposed roles and time commitments are realistic given other project commitments
  - Authorizes the final version for inclusion in proposal

**Output:**
- Reviewed and approved resume package
- QA sign-off (email, checklist, or formal QA form per firm's process)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No unresolved review comments
- All reviewers have provided written or email approval
- Final version locked for proposal assembly

**Responsibility:** Proposal Manager; Design-Build team leadership; Compliance reviewer (if required)

---

### Step 8: Integrate into Final Proposal PDF and Final Verification

**Action:**
- Embed the summary table and all resumes into the final proposal PDF in the designated section/appendix
- Confirm proposal PDF total size remains ≤ 15 MB (RFP §4.2)
- Run final verification checklist:
  - [ ] All key members from Appendix I (DEL-01-09) have a corresponding resume in DEL-01-08
  - [ ] Summary table is complete, accurate, and consistently formatted
  - [ ] Every individual resume is ≤ 2 pages (hard limit, RFP §7.1.7)
  - [ ] All resume text is searchable (not scanned images)
  - [ ] No confidential personal information is exposed
  - [ ] Formatting is consistent with the rest of the proposal
  - [ ] Names, companies, and roles match Appendix I (DEL-01-09) exactly
  - [ ] Total proposal PDF ≤ 15 MB (RFP §4.2)
  - [ ] Commitment statements are present (recommended) or referenced in cover letter

**Output:**
- Final proposal PDF with key team member section integrated
- Completed verification checklist

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All checklist items pass
- No open compliance or formatting issues
- Proposal Manager and Project Executive have authorized final version for submission

**Responsibility:** Proposal Manager / Publishing team
