# Key Team Members and Resumes — Guidance

## Purpose

This deliverable directly addresses **OBJ-006 — Demonstrate a strong team and firm experience**, which carries **15 points** out of 100 — tied for second-highest technical criterion alongside Building Durability (§8.2 scoring table, RFP 2024_004).

The evaluation criterion is labeled "Project Team and Firms (Appendix I)" and encompasses DEL-01-07 (Firm Experience), DEL-01-08 (Key Team Members and Resumes), and DEL-01-09 (Appendix I subtrade list) together. The Town of Penhold's Evaluation Committee scores this criterion using a 7-level rubric (RFP §8.3): Exceptional (100%) → Excellent (90%) → Very Good (80%) → Good (70%) → Fair (60%) → Acceptable (50%) → Unacceptable (0–40%). To score in the Exceptional band, the response must "exceed expectations and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements that provides certainty of success and adds a level of innovation."

The key purpose of this deliverable is to give the Evaluation Committee **confidence** that:
1. The Design-Build team has successfully delivered comparable municipal facilities (fire halls, public works, combined-use civic buildings)
2. Named personnel will be present and committed for the full project duration
3. Professional credentials are current, verifiable, and appropriate to each role
4. The team structure is coherent, complete, and consistent across all submission documents

## Principles

### P-001: Alignment with Appendix I (Team Structure)
The personnel named in this deliverable must exactly match the team members identified in Appendix I (DEL-01-09). Evaluators will cross-check these documents; inconsistencies — misspelled names, different company affiliations, role title conflicts — undermine confidence.

**Rationale (RFP §4.3; OBJ-006):** The Owner evaluates team completeness and submission consistency; gaps or conflicts between DEL-01-08 and DEL-01-09 reduce the perceived reliability of the team.

### P-002: Prioritize Comparable Project Experience
The RFP evaluation criteria (OBJ-006) explicitly award points for demonstrating "relevant DB experience on similar municipal facilities" (Decomposition §7, OBJ-006). Prioritize project references that are:
- Municipal or public-sector clients (not just private commercial)
- Multi-facility or complex coordination (e.g., co-located fire and public works)
- Design-Build or integrated delivery method
- Similar functional scope (apparatus bays, public works shops, combined fire/PW operations)
- Alberta or comparable Canadian prairie climate context (freeze-thaw, heavy occupancy loads)

**Rationale:** Evaluators assess whether the team understands the unique challenges of municipal procurement, stakeholder engagement, and integrated-facility delivery; generic commercial experience alone does not meet the "similar municipal facilities" threshold.

### P-003: Conciseness and Targeted Relevance (2-Page Limit)
With a hard 2-page limit per resume (RFP §7.1.7), every sentence must earn its space. For each team member:
- Lead with role, credentials, and a one-line value proposition
- List 3–5 most relevant projects with concise descriptors (facility type, size, budget, completion date, delivery method, the individual's specific role)
- Avoid generic experience descriptions ("worked on various projects"); use measurable specifics

**Rationale (RFP §7.1.7; §8.3 scoring rubric):** Evaluators read many proposals; clear, focused resumes with quantified achievements are more persuasive than long, generic biographies.

### P-004: Current and Verifiable Professional Credentials
All listed licenses and certifications must be:
- Current at the time of proposal submission (August 30, 2024)
- Relevant to the specific role claimed (e.g., P.Eng. in structural for structural lead, not a different discipline)
- From recognized regulatory bodies (APEGA, AIBC, PEO, professional engineering associations)

**Rationale:** Falsifying or overstating credentials creates legal and reputational risk; accuracy builds the trust necessary for the "certainty of success" band in the scoring rubric.

### P-005: Demonstrate Personnel Stability and Commitment
The Evaluation Committee's primary concern beyond competence is **continuity**: will the named personnel actually deliver the project? Address this proactively:
- Include an availability statement or commitment declaration for each key team member
- Explicitly state the proposed role and approximate time commitment
- Note if a principal/senior leader is committed for the full duration vs. a supervisory/milestone role

**Rationale:** **ASSUMPTION** (from OBJ-006 scoring intent): Evaluators frequently discount proposals where key personnel commitments appear uncertain; demonstrating stability pushes scores toward Excellent or Exceptional bands.

### P-006: Consistent Terminology and Formatting
Use identical names, job titles, and company names across this deliverable, DEL-01-07, DEL-01-09, and any organizational chart in DEL-06-01. Apply a consistent format template across all resumes.

**Rationale (RFP §4.3; cross-document consistency rule):** Inconsistencies create doubt; consistent presentation reinforces the image of a well-organized, professional team.

## Considerations

### C-001: Three-Document Integration
DEL-01-08 does not stand alone. The 15-point OBJ-006 criterion is evaluated across three deliverables:
- **DEL-01-07** — Firm-level experience (organizational track record, comparable projects)
- **DEL-01-08** — Individual-level experience (key personnel resumes, credentials)
- **DEL-01-09** — Team structure (Appendix I subtrade/consultant roster, scope allocation)

A strong individual-level showing in DEL-01-08 amplifies the firm-level story in DEL-01-07. Gaps in either undermine the full 15 points.

### C-002: Timing and Currency
Resumes must reflect experience and credentials as of the proposal submission date (August 30, 2024). If a team member's most recent relevant project was completed close to this date, include it. If a license is near renewal, note the renewal status.

### C-003: Format and PDF Rendering
- Use consistent fonts, margins, and section headers across all resumes
- Ensure all text is searchable (not scanned images) — evaluators may search for keywords
- Test that the proposal PDF renders resumes correctly at final assembly (embedded vs. linked assets)
- Verify names are spelled identically in resumes, summary table, and Appendix I

### C-004: Scoring Band Implications
The 7-level rubric (RFP §8.3) suggests a clear performance ladder:
- **Acceptable (50%) or Fair (60%):** Resumes present but experience is generic or credentials are missing; incomplete team
- **Good (70%) to Very Good (80%):** Team is complete, credentials are current, some relevant project experience shown
- **Excellent (90%) to Exceptional (100%):** Team is complete, highly relevant experience on comparable municipal facilities, credentials verified, personnel stability demonstrated, presentation exceeds expectations

The incremental point value of moving from Good (70%) to Exceptional (100%) on a 15-point criterion = 4.5 additional points — potentially decisive in a competitive bid.

#### Self-Assessment Scoring Rubric (Internal Use)

To target specific scoring bands, producers should verify the following internal benchmarks before submission. **ASSUMPTION:** These thresholds are inferred from the RFP §8.3 rubric language and OBJ-006 evaluation intent; they are not Owner-prescribed.

| Target Band | Key Personnel | Project Experience | Credentials | Commitment | Presentation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Exceptional (100%)** | All key discipline positions filled with named individuals; no gaps | Each resume cites 3+ comparable municipal DB projects with quantified specifics (sf, $, year, role) | All credentials current, verified via registry, discipline-relevant to proposed role | Signed commitment statements for all key members, dated within 30 days | Consistent formatting; zero cross-document conflicts with DEL-01-09 |
| **Excellent (90%)** | All key positions filled; minor specialist gaps acceptable | Each resume cites 3+ relevant projects; at least 2 are municipal/public-sector | All credentials current and listed with registration entities | Commitment statements for principal-level personnel at minimum | Consistent formatting; minor typographical issues only |
| **Very Good (80%)** | Core positions filled (architecture, structural, MEP, CM); 1 specialist TBD | Each resume cites 2–3 relevant projects; mix of municipal and private | Credentials listed; 1–2 may be near renewal | Commitment addressed in cover letter but not individual statements | Generally consistent formatting |
| **Good (70%)** | Core positions filled; some resumes show generic rather than targeted experience | 1–2 relevant projects per resume; limited municipal/DB specifics | Credentials listed but registration entities not always named | No explicit commitment statements | Formatting inconsistencies between resumes |

### C-005: Role of CCDC 14-2013

The Specification Standards table lists CCDC 14-2013 (Design-Build Stipulated Price Contract) as "Informative context." Its inclusion is warranted because CCDC 14 frames the contractual expectations for design-build team competency, role allocation, and single-point accountability. While CCDC 14 does not impose specific personnel qualification requirements, it establishes the delivery model context within which team members operate. Producers should understand that the Owner's evaluation of "team qualifications" (OBJ-006) occurs within a CCDC 14 design-build framework, meaning: (a) the Design-Builder bears integrated responsibility for both design and construction personnel, and (b) evaluators expect the proposed team to demonstrate familiarity with integrated delivery roles, not just discipline-specific expertise.

**ASSUMPTION:** CCDC 14-2013 is informative context only and does not impose binding personnel requirements beyond what is stated in the RFP. If the RFP or contract documents specify CCDC 14 as the contract form, this assessment may need to be revisited. (Source: Specification Standards table; lensing ref F-001)

## Trade-offs

| ID | Trade-off | Considerations | Recommendation |
|----|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **T-001** | Depth vs. Breadth in project listings | Include many projects (breadth) or few projects with detail (depth)? | Depth: 3–5 highly relevant projects with specifics (budget, size, delivery method, role) outweigh 10 generic project names on a 2-page resume. |
| **T-002** | Individual credentials vs. firm backing | Emphasize the individual's track record or the firm's institutional resources? | Both: Lead with individual credentials and project-specific experience, then briefly anchor to firm size, financial stability, or specialist resources available. |
| **T-003** | Senior principals vs. working-level project managers | Feature the Principal-in-Charge (prestige) or the Day-to-Day Project Manager (competence)? | Both: Include Principal-in-Charge (commitment signal) AND key working-level PM and design leads (delivery confidence). Evaluators want both executive accountability and technical competence. |
| **T-004** | Historical experience vs. proposed role framing | List past experience in historical narrative or frame explicitly against the Penhold PSB role? | Dual framing: Describe past accomplishments, then explicitly state the proposed role for Penhold PSB. This connects past evidence to future performance. |
| **T-005** | Resume length enforcement | Some team members may have extensive careers that are difficult to summarize in 2 pages. | Enforce the 2-page limit without exception (RFP §7.1.7). Longer resumes may be perceived as non-compliant. Prioritize the last 10 years and the 3–5 most relevant projects. |

## Examples

The following are **conceptual examples** illustrating what strong resumes might look like for this project context. All names, firms, and project details are hypothetical. **ASSUMPTION:** Actual personnel to be confirmed during proposal development.

**How to use these examples:** EX-001 and EX-002 are structural templates, not optional illustrations. When producing actual resumes during Procedure Steps 2-6:
1. Replace all bracketed fields (e.g., `[Name]`, `[Architecture Firm]`) with actual data.
2. Ensure project examples match the relevance criteria in P-002 (municipal, design-build, comparable facility type).
3. Maintain the structural pattern: lead with role and credentials, then list 3-5 quantified project examples, then credentials detail, then availability statement.
4. Adapt the format to the proposal style guide while preserving the content structure shown here.
