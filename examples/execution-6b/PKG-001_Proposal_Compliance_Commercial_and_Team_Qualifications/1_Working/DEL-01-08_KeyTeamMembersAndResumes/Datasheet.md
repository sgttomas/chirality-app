## Notes

- Actual personnel names, credentials, and experience details are TBD and will be populated during proposal development.
- The 2-page limit per resume is an explicit RFP requirement (§7.1.7), not a guideline; it must be enforced strictly.
- This deliverable is jointly scored with DEL-01-07 (Firm Experience) and DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) under the single "Project Team and Firms" criterion (15 pts per §8.2).
- **TBD (Owner Clarification Needed):** What is the minimum set of named key positions required? RFP §7.1.7 says "key members" without enumeration. The current Key Positions list in Attributes is an **ASSUMPTION** based on OBJ-006 context and standard design-build team composition. Confirm whether Owner expects a minimum list of required roles.
