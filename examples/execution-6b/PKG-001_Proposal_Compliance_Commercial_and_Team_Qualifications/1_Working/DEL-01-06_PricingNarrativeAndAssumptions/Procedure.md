**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (cross-reference verification).

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish Narrative Structure & Content Outline

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager creates a working outline of the pricing narrative based on Specification section R-01 (all required sections) and Guidance section P-01 (structure principles):
   - Overview & Pricing Philosophy
   - Pricing Assumptions (labor/material bases, contingency)
   - Allowances & Exclusions
   - Insurance & Bonding Costs
   - Value Optimization Alternatives
   - References & Cross-Links

2. Estimator and Proposal Manager confirm target page count (recommend 3–4 pages per Guidance T-01) and assign sections:
   - Estimator: Pricing Assumptions, Allowances (detailed cost justification)
   - Proposal Manager: Overview, Exclusions, Insurance/Bonding Statement, Value Alternatives, References/Cross-Links
   - Both: Review for consistency and tone

3. Proposal Manager creates a tracking table showing:
   - Section name
   - Assigned author
   - Key content requirements (from Specification R-01 through R-12)
   - Status (In Progress / Draft / Review / Approved)
   - Traceability checklist (RFP ref, Addendum ref, DEC ref)

**Verification:**
- Outline is documented (in proposal internal working file or shared document).
- All required Specification requirements are mapped to outline sections.
- Assignments and target completion dates are confirmed with Estimator and Proposal Manager.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (coordination); Estimator (technical input on cost assumptions).

---

### Step 2: Draft Pricing Assumptions Section

**Action:**
1. Estimator drafts the "Pricing Assumptions" section explaining:
   - Labor rate basis: source, date, location/wage zone, any escalation applied
   - Material cost basis: quotes received, budget date, any escalation applied
   - Contingency allocation (if any): percentage, rationale, what it covers
   - Overhead & profit structure (if breakdown is helpful for transparency)
   - Any other key assumptions affecting the total cost

2. Estimator cites sources for all major assumptions:
   - "Labor rates based on Alberta prevailing wage data as of [date] from [source]"
   - "Material quotes received August 2024 from [key suppliers]"
   - "Contingency: [X]% allocated for labor cost inflation and design uncertainty, consistent with [industry standard / project phase]"

3. If specific numbers are not yet finalized, Estimator marks as TBD with placeholder:
   - "Material allowance for electrical equipment: $[TBD]; to be confirmed by MEP consultant upon receipt of fixture schedules."
   - "Contingency percentage: [TBD]; to be determined by Estimator upon schedule and detail estimate finalization."

4. Estimator provides draft to Proposal Manager for review and integration into full narrative.

**Verification:**
- Assumptions section is documented, sources are cited, and TBD placeholders are clearly marked.
- Proposal Manager confirms that all assumptions are traceable to Schedule B detail (can Proposal Manager see these assumptions reflected in Schedule B line items?).

**Responsible Party:** Estimator (content); Proposal Manager (review & integration).

---

### Step 3: Draft Allowances & Exclusions Sections

**Action:**
1. Estimator and Proposal Manager jointly draft:

   **A. Site Servicing Allowance**
   - Scope covered: list of utility types (water, sewer, electrical, gas, communications)
   - Amount: $[TBD] pending final site coordination and tie-in design
   - Justification: market data for tie-in work type/complexity in Penhold area
   - Risk boundary: who bears cost if tie-in is more expensive than allowance (typically change order)
   - Reference: Addendum 03 Section 1.7

   **B. FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment)**
   - Explicitly state: NOT in base cost per Addendum 03 Section 1.18
   - Amount: $20,000 additional option (Fixed per DEC-012)
   - Scope covered: [TBD pending design finalization; placeholder: "Basic operational furnishings for administrative areas, break room, training room, and operational equipment racks"]
   - Schedule A reference: Additional Option 6
   - Reference: Addendum 03 Section 1.18; DEC-012

   **C. Exclusions**
   - Pickled Sand Storage: excluded per Addendum 03 Section 1.2; subject to separate RFP
   - Additional Geotechnical Investigation: no allowance per DEC-013; existing 2021 report is basis
   - [Any other known exclusions identified in design/estimate phase]

2. For each allowance/exclusion, include:
   - Clear statement (e.g., "INCLUDED" vs. "EXCLUDED")
   - Scope description
   - Dollar amount (or TBD if not yet finalized)
   - Traceable source (Addendum, DEC, RFP section)
   - Implication for design (e.g., "Tie-in design will be finalized upon service provider confirmation of connection points")

3. Proposal Manager integrates Allowances/Exclusions section into full narrative and ensures consistency with Schedule A/B.

**Verification:**
- Allowances & Exclusions section is comprehensive and sources are cited per Specification R-02 through R-05.
- Proposal Manager cross-checks against Schedule A/B to confirm that:
  - Site servicing allowance amount (if not TBD) appears in Schedule A or Schedule B
  - FF&E $20,000 is shown as Additional Option 6, outside base cost total
  - Pickled sand and geotechnical investigation are NOT listed as line items in Schedule B
- Any discrepancies between narrative and Schedule A/B are flagged for resolution (Step 5, Cross-Document Consistency).

**Responsible Party:** Estimator (cost justification); Proposal Manager (coordination, Schedule alignment).

---

### Step 4: Draft Insurance & Bonding Statement

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager (with support from Risk/Insurance Consultant if available) drafts a statement confirming:

   **A. CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) Inclusion**
   - Explicit statement: "Contractor Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP) costs are included in the proposal price."
   - RFP authority: Section 9.14 (allows Design-Builder to elect OCIP or CCIP)
   - Reference to DEC-011 (OI-003, CLOSED): "Per DEC-011, the Design-Builder has elected CCIP structure."
   - Types of insurance included (per Appendix J): general liability, builders risk, workers comp on-site, professional liability, etc.
   - Phrase: "The Design-Builder will arrange and carry all project insurance per the Supplementary Conditions (Appendix J)."

   **B. Bonding Costs Inclusion**
   - Explicit statement: "Performance Bond (50% of Contract Price) and Labour & Materials Bond (50% of Contract Price) costs are included in the proposal price."
   - RFP authority: Section 5.3.1
   - Reference to DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance Evidence) for supporting documentation
   - Bonding cost estimate (if available): "Bonding costs are estimated at $[TBD] (approximately [X]% of contract price) and are embedded in the proposal total."

2. Proposal Manager provides draft to Estimator for confirmation that bonding/insurance costs are actually included in the Schedule B detail or in general conditions/profit margin.

3. Insurance/Bonding Statement is integrated into full narrative.

**Verification:**
- CCIP and bonding cost statements are explicit and traceable per Specification R-06.
- Proposal Manager confirms with DEL-01-03 author that bonding/insurance evidence document is finalized and supports the narrative statement.
- Estimator confirms that bonding/insurance costs are included in Schedule B (either as separate line items or absorbed in general conditions).

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (draft); Risk/Insurance Consultant (if available); Estimator (cost confirmation).

---

### Step 5: Draft Value Optimization Alternatives Section

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager and Design Lead jointly identify candidate value alternatives:
   - Examples from Guidance section (enhanced insulation, solar-ready design, advanced BMS)
   - Other alternatives identified by design team or estimator (cost-saving options, enhanced performance options, phasing alternatives, etc.)

2. For each alternative:
   - Confirm compliance status: Does it maintain all mandatory RFP requirements? (Per SOW-0031 constraint: "Must not undermine base compliance")
   - If NOT compliant, EXCLUDE from alternatives list (it undermines the proposal)
   - If compliant, continue to next step

3. For each compliant alternative, create a summary:
   - Alternative Title: Brief, descriptive
   - Description: 1–2 sentence explanation
   - Cost Impact: "+$X" (additional cost), or "$0" (no additional cost), or "–$X" (cost saving)
   - Value Impact: "~$Y annual savings" or "improves [performance metric] by [X%]" or "enables [benefit]"
   - Compliance Status: "Maintains all mandatory requirements; meets [RFP section X] baseline or exceeds"

4. Proposal Manager organizes alternatives into a table (recommended format per Guidance section Examples) and integrates into narrative.

5. Proposal Manager ensures that the alternatives section:
   - Is clearly labeled "OPTIONAL" or "ADDITIONAL OPTIONS" (not base scope)
   - Does NOT inflate the base proposal cost total (Schedule A base cost remains unchanged)
   - Does NOT modify any mandatory requirement language (all requirements are met in base scope)

**Verification:**
- Value Alternatives section is present and compliant with SOW-0031 (no undermining of base compliance).
- Each alternative has a compliance statement confirming mandatory requirements are met.
- Schedule A shows that alternatives are priced separately from base cost total.
- Proposal Manager screens for any alternative that could be misinterpreted as a scope reduction (e.g., "We can reduce apparatus bays to save cost") and EXCLUDES any such alternatives.

**Responsible Party:** Design Lead & Estimator (alternatives identification); Proposal Manager (compliance screening, documentation).

---

### Step 6: Draft Overview, References & Cross-Links Section

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager drafts Overview section:
   - Brief statement of pricing philosophy (e.g., "Pricing reflects a comprehensive Design-Build delivery per CCDC 14-2013 terms, based on [current market labor/material costs], with appropriate contingencies for design development.")
   - Positioning tone: transparent, thorough, confident
   - Reference to RFP Section 8.5 and applicable Addenda

2. Proposal Manager drafts References & Cross-Links section:
   - List of sources: RFP Section 8.5, Addendum 03, Decomposition decisions (DEC-012, DEC-011, DEC-013)
   - Cross-references to Schedule A (DEL-01-04) for pricing totals
   - Cross-references to Schedule B (DEL-01-05) for cost detail
   - Cross-references to DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance) for supporting evidence
   - Any other notes on how the narrative supports the proposal's compliance and credibility

3. Proposal Manager integrates Overview and References/Cross-Links into the full narrative document.

**Verification:**
- Overview is concise and professional; sets appropriate tone.
- References section cites all sources per Specification R-01 through R-12 (all 12 requirements are traceable).
- Cross-links to Schedule A/B/DEL-01-03 are accurate and verifiable.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (draft & integration).

---

### Step 7: Integrate All Sections into Complete Narrative Document

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager assembles all draft sections from Steps 1–6 into a single document:
   - Sections in order: Overview → Assumptions → Allowances & Exclusions → Insurance/Bonding → Alternatives → References
   - Consistent formatting (headings, tables, fonts)
   - Page numbering and table of contents (if document is longer than 2 pages)
   - Internal cross-references are active/correct

2. Proposal Manager reviews full narrative for:
   - Consistency of language and tone across all sections (avoid "author seams")
   - Consistency of numerical values (if Schedule B is finalized, confirm all numbers in narrative match Schedule B)
   - Clarity of assumptions and traceability (every major statement is sourced or labeled TBD)
   - Compliance with Specification R-01 through R-12 (all 12 requirements addressed)
   - Compliance with Guidance principles P-01 through P-06 (traceability, honesty, clarity, etc.)

3. Proposal Manager marks document status as "Draft: Ready for Estimator/Cost Review" and distributes to Estimator and Design Lead.

**Verification:**
- Complete narrative document is assembled and internally consistent.
- All Specification requirements (R-01 through R-12) are addressed.
- All TBDs are marked clearly (e.g., "Amount: $[TBD]").
- Document is ready for Step 8 review.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager.

---

### Step 7a: TBD Tracking & Second-Pass Trigger

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager creates or updates a TBD Register listing all items marked TBD in the narrative, including:
   - TBD Item ID (sequential)
   - Section where TBD appears
   - Description of missing information
   - Required input (what data is needed to resolve)
   - Input provider (Estimator, Design Lead, Proposal Manager, etc.)
   - Target resolution date
   - Status (Open / Resolved / Deferred)

2. Proposal Manager distributes the TBD Register to all input providers and confirms target resolution dates.

3. **Second-pass trigger:** The narrative proceeds to Step 8 (Estimator & Cost Review) only when:
   - All cost-critical TBDs (site servicing allowance amount, contingency percentage, labor/material rate bases) are resolved or have confirmed resolution dates within the proposal timeline, OR
   - The Estimator and Proposal Manager agree that remaining TBDs are non-blocking for the review cycle (e.g., cosmetic items, formatting details)

4. If any TBD remains unresolved at the time of final review (Step 11), it must be explicitly flagged in the Final Reviewer briefing and a decision recorded on whether to submit with TBD or defer submission.

**Verification:**
- TBD Register is documented and distributed to input providers.
- All cost-critical TBDs have assigned owners and target dates.
- Second-pass trigger criteria are met before proceeding to Step 8.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (TBD tracking and second-pass trigger management).

(Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-003; Source: Guidance C-01 two-pass authoring approach)

---

### Step 8: Estimator & Cost Review

**Action:**
1. Estimator reviews the complete narrative draft for:
   - **Accuracy:** All cost assumptions, labor rates, material bases, contingencies are accurately represented and match Schedule B detail.
   - **Completeness:** All major cost drivers are explained and traceable.
   - **Alignment with Schedule B:** Every line item in Schedule B can be traced to an assumption in the narrative, or there is a clear note explaining why not.
   - **Risk:** Any unsafe or overstated assumptions are flagged; narrative should not promise what Schedule B cannot deliver.

2. Estimator provides written comments or track-changes on the narrative document, including:
   - Corrections to numbers or assumptions
   - Suggestions for clarity or additional explanation
   - Sign-off: "Estimate is final and accurately reflected in narrative" or "Estimate pending [TBD items]; narrative sections marked TBD are appropriate"

3. Estimator confirms that Schedule B is consistent with narrative (or flag differences for Proposal Manager to resolve).

4. Proposal Manager integrates Estimator's feedback and generates revised draft.

**Verification:**
- Estimator has reviewed and approved cost assumptions and accuracy.
- All Estimator comments are addressed (resolved or escalated for decision).
- Narrative and Schedule B are confirmed as internally consistent.

**Responsible Party:** Estimator (cost review); Proposal Manager (feedback integration).

---

### Step 9: Design & Compliance Review

**Action:**
1. Design Lead and Proposal Manager review the complete narrative for:
   - **Scope Alignment:** All allowances/exclusions accurately reflect design scope (e.g., site servicing tie-in design is feasible; FF&E scope is realistic).
   - **Alternative Feasibility:** All value alternatives are technically feasible and do not undermine mandatory requirements.
   - **Tone & Positioning:** Narrative positions the Design-Builder as competent, thorough, and value-conscious.

2. Design Lead provides feedback on any design implications or clarifications needed (e.g., "Site servicing tie-in assumption requires coordination with Town's utility provider; note that" or "FF&E scope should clarify that specialized apparatus fixtures are excluded").

3. Proposal Manager integrates Design feedback and generates revised draft.

**Verification:**
- Design scope is accurately reflected in narrative.
- All alternatives are confirmed as compliant with mandatory requirements.
- Proposal tone is professional and confident.

**Responsible Party:** Design Lead (scope/compliance review); Proposal Manager (feedback integration).

---

### Step 10: Cross-Document Consistency Check (Step 5 of Protocol)

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager performs a detailed cross-document consistency check against:
   - **Schedule A (DEL-01-04):** Base cost total, Additional Options structure, alignment with narrative
   - **Schedule B (DEL-01-05):** Detailed line items, labor/material assumptions, contingency, alignment with narrative
   - **DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance):** Bonding costs, insurance coverage types, CCIP statement, alignment with narrative
   - **Datasheet/Specification/Guidance/Procedure (this document set):** Consistency of terminology, values, scope

2. Proposal Manager creates a Consistency Matrix using the following minimum template:

   | Column | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | Item ID | Sequential identifier (CM-001, CM-002, ...) |
   | Item / Assumption | The specific claim, value, or treatment stated in the DEL-01-06 narrative |
   | Narrative Section | Section of DEL-01-06 where the item appears |
   | Source Reference | Authoritative source (RFP section, Addendum, DEC, Schedule A/B line) |
   | Expected Value / Treatment | What the narrative states or implies |
   | Actual Value in Cross-Ref Doc | What Schedule A, Schedule B, or DEL-01-03 shows |
   | Cross-Ref Document | Which document was checked (DEL-01-04, DEL-01-05, DEL-01-03) |
   | Status | Consistent / Inconsistent / TBD |
   | Resolution Notes | If inconsistent: what action was taken or what human ruling is needed |

   **Minimum entries required:** At a minimum, the Consistency Matrix shall include one entry for each of the following:
   - Site servicing allowance amount (narrative vs. Schedule A/B)
   - FF&E $20,000 treatment (narrative vs. Schedule A Additional Option 6 vs. Schedule B)
   - Pickled sand exclusion (narrative vs. absence from Schedule A/B)
   - Geotechnical exclusion (narrative vs. absence from Schedule A/B)
   - CCIP cost inclusion (narrative vs. Schedule B or general conditions)
   - Bonding cost inclusion (narrative vs. Schedule B or general conditions)
   - Contingency percentage (narrative vs. Schedule B)
   - Value alternatives (narrative vs. Schedule A segregation)

   (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md D-002; Source: Procedure Step 10)

3. For any inconsistencies or TBDs:
   - If resolvable (e.g., numeric value was updated in Schedule B, narrative needs to match): Fix in narrative
   - If unresolvable from available sources: Mark as "TBD for human ruling" and note in Guidance Conflict Table

4. Proposal Manager signs off on consistency check completion.

**Verification:**
- Consistency Matrix is complete and all items are verified.
- Any inconsistencies are documented and resolved (or escalated to human ruling with Conflict Table entry).
- Narrative, Schedule A/B, and DEL-01-03 are confirmed as internally consistent.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (consistency check).

---

### Step 11: Final Review & Approval

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager prepares narrative for final review and approval by Proposal Lead/Project Manager (or client authority, as appropriate to proposal governance).

2. Final Reviewer examines:
   - **Compliance:** All RFP Section 8.5 requirements are met; all Addendum impacts are addressed; all Specification requirements (R-01 through R-12) are fulfilled.
   - **Quality:** Document is professional, clear, well-organized, and free of errors.
   - **Tone:** Positions the Design-Builder appropriately (competent, thorough, value-conscious).
   - **Traceability:** All major assumptions are sourced or labeled TBD.

3. Final Reviewer provides approval or conditional approval with required revisions.

4. If revisions are required, Proposal Manager addresses them and resubmits for approval.

5. Upon final approval, Proposal Manager marks document as "APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION" and schedules for inclusion in proposal package assembly (typically Week X per proposal master schedule).

**Verification:**
- Final Reviewer has approved narrative document.
- Document is marked "APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION" and included in master proposal package checklist.

**Responsible Party:** Final Reviewer/Proposal Lead (approval); Proposal Manager (coordination).

---

### Step 12: Proposal Package Assembly & Submission

**Action:**
1. Proposal Manager confirms that DEL-01-06 (pricing narrative) is assembled into Appendix H package with:
   - Schedule A (DEL-01-04: Pricing Summary)
   - Schedule B (DEL-01-05: Cost Breakdown)
   - DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance Evidence)
   - Any other required appendices per RFP 4.3

2. Proposal Manager verifies:
   - All documents are finalized and approved per Step 11.
   - All cross-references between documents are correct and active (if PDF: links work; if print: references are accurate).
   - Total package size complies with RFP 4.2 (single PDF under 15 MB).
   - All Addenda acknowledgements are completed (RFP 5.3; Appendix H requirements).

3. Proposal Manager confirms that the complete proposal package (including Appendix H with DEL-01-06) is ready for submission per RFP 5.3 deadline.

**Verification:**
- DEL-01-06 is included in Appendix H package and all cross-references are verified.
- Package complies with RFP format and size requirements.
- Proposal is ready for submission.

**Responsible Party:** Proposal Manager (assembly & submission).

---

### V-02: Traceability Audit

**Item:** All major assumptions are traceable to RFP, Addendum, Decomposition, or marked TBD.

**Method:** Proposal Manager performs a line-by-line review of the narrative, confirming each statement is either:
- Sourced: "Per RFP Section X.Y" or "Per Addendum Z Section W" or "Per DEC-NNN"
- Reasonable inference: Labeled "ASSUMPTION: [statement]"
- Incomplete: Marked "TBD pending [condition]"

**Verification:** No unsourced factual claims (all claims are sourced, ASSUMPTION, or TBD).

---

### V-03: Cross-Document Consistency Audit

**Item:** Narrative values, terminology, and scope are consistent with Schedule A, Schedule B, and DEL-01-03.

**Method:** Proposal Manager completes Consistency Matrix (Step 10) and confirms all major items are consistent or reconciled.

---

### V-04a: Records Retention Verification

**Item:** Working files are retained for 12 months post-submission per Records R-01.

**Method:** Proposal Manager confirms:
- All working files listed in Records R-01 are stored in the designated proposal archive location
- The retention period end date (12 months from submission date) is recorded in the proposal archive register or project filing system
- A calendar reminder or tickler is set for the retention period expiry date to trigger a retention review (retain, extend, or dispose per project governance)

**Verification:** Records retention is confirmed and tracked. Retention period end date is documented. This check mitigates audit risk if post-submission questions arise regarding pricing assumptions or cost basis.
