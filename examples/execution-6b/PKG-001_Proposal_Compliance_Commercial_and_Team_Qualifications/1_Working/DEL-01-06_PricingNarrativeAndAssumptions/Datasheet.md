## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Evaluation weight** | 35 points (highest-weighted criterion overall) | Decomposition §15; RFP §8 |
| **RFP section governing** | RFP Section 8.5 (value alternatives listed separately; narrative structure) | Decomposition §9, SOW-0030/SOW-0031 |
| **Contract form** | CCDC 14-2013 with Supplementary Conditions (Appendix J) | Decomposition §1 |
| **Delivery method** | Design-Build | Decomposition §1 |
| **Insurance approach confirmed** | CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) — costs included in proposal price | Decomposition §12, OI-003 (DEC-011, CLOSED) |
| **Bond types and amounts** | Performance Bond 50% + Labour & Materials Payment Bond 50% of Contract Price | Decomposition §3, C-08; RFP §5.3.1 |
| **Bond cost treatment** | Included in proposal pricing | Decomposition §9, DEL-01-03; SOW-0004 |
| **FF&E treatment** | NOT in base cost per Addendum 03 §1.18; offered as Additional Option 6 with $20,000 cash allowance on Schedule A line 1-7 / Schedule B Additional Item 6 | Decomposition §3, C-11; §12, OI-002 (DEC-012, CLOSED); Addendum 03 §1.18 |
| **Site servicing treatment** | Cash allowance permitted per Addendum 03 §1.7; service tie-in costs not required in proposal base pricing; allowance amount TBD. **Resolution trigger:** Estimator to finalize amount based on utility provider quotes, site coordination outcomes, and tie-in design scope (water, sewer, electrical, gas, communications). **ASSUMPTION:** Resolution is blocked until these inputs are received. | Decomposition §3, C-12; Addendum 03 §1.7 |
| **Pickled sand storage** | EXCLUDED from proposal scope per Addendum 03 §1.2; subject to separate future RFP | Decomposition §3, C-10; Addendum 03 §1.2 |
| **Additional geotechnical investigation** | EXCLUDED; no pricing allowance; existing 2021 report used as basis per DEC-013 | Decomposition §12, OI-004 (DEC-013, CLOSED) |
| **Addenda acknowledged** | Addenda 01 (Jul 11, 2024), 02 (Jul 15, 2024), 03 (Jul 31, 2024) — all integrated into pricing | Decomposition §2, §4 |
| **Value alternatives** | Listed separately per RFP §8.5 in a standalone section; must not undermine base compliance | Decomposition §9, SOW-0031; RFP §8.5 |
| **Currency / taxes treatment** | Taxes shown separately from base contract amounts in Appendix H. **Note:** Tax treatment is a Schedule A/B formatting concern (Appendix H template); the pricing narrative itself does not need to address tax treatment unless the Proposal Manager determines otherwise. **ASSUMPTION:** Tax separation is handled by Schedule A/B formatting per Appendix H, not by narrative content. See Guidance B-002 clarification. | Decomposition §9, DEL-01-04; Appendix H format |
| **Audience** | Town of Penhold evaluation committee (primary); Design-Builder internal team (secondary) | OBJ-007 |

## Conditions

| Condition | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Addendum hierarchy** | If conflict exists between base RFP and an addendum, the addendum governs | Decomposition §2 |
| **Pricing template required** | Appendix H (Schedule A + Schedule B) | Decomposition §3, C-05 |
| **Addenda acknowledgement** | Line in Appendix H must be completed; failure may disqualify price proposal. **Critical compliance risk:** This is a mandatory mechanical step (completing the acknowledgement line) separate from the narrative discussion of addenda impacts. See Specification R-11 for standalone requirement. | Decomposition §3, C-07; RFP §2.9, App H |
| **PDF submission format** | Single PDF under 15 MB; email submission; sections in required order | Decomposition §3, C-01, C-04 |
| **Schedule flexibility** | Owner is NOT schedule-driven; proponent may optimize for cost and value | Decomposition §1 |
| **Estimate maturity at proposal stage** | Site servicing allowance amount is TBD pending estimator finalization; all TBDs must be clearly marked. **Required inputs for resolution:** utility provider quotes, site coordination outcomes, and tie-in design scope confirmation from Estimator. | Specification R-02; Guidance C-01 |
| **Open issues — all resolved** | OI-002 (FF&E), OI-003 (CCIP), OI-004 (geotech) all CLOSED; decisions are locked | Decomposition §12, §13 |

## Construction (Anticipated Artifacts)

| Artifact | Description | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| **Pricing Narrative Document** | Written narrative covering: overview of pricing philosophy, pricing assumptions (labor/material bases, contingency), allowances (site servicing, FF&E), exclusions (pickled sand, no additional geotech), addenda pricing impacts, CCIP and bond cost inclusion statements. Final format: PDF in Appendix H of proposal submission. | Estimator / PM |
| **Value Alternatives List** | Separate list of value-optimization alternatives per RFP §8.5; each entry includes description, cost/value impact, and compliance status confirmation. Must not inflate base cost or undermine mandatory requirements. | Estimator / PM (with Design Lead input) |
| **TBD Register** | Internal working document tracking all TBD items in the narrative through resolution. Includes item ID, section, required input, input provider, target date, and status. Created at Procedure Step 7a. | Proposal Manager |
| **Consistency Matrix** | Internal working document for cross-document consistency check (Procedure Step 10). Minimum 8 entries covering all major pricing items. | Proposal Manager |
