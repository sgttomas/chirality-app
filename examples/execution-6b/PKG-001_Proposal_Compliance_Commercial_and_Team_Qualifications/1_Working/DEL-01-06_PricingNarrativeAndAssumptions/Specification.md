# Specification — DEL-01-06: Pricing Narrative and Assumptions

## Scope

### What This Deliverable Covers

DEL-01-06 is the commercial narrative component of the proposal's financial submission (Appendix H, RFP Section 8.5). It provides:

1. **Pricing assumptions and clarifications** explaining the basis for the cost estimate and how major cost drivers are treated
2. **Allowances and exclusions** listing all known cost inclusions/exclusions with traceability to RFP and Addenda
3. **Addenda integration narrative** explaining how pricing reflects Addendum 01, 02, and 03 impacts
4. **Insurance and bonding statements** confirming CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) and bond costs are included in the proposal price
5. **Value optimization alternatives** listed separately per RFP Section 8.5, documented in a way that does not undermine base compliance

### Audiences & Usage

- **Primary:** Town of Penhold evaluation committee (scoring component: price proposal, 35 points)
- **Secondary:** Design-Builder's internal estimating/accounting team (cost assumption validation)
- **Interface:** Must align with Schedule A (pricing totals) and Schedule B (cost detail breakdown)

### What This Deliverable Does NOT Cover

- Detailed cost line items (covered by DEL-01-05: Schedule B)
- Pricing totals summary (covered by DEL-01-04: Schedule A)
- Bonding agreement documents or insurance certificates (covered by DEL-01-03: Bonding and Insurance Evidence)
- Design or construction methodology (covered by other packages)
- Value engineering studies or detailed cost justifications beyond narrative summary

## Requirements

### R-01: Pricing Narrative Structure & Completeness

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall address, at minimum, the following sections as per RFP Section 8.5:

1. Overview of pricing philosophy and cost calculation approach
2. Pricing assumptions (labor rate basis, material cost basis, dates, escalation logic)
3. Major allowances (site servicing, FF&E)
4. Exclusions and clarifications
5. Insurance (CCIP) and bonding cost inclusion statement
6. Value optimization alternatives (listed separately)

**Traceability:**
- Source: RFP Section 8.5, Addendum 03 clarifications
- Verification: Proposal review checklist confirms all sections present and substantive

**ASSUMPTION:** The RFP Section 8.5 does not prescribe exact formatting; narrative structure is inferred from standard commercial proposal practice and Addenda guidance. **Status of this assumption:** TBD -- requires confirmation by review of the full RFP Section 8.5 text. If Section 8.5 does prescribe formatting, R-01 structure must be revised to match. (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-001)

---

### R-02: Allowances — Site Servicing

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall clearly state that a **cash allowance** for site servicing tie-in costs is included per Addendum 03 Section 1.7, and shall specify:

1. Whether the allowance is a lump-sum contingency or a separate line item
2. The amount of the allowance (TBD pending estimate finalization)
3. That service tie-in design/connection responsibility and costs are covered by the allowance

**Traceability:**
- Source: Addendum 03, Section 1.7 (site servicing tie-in cash allowance permitted)

**Status:** Amount TBD; placeholder text required pending estimator input.

---

### R-03: Allowances — FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment)

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall clearly document that:

1. **FF&E is NOT included in the base proposal cost** per Addendum 03 Section 1.18
2. **FF&E is offered as Additional Option 6** with a $20,000 cash allowance
3. The allowance covers furniture, fixtures, and equipment as defined in the RFP/Addendum 03
4. Cross-reference to Schedule A line 1-7 (Additional Option 6) and Schedule B Additional Item 6

**Traceability:**
- Source: Addendum 03 Section 1.18; DEC-012 (Open Issues resolution OI-002, CLOSED)
- Related SOW: SOW-0030
- Verification: Schedule A and Schedule B must show FF&E as separate optional item with $20,000 allowance

**Status:** Validated; $20,000 amount is fixed per DEC-012.

---

### R-04: Exclusions — Pickled Sand Storage Building

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall state clearly that:

1. The **Pickled Sand Storage building is excluded** from this proposal scope per Addendum 03 Section 1.2
2. This building is subject to a separate future RFP
3. No cost allowance or contingency is included for pickled sand infrastructure

**Traceability:**

- Related SOW: SOW-0030
- Verification: Schedule A and B do not include geotechnical investigation line item

**Status:** Validated; confirmed exclusion per DEC-013.

---

### R-06: Insurance & Bonding Cost Inclusion Statement

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall include an explicit statement confirming:

1. **CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) costs are included** in the proposal price per DEC-011 (OI-003, CLOSED)
   - The Design-Builder will arrange and carry all project insurance per Appendix J (Supplementary Conditions)
   - Cost provision is embedded in the proposal total

   - Performance Bond: 50% of Contract Price
   - Labour & Materials Bond: 50% of Contract Price
   - References DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance Evidence) for supporting documentation per RFP 5.3.1 and Appendix H

**Traceability:**
- Source: DEC-011 (OI-003); RFP Sections 5.3.1, 9.14 (CCIP/OCIP decision); Appendix J
- Related SOW: SOW-0030
- Verification: Schedule A total and DEL-01-03 documentation must align; bonding cost statement is part of narrative package

**Status:** Decision confirmed; CCIP is chosen approach per DEC-011.

---

### R-07: Value Optimization Alternatives — Separation & Compliance

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall include a section listing value optimization alternatives (per RFP Section 8.5) that:

2. **Do not undermine base compliance** with mandatory requirements (SOW-0031 constraint)
3. Include brief description of each alternative and its estimated cost or value impact
4. Are clearly labeled as optional/additional items, not base scope

**Traceability:**
- Source: RFP Section 8.5; SOW-0031 (Value alternatives listed separately); Decomposition Section 5
- Related SOW: SOW-0031
- Verification: Alternatives are documented in narrative; Schedule A clearly segregates them from base price

**ASSUMPTION:** RFP Section 8.5 reference to "value alternatives" implies Design-Builder may suggest cost-saving or value-added options; these must be documented transparently without modifying base compliance.

**Status:** Content TBD pending design/estimate finalization; narrative structure required.

---

### R-08: Cross-Document Consistency — Alignment with Schedules A & B

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall maintain internal consistency with:

1. **Schedule A (DEL-01-04: Pricing Summary):** All narrative allowances and exclusions must be traceable to Schedule A line items or explicitly called out as excluded items
2. **Schedule B (DEL-01-05: Cost Breakdown):** Narrative assumptions must align with Schedule B detail (labor/material bases, contingencies, etc.)
3. **DEL-01-03 (Bonding and Insurance):** Bonding cost statements in narrative must reference supporting insurance/bonding evidence

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall explain how the proposal pricing reflects each applicable Addendum:

1. **Addendum 01** (Jul 11, 2024): Missing dimensions are intentional per Addendum 01 clarification; **cost implications: TBD -- Estimator to confirm whether missing dimensions result in any cost variance or additional design contingency**. If no cost implications exist, the narrative shall state "No cost impact from Addendum 01." (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-003)
2. **Addendum 02** (Jul 15, 2024): No cost impact (formatting clarification only)
3. **Addendum 03** (Jul 31, 2024): Major cost impacts (site servicing allowance, FF&E as optional item, pickled sand exclusion, geotechnical scope clarification, CCIP costs, bond statement)

**Traceability:**
- Source: Decomposition Section 4 (Addenda Integration Summary); RFP and Addenda documents
- Related SOW: SOW-0030
- Verification: Each major Addendum impact is addressed in narrative; pricing alignment confirmed in Pass 2

**Status:** Partial TBD pending estimate finalization for Add 01 cost impacts.

---

### R-10: Responsible Party Accountability

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall identify the Estimator/PM responsible for assumptions and cost methodology, supporting auditability and owner follow-up if needed.

**Traceability:**
- Source: CCDC 14-2013 transparency requirements; commercial proposal practice
- Verification: Signature/authorization line in narrative document

**Status:** TBD pending document finalization.

---

### R-11: Addenda Acknowledgement Line Completion (Disqualification Risk)

**Requirement:** The Appendix H submission shall include a completed addenda acknowledgement line for each applicable Addendum (01, 02, 03). This is a **mandatory mechanical step** separate from R-09 (narrative discussion of addenda impacts).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Each Addendum number is listed on the acknowledgement line
2. The acknowledgement line is signed/initialed by the authorized representative
3. All three Addenda are acknowledged (failure to acknowledge any addendum may disqualify the price proposal)

**Traceability:**
- Source: RFP Section 2.9; Appendix H acknowledgement requirements; Decomposition §3, C-07
- Risk: Datasheet Conditions notes "failure may disqualify price proposal"
- Verification: Visual inspection of completed Appendix H acknowledgement section

**Status:** Acknowledgement line completion required; procedural step to be confirmed. (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md X-003, A-002)

---

### R-12: Final Reviewer Authority & Estimate Readiness Threshold

**Requirement:** The pricing narrative shall not proceed to final review (Procedure Step 11) until:

1. **Final Reviewer role is assigned:** The Proposal Lead/Project Manager who will provide final sign-off is identified by name and title. **ASSUMPTION:** The Final Reviewer has authority to approve narrative content for submission; this authority should be confirmed by proposal governance. (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md D-001)

2. **Schedule B readiness threshold is met:** Schedule B (DEL-01-05) shall be at least 80% complete before narrative authoring proceeds beyond placeholder stage. **Definition of 80% complete:** TBD -- Estimator and Proposal Manager to define measurable criteria (e.g., percentage of line items with confirmed values, all major cost categories populated). (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md X-002)

**Traceability:**
- Source: Procedure Step 11 (Final Reviewer reference); Procedure P-02 (80% threshold reference)
- Verification: Proposal Manager confirms both criteria are met before scheduling final review

**Status:** TBD pending governance confirmation and threshold definition.
