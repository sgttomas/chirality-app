# Guidance — DEL-01-06: Pricing Narrative and Assumptions

## Purpose

DEL-01-06 exists to accomplish three strategic objectives in the proposal submission:

1. **Transparency & Trust:** Demonstrate to the Town of Penhold that the Design-Builder has carefully considered all cost drivers, scope boundaries, and assumptions, and has articulated them clearly. A well-reasoned pricing narrative signals professional competence and builds confidence in the cost estimate.

2. **Compliance & Risk Management:** Clearly document how the proposal addresses each Addendum and resolves known ambiguities (FF&E treatment, CCIP insurance, geotechnical scope). This prevents misinterpretation of the proposal and reduces post-award disputes over scope/cost boundaries.

3. **Competitive Positioning:** Position the design-builder as thorough, transparent, and value-conscious. The narrative frame and tone convey whether the proponent is rushing, cutting corners, or thoughtfully optimizing. Value alternatives, in particular, signal a willingness to offer options rather than a take-it-or-leave-it posture.

**Supporting Objective (from Decomposition):**
- **OBJ-007:** Produce a competitive, compliant price package. DEL-01-06 directly supports this by providing the narrative foundation for the price submission.

---

## Principles

### P-01: Traceability Over Interpretation

**Principle:** Every major cost assumption, allowance, or exclusion shall be traceable to an authoritative source (RFP, Addendum, decomposition decision log). Do not invent or extrapolate.

**Rationale:**
- The Town's evaluation committee will scrutinize the narrative for consistency with its RFP intent.
- Unsubstantiated claims ("we've optimized the approach") weaken credibility.
- Transparent traceability shows the Design-Builder understands the RFP and has not made unauthorized scope changes.

**Implication for Writing:**
- Always cite the source when explaining an assumption.
- Use phrases like "per Addendum 03," "per RFP Section X.Y," or "per DEC-012 (Open Issues resolution)."
- If an assumption is reasonable inference, label it as such: "ASSUMPTION: [statement]."

---

### P-02: Cost Honesty Over Aggressive Discounting

**Principle:** Present realistic cost assumptions based on market data, labor rates, and material bases current at the time of proposal. Avoid "loss leader" pricing that cannot be sustained in delivery.

**Rationale:**
- The Town is evaluating both technical merit (65 points) and price (35 points).
- An artificially low price may win the award but create unsustainable project conditions, leading to change orders, disputes, or poor quality delivery.
- A transparent, justified cost estimate builds credibility with the Town's project team (who must live with the Design-Builder for years post-award).

**Implication for Assumptions:**
- Document the labor rate basis (e.g., "Alberta prevailing wage rates, January 2024 data").
- Disclose material cost date ("material quotes dated August 2024").
- If escalation is applied, show the logic clearly ("2% annual escalation applied to account for inflation through project delivery period TBD").

---

### P-03: Allowance Clarity Over Ambiguity

**Principle:** When an allowance is used (site servicing, FF&E), state explicitly:
- What is covered (scope boundary)
- How much the allowance is
- Who bears the risk if actual costs exceed the allowance
- Whether the allowance is a cost contingency or a design/construction cost

**Rationale:**
- Addendum 03 introduces flexibility (site servicing cash allowance permitted; FF&E as optional item), but this flexibility must be explained to avoid misunderstanding.
- The Town will ask: "Does your $X allowance cover all servicing tie-ins, or will we have surprises?"
- Clear allowance framing is essential to the proposal's credibility.

**Implication for Narrative:**
- Use a table: Allowance, Scope Covered, Amount, Risk Boundary, Verification Method.
- For site servicing, explain: Is it a contingency for unknown tie-in costs, or a design fee for professional tie-in services? (TBD pending estimator input.)
- For FF&E $20,000: Clearly state what is in scope (e.g., "basic operational furnishings for main offices, break rooms, training areas") and what is not (e.g., "specialized apparatus bay fixtures beyond standard design").

---

### P-04: Exclusions Clarity Over Silence

**Principle:** State explicitly what is NOT included in the base proposal cost. Silence creates ambiguity and risk of disputes.

**Rationale:**
- The Town will assume that if something is not mentioned as excluded, it is included.
- Pickled sand storage (Addendum 03) and additional geotechnical investigation (DEC-013) are known exclusions; the narrative must call them out clearly.
- Omission of a clear exclusion statement is worse than calling out an exclusion and having the Town ask clarifying questions.

**Implication for Narrative:**
- Dedicate a section to "Exclusions and Clarifications."
- Use strong language: "The following items are explicitly excluded from the base proposal cost: [list]."
- For each exclusion, cite the source (RFP, Addendum, decision log) and briefly explain why it is excluded.

---

### P-05: Insurance & Bonding Explicitness Over Assumption

**Principle:** The narrative shall explicitly state that CCIP costs and bonding costs are included in the proposal total. Do not assume the Town will infer this.

**Rationale:**
- RFP Section 9.14 allows the Design-Builder to choose OCIP or CCIP; this is a major cost variable.
- RFP 5.3.1 requires bonds; the cost of these bonds is a significant line item.
- Failure to disclose that these costs are included in the price can lead to disputes post-award.
- Explicit disclosure is a best-practice signal of professional proposal development.

**Implication for Narrative:**
- Include a standalone section: "Insurance and Bonding Costs."
- State: "Contractor Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP) costs, as permitted under RFP Section 9.14, are included in the proposal price. The Design-Builder will arrange and carry all project insurance per Appendix J (Supplementary Conditions). [Reference DEC-011 for decision authority.]"
- State: "Performance Bond (50% of Contract Price) and Labour & Materials Bond (50% of Contract Price) costs are included in the proposal price per RFP 5.3.1. [Reference DEL-01-03 for supporting bonding documentation.]"

---

### P-06: Value Alternatives as Differentiation, Not Base Scope Inflation

**Principle:** Value alternatives are optional suggestions that differentiate the Design-Builder's approach and demonstrate value consciousness. They are NOT part of the base proposal cost and must be clearly separated.

**Rationale:**
- RFP Section 8.5 invites value alternatives; the Town is open to ideas.
- Proposers who suggest thoughtful alternatives (e.g., "energy-efficient HVAC with payback in X years") demonstrate deeper engagement.
- However, alternatives must not undermine the base compliance posture (SOW-0031 constraint).
- Separation is critical: if alternatives inflate the base cost or appear to be creative scope-creep, they weaken, not strengthen, the proposal.

**Implication for Narrative:**
- Create a separate section: "Value Optimization Alternatives."
- For each alternative, use a consistent template: Alternative Title | Description | Cost/Value Impact | Compliance Status (Does it keep the base proposal compliant? Or is it truly optional?)
- Examples of compliant value alternatives:
  - "Enhanced insulation package: +$50K; reduces operational utility costs by ~$15K annually over 20 years; maintains all mandatory requirements."
  - "Phased solar installation capability: $0 in base cost; solar-ready roof design included at no premium per Addendum 03; future owner can add panels independently."
  - "Advanced BMS (Building Management System): +$35K; improves operational efficiency; optional upgrade to base design."
- Examples of non-compliant value alternatives (DO NOT INCLUDE):
  - "We can reduce the apparatus bays from 2200 sf to 1800 sf and save $40K." (Violates minimum code/RFP space requirements; undermines base compliance.)

---

## Considerations

### C-01: Cost Estimate Maturity & Timing

**Issue:** DEL-01-06 narrative is written while the detailed estimate (DEL-01-05: Schedule B) may still be in refinement.

**Guidance:**
- Use placeholder language where specific numbers are not yet final: "Site servicing allowance (amount TBD pending estimator review)" or "Additional geotechnical investigation: no allowance (per DEC-013)."
- The narrative should be written in two passes:
  1. **First Pass (Concept):** Structure, assumptions, principles, allowances/exclusions logic.
  2. **Second Pass (Post-Estimate):** Fill in specific dollar amounts, labor rate dates, material cost bases.
- Schedule A and B are the source of truth for pricing details; the narrative is the explanation of those details.

---

### C-02: Addendum 03 Scope Ambiguities & Design Implications

**Issue:** Addendum 03 introduces multiple scope clarifications (site servicing allowance, FF&E optional, room sizing ranges, etc.) that affect pricing and create design trade-offs.

**Guidance:**
- The narrative is NOT the place to rehash all Addendum 03 details; instead, summarize key pricing impacts and reference the RFP/Addendum for details.
- Focus on the cost implications: "Addendum 03 clarified that site servicing tie-in costs may be covered by a cash allowance; the Design-Builder has allocated [amount TBD] for this purpose. Design team will coordinate with the Town on tie-in connection points and responsibilities."
- For room sizing ranges (e.g., apparatus bays 2000–2200 sf): The narrative does not need to defend the chosen room size; that is a design decision (DEL-02-01 or DEL-02-02). The narrative simply notes: "Apparatus bay sizing per Addendum 03 ranges; design proposal at [chosen size] sf within this range."

---

### C-03: FF&E as Additional Option vs. Base Scope

**Issue:** Addendum 03 Section 1.18 explicitly excludes FF&E from base cost but allows it as an optional item. DEC-012 resolved this as "Additional Option 6" with $20,000 allowance.

**Guidance:**
- The narrative must state clearly: "Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment (FF&E) are NOT included in the base proposal cost per Addendum 03 Section 1.18. The Design-Builder offers FF&E as Additional Option 6 with a $20,000 cash allowance, covering [specific items: TBD]."
- Schedule A must show this as a separate line item at the end, OUTSIDE the base price total.
- Schedule B must show Additional Item 6 with detail.
- This is a potential competitive advantage if articulated well: "The Design-Builder's base cost focuses on structural, mechanical, and operational systems. FF&E is optional, allowing the Town to budget it separately or defer if needed."

---

### C-04: Geotechnical Investigation Scope & Design Confidence

**Issue:** DEC-013 confirms no additional geotechnical investigation, relying on the existing 2021 report. This is a cost-saving decision but may create design risk if the 2021 report is incomplete.

**Guidance:**
- The narrative should state: "Foundation design and site assessment rely on the existing 2021 geotechnical investigation report provided in RFP Appendix D. No allowance for additional geotechnical work is included per DEC-013. [If needed: The Design-Builder will flag any site conditions that warrant supplemental investigation during the detailed design phase, to be addressed through change order procedures.]"
- Avoid over-promising confidence in the 2021 report if the design team has concerns; instead, note: "The 2021 report provides the foundation for initial design; any areas requiring supplemental investigation will be identified during design development."
- This is an area where the narrative, spec, and design teams must align to avoid post-award surprises.

---

### C-05: CCIP Cost Allocation & Insurance Transparency

**Issue:** DEC-011 confirms CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) is the chosen insurance approach. CCIP costs are embedded in the proposal total, but may not be a visible line item.

**Guidance:**
- The narrative should explain: "Per RFP Section 9.14 and DEC-011, the Design-Builder has elected Contractor Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP) structure. All project insurance costs—including general liability, builders risk, workers compensation on-site costs, and other coverages per Appendix J—are included in the proposal price total. [Reference DEL-01-03 for insurance certificate/coverage details.]"
- Insurance costs are typically absorbed in the general conditions or profit margin; the narrative does not need to break out a specific insurance line item unless required by the RFP.
- This is a compliance and transparency issue: failure to disclose CCIP inclusion can lead to claims post-award.

---

### C-06: Value Alternatives & Compliance Risk

**Issue:** Value alternatives can enhance the proposal's appeal, but if they inadvertently suggest scope reductions or non-compliance, they backfire.

**Guidance:**
- Screen all proposed alternatives against the mandatory requirements in RFP Section 6 and Addendum 03 clarifications.
- Compliant alternatives often involve:
  - Enhanced systems (insulation, BMS, solar-readiness) that exceed minimum code
  - Operational cost reductions (energy efficiency) that don't reduce scope
  - Schedule flexibility or phasing options
  - Materials/finishes upgrades
- Non-compliant alternatives often involve:
  - Space reductions (violating minimum room size requirements)
  - System deletions (violating code or program requirements)
  - Deferred deliverables (implying the base proposal is incomplete)
- **SOW-0031 constraint:** "Value alternatives must not undermine base compliance." Screen ruthlessly.

---

### C-07: Value Alternatives Selection Criteria & Prioritization

**Issue:** P-06 and C-06 describe compliance screening (compliant vs. non-compliant) but do not guide how many alternatives to include or how to prioritize among multiple compliant options.

**Guidance:**
- **Quantity:** TBD -- the Proposal Manager and Design Lead should determine the appropriate number of value alternatives based on (a) strength of the cost/value proposition, (b) relevance to the Town's stated priorities, and (c) narrative page budget (see T-01). **ASSUMPTION:** 3--5 well-developed alternatives are typical for proposals of this scale, but the optimal number depends on quality over quantity.
- **Prioritization criteria for compliant alternatives:**
  1. **Alignment with Owner priorities:** Does the alternative address a stated Town concern (operational cost, sustainability, flexibility)?
  2. **Strength of cost/value case:** Is the cost impact quantifiable and the benefit clearly articulated?
  3. **Feasibility confidence:** Can the Design-Builder deliver the alternative within the project constraints?
  4. **Differentiation potential:** Does the alternative distinguish the proposal from likely competitors?
- **Decision authority:** Proposal Manager and Design Lead jointly select final alternatives list; Estimator confirms cost impact accuracy.

## Trade-offs

### T-01: Narrative Depth vs. Brevity

**Trade-off:** How much detail should the pricing narrative provide?

**Options:**
- **High Detail:** Extensive explanation of every assumption, cost driver, and Addendum impact; builds confidence but risks being verbose (5–7 pages).
- **Balanced:** Summary-level explanation of major assumptions and Addendum impacts; references Schedule B for detail; typical commercial proposal format (3–4 pages).
- **Brief:** One-page executive summary with references to Schedules A/B; minimal narrative; efficient but risks appearing less thorough.

**Recommendation:** Balanced approach (3–4 pages). The proposal's technical sections (Sections 6–7) are the primary scored content; the pricing narrative is supporting material. Focus on clarity, traceability, and compliance; avoid redundancy with Schedules A/B.

---

### T-02: Conservative Assumptions vs. Competitive Pricing

**Trade-off:** Should cost assumptions include contingencies, or push for aggressive pricing to win?

**Options:**
- **Conservative:** Include contingencies for labor/material inflation, scope ambiguity, and design unknowns; higher price but lower delivery risk.
- **Aggressive:** Minimal contingency; assume-best-case labor/material costs and efficiency; lower price but higher delivery risk.
- **Balanced:** Standard industry contingencies (5--10% on labor, 3--5% on materials, as appropriate) based on project phase and risk profile; transparent about contingency allocation in narrative. **Note:** These ranges are stated as general industry practice; **source citation is TBD** -- the Estimator should confirm these ranges against an authoritative industry reference (e.g., AACE International Recommended Practice, RSMeans, or equivalent Alberta construction industry guidance) and cite the source in the final narrative. Without a cited source, the contingency percentage lacks defensibility for evaluation committee review. (Ref: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md C-002)

**Recommendation:** Balanced approach. Document the contingency logic in the narrative: "A [X]% contingency is allocated for labor cost inflation and design development uncertainties, consistent with industry practice for a project at this phase of definition." Transparency builds confidence more than false economy.

---

### T-03: Allowance Amounts (Lump-Sum vs. Itemized)

**Trade-off:** Should site servicing and FF&E allowances be lump-sum numbers or broken into itemized detail?

**Options:**
- **Lump-Sum:** Single allowance amount (e.g., "Site servicing allowance: $TBD"); simple, reduces proposal detail; risks Town skepticism ("how did they arrive at that number?").
- **Itemized:** Breakdown of allowance by service type (e.g., Water: $X; Sewer: $Y; Electrical: $Z); detailed, transparent; may be premature if design is not far enough along.
- **Staged:** Lump-sum in the proposal with itemized backup in Schedule B detail; balances simplicity and transparency.

**Recommendation:** For site servicing: Staged approach. The narrative states "Site servicing allowance: $[TBD]" with a note that Schedule B provides itemized breakdown by service type (water, sewer, electrical, gas, communications, etc.). This allows the narrative to remain concise while supporting detail is available for review.
For FF&E: The narrative clearly states "$20,000 allowance" (fixed per DEC-012) and Schedule B/Narrative list what is covered (e.g., "office furnishings, break room equipment, training aids, communication systems, TBD specifics pending design finalization").

## Examples

### Example: Pricing Narrative Opening Section

**Title: Pricing Philosophy and Overview**

"The Design-Builder's proposal cost reflects a comprehensive Design-Build delivery for the Public Services Building per CCDC 14-2013 terms. The cost estimate is based on [current market labor rates as of August 2024, material quotes dated August 2024, Alberta prevailing wage assumptions per [reference], and a [X]% contingency for design development and scope clarification]. This narrative clarifies major cost assumptions, allowances, exclusions, and insurance/bonding treatment to ensure transparency and alignment with RFP requirements and applicable Addenda.

**Source:** RFP Section 8.5 (Pricing narrative content); Addendum 03 (scope clarifications affecting pricing).

---

### Example: Allowances Section

**Title: Cost Allowances and Contingencies**

**Site Servicing Tie-In Allowance**
Addendum 03 Section 1.7 permits a cash allowance for site servicing tie-in costs. The Design-Builder has allocated $[TBD] to cover the connection of water, sewer, electrical, gas, and communications services from the site boundary to the building. This allowance covers:
- Geotechnical survey and tie-in design coordination
- Trenching and conduit installation
- Connection hardware and testing
- Contingency for minor scope adjustments

The Town is responsible for confirming utility service availability and connection point locations with the respective service providers; the Design-Builder will coordinate design accordingly. If actual tie-in costs exceed the allowance, changes will be processed per contract change order procedures.

**FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment) Additional Option**
Per Addendum 03 Section 1.18, FF&E is NOT included in the base proposal cost. The Design-Builder offers FF&E as Additional Option 6 with a $20,000 allowance, covering [basic operational furnishings: administrative office furniture, break room equipment, training room tables/chairs, fire station common area furnishings, and operational equipment racks for IT and communications systems]. Specialized apparatus bay fixtures, kitchen commercial equipment (if beyond code minimum), and any items not expressly listed are not included in the $20,000 allowance and would be subject to change order pricing.

**Contingency (General)**
A [X]% contingency is allocated within the base proposal cost to account for [labor cost inflation to project delivery date, design development uncertainties, minor scope clarifications]. This contingency is NOT a change order reserve; it is part of the base estimated cost.

**Source:** Addendum 03, Sections 1.7 and 1.18; DEC-012, DEC-013 (Open Issues resolutions).

---

### Example: Exclusions Section

**Title: Exclusions and Clarifications**

The following items are explicitly excluded from the base proposal cost:

1. **Pickled Sand Storage Building:** Per Addendum 03 Section 1.2, the Pickled Sand Storage building is excluded from this RFP and will be the subject of a separate future RFP. No cost allowance or contingency for pickled sand infrastructure is included.

2. **Additional Geotechnical Investigation:** Per DEC-013 and Addendum 03, foundation design and site assessment rely on the existing 2021 geotechnical investigation report provided in RFP Appendix D. No allowance for supplemental geotechnical investigation is included in the proposal. If during detailed design the Design-Builder identifies site conditions requiring additional investigation, this will be addressed through change order procedures.

3. **Owner Services & Utilities:** Utility connection to the site boundary is the Owner's responsibility. The Design-Builder's scope is limited to tie-in connections per the site servicing allowance noted above.

**Source:** Addendum 03, RFP Section 6 (Scope Definition); DEC-012, DEC-013 (Open Issues resolutions).

---

### Example: Value Alternatives Section

**Title: Value Optimization Alternatives**

The Design-Builder offers the following optional alternatives for the Town's consideration. These are NOT included in the base proposal cost and do NOT modify the base compliance posture:

| **Alternative** | **Description** | **Cost/Value Impact** | **Compliance Status** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Enhanced Insulation Package** | Upgrade wall/roof insulation to exceed code minimum; reduces long-term utility costs. | +$50,000 base cost; ~$15,000 annual energy savings over 20-year lifecycle. | Maintains all mandatory requirements; full compliance. |
| **Solar-Ready Roof** | Roof design and structural capacity for future solar panel installation. | $0 additional cost in base proposal (per Addendum 03 solar-capable roofing requirement); future owner retrofits independently. | Maintains all mandatory requirements; meets solar-capable requirement as base scope. |
| **Advanced Building Management System (BMS)** | Computerized facility automation (HVAC, lighting, security integration). | +$35,000 base cost. | Optional enhancement; base design includes manual/standard controls per code minimum. Maintains all mandatory requirements. |

**Source:** RFP Section 8.5 (Value alternatives); SOW-0031 (Value alternatives listed separately, no undermining of base compliance).

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

Pass 3 (Semantic Lensing) identified the following items requiring human clarification. These are not contradictions between existing documents but ambiguities that need resolution before the narrative is finalized.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CT-001 | **Tax treatment scope:** Datasheet lists "Currency / taxes treatment" as an attribute noting "Taxes shown separately from base contract amounts in Appendix H." No other document addresses tax treatment in the narrative context. Is tax treatment a narrative concern or solely a Schedule A/B formatting concern (Appendix H template)? | Datasheet.md, Attributes table, "Currency / taxes treatment" row | Specification.md (silent on tax treatment); Guidance/Procedure (silent) | Datasheet Attributes; potentially Specification R-01 (narrative structure) | Proposal Manager -- confirm whether narrative must address tax treatment or if Appendix H formatting is sufficient | TBD |
| CT-002 | **Owner Services & Utilities exclusion scope:** Guidance Examples section lists "Owner Services & Utilities: Utility connection to the site boundary is the Owner's responsibility" as a third exclusion beyond pickled sand (R-04) and geotechnical (R-05). This exclusion is not mentioned in Specification R-04/R-05 or Datasheet. Is this an intended additional exclusion requiring a new Specification requirement (R-XX), or an example artifact that should not be treated as a committed exclusion? | Guidance.md, Examples, Exclusions Section (item 3) | Specification.md, R-04 and R-05 (only two exclusions defined); Datasheet.md, Attributes/Conditions (silent on Owner Services exclusion) | Specification Requirements; Datasheet Attributes; Guidance Examples | Estimator / Proposal Manager -- confirm whether "Owner Services & Utilities" is a formal exclusion or an illustrative example | TBD |

**Note:** If detailed estimate finalization introduces dollar amounts that conflict with any narrative statement, or if design changes affect the scope of the site servicing allowance or FF&E definition, this Conflict Table should be updated and submitted for human ruling before the proposal narrative is finalized.
