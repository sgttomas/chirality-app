# Procedure: Detailed Design and Construction Documents Plan

## Purpose

This procedure guides the Design Manager through two distinct activities:

1. **Producing DEL-06-02 (proposal stage):** Writing the Design Documents Plan Narrative as a proposal section that responds to RFP §7.1.8, ready for inclusion in the formal submission package.
2. **Executing the plan (post-award):** Managing the five design submission milestones, discipline deliverables, QA/QC checkpoints, and Owner review cycles through to the 100% IFC Detailed Design Package (full package).

The proposal-stage document must be compelling enough to score well under the Design Methodology evaluation criterion (3 pts of 10-pt Project Delivery Plan score, OBJ-002).

## Prerequisites

### References Required Before Writing

| Reference | Why Needed | Access Status |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| RFP §7.1.8 (p.18) | Defines the five milestones, Design Brief requirement, review and resubmission obligation — these are the normative requirements | Accessible |
| RFP §7.2 (pp.19–20) | Document format standards (NMS), professional seal requirement, QA/QC obligations | Accessible |
| RFP §7.3 (p.20) | Owner and PM document access requirements | Accessible |
| DEL-06-01 Design Methodology Narrative | Overall design process context; milestone descriptions must be consistent with design methodology | Cross-reference |
| DEL-09-01 Detailed Project Schedule | Milestone dates; the schedule references this plan's milestones — they must align | Cross-reference |
| DEL-07-05 Quality Management Narrative | QA/QC checkpoint framework; this plan's checkpoints must be consistent | Cross-reference |

### Upstream Dependencies (Declared)

None declared critical (see _DEPENDENCIES.md). However, practical drafting depends on:
- The Design-Builder's proposed project schedule being sufficiently drafted to confirm milestone date sequence
- The discipline team structure being confirmed (who is responsible for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil deliverables)

---

## Steps

### Phase A: Drafting the Proposal Section (Pre-Submission)

**Step A1 — Extract RFP §7.1.8 Requirements**

Read RFP §7.1.8 (p.18) and confirm the five design submission milestones verbatim:
1. Building Design Development
2. 60% Detailed Design review
3. Foundation Issued for Construction (if needed)
4. 100% Building Detail Design
5. 100% IFC Detailed Design Package (full package)

Also note the two additional obligations:
- Design-Builder submits a Design Brief with the proposal
- Each milestone must include time for review and resubmission

Record: Milestone list and obligations confirmed.

**Step A2 — Determine Whether Foundation IFC Will Be Used**

Consult the proposed project schedule (DEL-09-01). If an early foundation start is planned to compress the construction schedule, include Foundation IFC as an active milestone. If not, include it as a conditional milestone ("will be activated if the construction schedule requires an early foundation start").

Record: Foundation IFC treatment decision (active or conditional).

**Step A3 — Draft the Milestone Matrix**

For each of the five milestones, define:
- Purpose and design completion level (e.g., 60% = drawings at 50% detail with all major systems located)
- Discipline deliverables: at a minimum, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical/IT
- Estimated target date (consistent with DEL-09-01)
- Owner review window (recommended: 10 business days for review; 5 business days for resubmission resolution)
- QA/QC checkpoint: internal review completed before submission

Refer to Guidance EX-001 (Design Submission Milestone Matrix) as a starting template.

Record: Milestone matrix for inclusion in narrative.

**Step A4 — Draft the Discipline Deliverables Section**

Describe what each discipline will provide at each milestone. Consider the specific project scope:
- Architectural: building envelope, interior finishes, layout, accessibility compliance, 40 bunker gear lockers (Addendum 03)
- Structural: foundation, frame, 50-year design life main building / 20-year Cold Storage
- Mechanical: HVAC including apparatus bay exhaust, bay sumps, 2" water fill stations
- Electrical/IT: power, lighting, controls, communications, solar-ready rough-ins (Addendum 03)
- Civil: site grading, utilities, drainage on 12-acre site

**Source:** Addendum 03 special requirements; RFP Appendix A OSR; _CONTEXT.md project description.

Record: Discipline deliverables section for narrative.

**Step A5 — Draft the Coordination Approach**

Describe how disciplines are coordinated across milestones:
- Who leads design coordination (Design Manager)
- How inter-discipline conflicts are identified (coordination meetings, drawing overlay review, BIM if applicable)
- How conflicts are resolved and documented
- How the Owner is informed of coordination issues that require a design direction decision

Record: Coordination approach narrative.

**Step A6 — Draft the Owner Review and Approval Cycle Description**

For each milestone, describe:
- How the submission package is delivered to the Owner and Project Manager (and any Owner-retained consultants)
- The review timeline (stated in business days)
- What triggers progression to the next stage (written Owner approval or conditional approval)
- How resubmissions are handled

Refer to Guidance EX-002 (recommended Owner review cycle language).

Record: Owner review cycle description for narrative.

**Step A7 — Draft the QA/QC Checkpoints Section**

For each milestone, describe the internal QA/QC gate:
- Internal discipline peer review
- Inter-discipline coordination review (clash check)
- Design Manager QC sign-off before submission

Note cross-reference to DEL-07-05 for detailed quality management procedures.

Refer to Guidance EX-003 (60% review QA/QC checkpoint example).

Record: QA/QC checkpoints section for narrative.

**Step A8 — Draft the Document Standards Declaration**

State:
- All documents will be formatted, titled, and numbered per a standard agreed with the Owner and Project Manager
- NMS format will be followed for specifications (as recommended by RFP §7.2)
- All planning, design, and construction documents will be sealed by an Alberta-registered professional Architect/Engineer

Record: Document standards section for narrative.

**Step A9 — Assemble and Review the Narrative**

Compile Steps A3–A8 into a coherent narrative section. Apply these authoring checks:

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| All five milestones named? | Yes — verbatim from RFP §7.1.8 |
| Review and resubmission time addressed at each milestone? | Yes |
| Design Brief mentioned as proposal deliverable? | Yes |
| All discipline deliverables matrix included? | Yes |
| Coordination approach described? | Yes |
| Owner review cycle described? | Yes |
| QA/QC checkpoints stated? | Yes |
| Document format standard declared? | Yes |
| Professional seal obligation stated? | Yes |
| Milestone dates consistent with DEL-09-01? | Cross-check required |
| QA/QC checkpoints consistent with DEL-07-05? | Cross-check required |

**Step A10 — Cross-Document Consistency Checks**

Before finalizing the narrative:

1. Compare milestone dates in this narrative against DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule). Correct any inconsistencies.
2. Compare QA/QC checkpoint descriptions against DEL-07-05 (Quality Management Narrative). Ensure language is consistent and responsibilities do not overlap or conflict.
3. Confirm terminology (milestone names, discipline names, Owner review terminology) is consistent with DEL-06-01 (Design Methodology Narrative).

Record: Cross-check completion noted; any conflicts escalated to Conflict Table in Guidance.md.

### Phase B: Post-Award Plan Execution

**Step B1 — Confirm and Baseline the Milestone Schedule**

Within 20 calendar days of contract award (consistent with schedule control requirement, RFP §7.2), confirm the five milestone dates with the Owner and Project Manager. Incorporate into the baseline project schedule (DEL-09-01).

Record: Baseline milestone dates agreed in writing with Owner/PM.

**Step B2 — Establish Design Team and Discipline Leads**

Confirm which firm and individual is responsible for each design discipline. Establish design coordination protocol (meeting cadence, coordination platform, file management system).

Record: Discipline lead contact list; document management system set up.

**Step B3 — Execute Each Milestone Cycle**

For each of the five milestones (repeated per milestone):

| Sub-step | Action | Record |
|----------|--------|--------|
| B3.1 | Design team produces deliverables per discipline matrix for this milestone | Drawings, specifications, schedules completed |
| B3.2 | Each discipline lead self-reviews and certifies completeness | Discipline sign-off sheets |
| B3.3 | Coordination review held: inter-discipline clashes identified and resolved | Coordination meeting minutes; clash resolution log |
| B3.4 | Design Manager performs QC review and signs off | QC sign-off checklist |
| B3.5 | Submission package compiled with transmittal letter (documents listed, dated, revision-numbered) | Transmittal letter filed |
| B3.6 | Package submitted to Owner, PM, and applicable Owner-retained consultants | Submission date recorded |
| B3.7 | Owner review conducted per agreed timeline | Owner review comments received |
| B3.8 | Comments addressed; resubmission issued if required | Resubmission transmittal filed |
| B3.9 | Owner written approval or conditional approval received | Approval letter on file |

**Step B3A — Design Process Audit and Lessons Learned**

After completion of the 60% Detailed Design Review and again after the 100% IFC Detailed Design Package (full package), the Design Manager shall convene a brief design process review to capture lessons learned and identify process improvements:

1. Assess whether the coordination approach, QC checkpoint cadence, and Owner review cycle worked as planned for the completed milestone
2. Document any process bottlenecks, missed coordination issues, or review cycle delays
3. Identify corrective actions for subsequent milestones (e.g., earlier coordination meetings, adjusted review timelines, additional discipline checkpoints)
4. Record lessons learned in a running log accessible to the design team

This step ensures continuous improvement in the design management process across milestone cycles, rather than deferring all process feedback to project closeout. *(Added per semantic lensing item A-003: operative process audit gap.)*

Record: Lessons-learned log entry per milestone; corrective actions documented.

**Step B4 — Manage Design Changes During Design Phase**

When design changes are identified (Owner-initiated, regulatory, value engineering, or coordination-driven):
1. Document the change and its trigger
2. Obtain Owner approval for any scope changes before incorporating into design
3. Update affected drawings and specifications
4. Note change impact on next milestone submission

Record: Design change log (running; updated throughout design phase).

**Step B5 — Transition to Construction Phase**

After 100% IFC Detailed Design Package approval:
1. Compile final sealed drawing and specification set for all disciplines
2. Deliver to construction team with access for the Owner, PM, and Owner-retained consultants (per RFP §7.3)
3. Brief construction team on design intent, critical detailing, and any outstanding design direction items
4. Establish RFI response process and design representative availability during construction

Record: Transition meeting minutes; IFC package manifest.

## Notes

- **Proposal stage:** The immediate output of this deliverable is a narrative proposal section. It should be written to demonstrate design management capability to the evaluation panel, not just to satisfy a checklist. Concrete commitments (stated review windows, named coordination approach, explicit milestone content) score better than general statements.
- **Foundation IFC decision:** Confirm whether an early foundation start is on the proposed project critical path before finalizing milestone treatment.
- **Schedule dependency:** Milestone dates in this narrative must match the Gantt chart in DEL-09-01. Write both deliverables in coordination.
- **QA/QC boundary:** Avoid duplicating DEL-07-05 procedures in detail. State the checkpoint, reference DEL-07-05 for full procedures, and confirm consistency between the two documents before submission.
- **Professional sealing:** Alberta requires all construction documents to be sealed by a registered professional. Confirm which firm holds the Architect of Record role and which holds discipline Engineer of Record roles for each discipline.
