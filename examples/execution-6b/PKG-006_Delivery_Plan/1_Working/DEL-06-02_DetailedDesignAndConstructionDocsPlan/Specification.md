|--------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| R-015 | The plan shall describe how Alberta Building Code compliance is verified at each milestone submission (e.g., code review checklist, AHJ pre-submission consultation, discipline lead code compliance certification). | RFP §7.2 (p.19-20): AHJ conformity obligation; Alberta Building Code (current edition) — not directly reviewed, location TBD. Added per semantic lensing item A-002. | Code compliance verification method stated per milestone |
| R-016 | The design team discipline structure (firms and discipline leads for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical/IT, civil) shall be confirmed as a prerequisite before milestone planning is finalized. | ASSUMPTION: operational foundation requirement inferred from Procedure Prerequisites (design team structure dependency) and multi-discipline coordination requirement R-006. Added per semantic lensing item F-001. | Design team structure confirmed prior to milestone schedule baseline |
| R-017 | The plan shall define measurable acceptance criteria or quality thresholds for milestone submissions (e.g., minimum drawing completion percentage per discipline, specification section coverage) beyond binary QC sign-off. | ASSUMPTION: quality threshold definition inferred from Guidance T-003 ("60% complete" is undefined) and RFP §7.2 QA/QC obligation. Added per semantic lensing item F-002. Quality thresholds TBD — to be proposed by Design Manager. | Acceptance criteria stated per milestone; thresholds are measurable |

### Deliverable Production Requirement
