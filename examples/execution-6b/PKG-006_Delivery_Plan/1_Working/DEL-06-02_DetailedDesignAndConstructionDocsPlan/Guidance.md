# Guidance: Detailed Design and Construction Documents Plan

## Purpose

This deliverable establishes the operational framework for managing design submissions and construction documentation throughout the project lifecycle. The plan serves to:

- Clarify the design development pathway with explicit milestone gates and deliverables, giving the Owner confidence that design is progressing toward a construction-ready state
- Demonstrate a structured Owner-aware design delivery process that scores well under the Design Methodology evaluation criterion (3 pts of the 10-pt Project Delivery Plan score, OBJ-002)
- Establish quality control touchpoints before design is committed to construction, reducing the risk of costly rework
- Coordinate discipline teams across architecture, civil, structural, mechanical, and electrical/IT disciplines to prevent scope gaps and interface conflicts
- Document the formal transition from design documents to construction-ready IFC packages

**Objective Alignment:** OBJ-002 — Maximize Project Delivery Plan score (10 pts). DEL-06-02 is a component of the Design Methodology sub-criterion (3 pts). A strong plan demonstrates that the Design-Builder understands the design development process and has a rigorous, Owner-partnered approach to design governance.

## Principles

### P-001: All Five Milestones Must Be Addressed Explicitly

RFP §7.1.8 lists five distinct design submission milestones. The plan must name and describe all five — not use generic language. Each milestone has a distinct purpose:

- **Building Design Development:** Establishes the design concept and confirms design direction before advancing to detailed documentation.
- **60% Detailed Design Review:** Allows Owner and team to identify coordination issues or scope gaps at mid-stage, while changes are still cost-effective.
- **Foundation IFC (if needed):** Enables early start on foundation construction, accelerating overall project schedule by allowing foundation work to proceed while building design continues.
- **100% Building Detail Design:** Complete, construction-ready building design with full drawings and specifications.
- **100% IFC Detailed Design Package:** Full Issued for Construction package for all systems and disciplines; the authoritative construction document set.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 (p.18), verbatim milestone list.

### P-002: Review and Resubmission Time Is Explicitly Required

RFP §7.1.8 states that milestones must include "time for review and resubmission." This is not optional — the plan must show that Owner review is built into the timeline at each milestone. A plan that presents milestones as sequential design events without Owner review windows will be incomplete relative to the RFP requirement.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 (p.18): "including time for review and resubmission."

### P-003: Quality by Checkpoint, Not Inspection at End

QA/QC checkpoints embedded in the submission process (rather than deferred to construction verification) improve design quality and Owner confidence. Checkpoints at each milestone should include:
- Internal discipline peer review (before submission to Owner)
- Inter-discipline coordination review (clash check, interface confirmation)
- Owner review against programmatic requirements

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (pp.19–20): "Quality Management and Documentation — All work to be completed to current industry standards, good construction Best Practice, all applicable and referenced codes." Cross-reference: DEL-07-05 Quality Management Narrative.

### P-004: Document Standards Are Contractually Specified

All hard copy and digital documents must be "formatted, titled, and numbered to a standard to be established and agreed to by the Owner and the Project Manager" (RFP §7.2). The National Master Specification (NMS) format is recommended for specifications. All documents must be sealed by an Alberta-registered professional Architect/Engineer.

These obligations apply to every milestone submission, not just the final IFC package.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (p.20), verbatim.

### P-005: Milestone Dates Must Be Cross-Referenced to the Project Schedule

DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) "references design submission milestones from DEL-06-02" (Decomposition). This means the milestone dates stated in this plan must be consistent with the Gantt chart in DEL-09-01. Disconnects between milestone dates in the two deliverables will create evaluation and execution problems.

**Source:** Decomposition DEL-09-01 description.

### P-006: The Design Brief Is a Separate Commitment

RFP §7.1.8 states: "The Design-Builder is to submit a Design Brief with their proposal to describe the elements, products and specifics of building assemblies, components, etc. that show what is being provided." This is distinct from the detailed design milestones — it is a proposal-stage commitment that anchors all subsequent design submissions to a declared scope. The plan should acknowledge this Design Brief as the baseline for all milestone submissions.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 (p.18).

## Considerations

### C-001: Milestone Scope Calibration

The five milestones span a range from early conceptual confirmation (Building Design Development) to full construction-ready documentation (100% IFC). The content expectations differ substantially:

- Early milestones: massing confirmed, structural approach chosen, major systems identified, coordination issues surfaced
- Mid milestone (60%): drawings partially detailed, specifications drafted, major coordination issues resolved
- Late milestones (100% detail and 100% IFC): full drawing set, all details, all specs, sealed and coordinated

The plan should calibrate the expected content at each stage. Over-promising completeness at early stages sets up scope conflicts; under-delivering at late stages fails the Owner.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on industry standard phased design practice; RFP §7.1.8 does not define percentage completion for each stage.

### C-002: Foundation IFC as a Schedule Accelerator

The Foundation IFC milestone is listed as "if needed" in RFP §7.1.8. Its purpose is typically to allow foundation construction to begin while superstructure and building systems design continues, thereby compressing the overall project schedule. For a project where the Owner is described as "not schedule-driven" (Decomposition DEL-09-01 note), this milestone may be optional. The plan should address whether this milestone will be used and under what conditions.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 (p.18): "Foundation Issued for Construction (if needed)." ASSUMPTION: early foundation start is a schedule optimization strategy.

### C-003: Discipline Scope for This Project

For the Penhold PSB (combined Firehall and Public Works Operations Facility), expected design disciplines include:
- Architectural (building envelope, finishes, layout, accessibility)
- Structural (foundation, frame, lateral systems; 50-year design life for main building, 20-year for Cold Storage)
- Mechanical (HVAC including apparatus bay exhaust, bay sumps, 2" water fill stations, heating systems)
- Electrical/IT (power, lighting, controls, communications, solar-ready rough-ins per Addendum 03)
- Civil (site grading, utilities, drainage, site plan per 12-acre site)
- Specialty (fire suppression, security/access control, 40 bunker gear lockers with ventilated storage per Addendum 03)

**Source:** RFP §7.1.1–§7.1.2 (disciplines); Addendum 03 special requirements; _CONTEXT.md project description.

### C-004: Owner Document Access Obligation

RFP §7.3 requires the Design-Builder to "provide access to drawings, specifications and other design documents for the Owner, the Project Manager, and any other consultants retained directly by the Owner." The plan should describe how and when design documents are made available — whether via a shared document management system, email distribution, or Owner portal.

**Source:** RFP §7.3 (p.20).

### C-005: CCDC 14-2013 Contract Form Implications

Specification Standards table references CCDC 14-2013 (Design Build Contract) as the governing contract form, but this document has not been directly reviewed (location TBD). If CCDC 14-2013 imposes specific document submission requirements, review timelines, or document management obligations, these could affect milestone procedures and Owner review cycles described in this plan. The Design Manager should confirm whether CCDC 14-2013 prescribes any document handling requirements that should be reflected in the milestone plan, and update Specification and Procedure accordingly post-award. *(Added per semantic lensing item B-001: TBD question on CCDC 14-2013 evidence sufficiency.)*

**Source:** Specification Standards table (CCDC 14-2013 row); RFP §5.4. **TBD: CCDC 14-2013 contract text not reviewed.**

### C-006: BIM and Digital Coordination Methodology

The plan should explicitly state whether Building Information Modeling (BIM) or equivalent digital coordination tools will be used for inter-discipline clash detection and document coordination across milestones, or whether 2D drawing overlay methods will be the primary coordination approach. Procedure Step A5 mentions "BIM if applicable" but does not commit to or exclude BIM. For a multi-discipline project of this scale (combined Firehall and Public Works Operations Facility on a 12-acre site), articulating the coordination technology approach demonstrates thorough knowledge of modern design coordination practice and strengthens the proposal's credibility with the evaluation panel. If BIM will not be used, a brief rationale (e.g., project scale does not warrant the overhead) should be stated. *(Added per semantic lensing item B-002: BIM/digital coordination methodology gap.)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: BIM applicability assessment based on project scope and multi-discipline coordination requirement (RFP §7.3.4); Procedure Step A5 reference.

### C-007: Evaluator Perspective — What Distinguishes a High-Scoring Plan

RFP Section 8.3 allocates 3 points to Design Methodology within the 10-point Project Delivery Plan score. While the plan must meet all RFP §7.1.8 requirements for compliance, evaluation panels typically distinguish high-scoring responses by looking for:

- **Specificity over generality:** Named review durations, defined milestone content (discipline deliverables matrix), and stated coordination mechanisms score higher than generic statements like "the team will coordinate regularly"
- **Owner-centric framing:** Demonstrating that the Owner's review authority and decision timeline are respected and built into the process (not treated as a bottleneck)
- **Risk awareness:** Acknowledging that milestones are coordination checkpoints that reduce downstream rework, not just administrative obligations
- **Cross-deliverable coherence:** Showing that the documents plan is connected to the project schedule (DEL-09-01), quality management plan (DEL-07-05), and design methodology (DEL-06-01), rather than standing in isolation

The plan narrative should be written with this evaluator lens in mind, balancing compliance with competitive differentiation. *(Added per semantic lensing item C-002: evaluator-perspective rationale gap.)*

**Source:** RFP §8.3 Scoring Matrix (evaluation criteria); OBJ-002 scoring context from Decomposition. ASSUMPTION: evaluator expectations based on standard design-build proposal evaluation practice.

### C-008: Quality Dispute Resolution Between Disciplines

When discipline leads disagree on acceptable design quality at a milestone submission (e.g., the structural engineer considers the design coordination complete but the mechanical engineer identifies unresolved spatial conflicts), the plan should articulate the escalation and resolution hierarchy:

1. **Design Manager** has first authority to adjudicate inter-discipline coordination quality disputes
2. If the dispute involves a scope-affecting decision (e.g., a design change is needed to resolve a clash), the Design Manager escalates to the **Owner** for a design direction decision
3. The resolution and its rationale are documented in coordination meeting minutes

This escalation path ensures that quality disagreements do not stall milestone submissions and that the authority hierarchy is clear to all discipline leads. *(Added per semantic lensing item D-001: quality dispute escalation rationale gap.)*

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: escalation hierarchy inferred from Design Manager role (Specification, Procedure) and Owner approval authority (RFP §7.1.8, §7.3). No explicit dispute resolution protocol found in RFP.

### C-009: Alignment with Design Methodology Narrative

DEL-06-01 (Design Methodology Narrative, SOW-0008) describes the overall design process including design process sequencing, review and approval timelines, and permitting. DEL-06-02 (this deliverable) provides the specific milestone-level documentation plan. The two documents should be internally consistent — the process described in DEL-06-01 should be the context within which the milestones described here operate.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Milestone Rigor vs. Design Velocity

**Trade-off:** More detailed Owner review cycles at each of the five milestones improve design governance and reduce late-stage scope surprises, but they extend the design timeline if Owner review windows are long or approvals slow.

**Guidance:** Build realistic, stated review windows (e.g., 10 business days for Owner review, 5 business days for resubmission resolution) into the plan. Avoid vague language like "review as required." Stated windows demonstrate design management maturity and protect the schedule.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 (review and resubmission obligation). ASSUMPTION: specific duration not stated in RFP; owner-contractor agreement post-award.

### T-002: Foundation IFC Utilization

**Trade-off:** Using the Foundation IFC milestone adds a submission event and associated review/approval overhead, but can accelerate overall project schedule by enabling early earthworks and foundation construction. Skipping it simplifies the design process but may delay construction start.

**Guidance:** For a project where the Owner is "not schedule-driven," the schedule compression benefit of Foundation IFC is reduced. Recommend addressing Foundation IFC as conditional ("if the construction schedule requires an early foundation start, this milestone will be activated"). This keeps the option open without committing to the overhead.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 ("if needed" qualification). Decomposition DEL-09-01 schedule note.

### T-003: Discipline Deliverable Completeness at 60%

**Trade-off:** Requiring full preliminary drawings from all disciplines at the 60% review adds document production effort and schedule pressure, but ensures all coordination issues are surfaced before 100% design.

**Guidance:** Define "60% complete" explicitly for each discipline. A discipline deliverables matrix (recommended artifact) communicates this clearly to the evaluation panel. Avoid leaving "completeness" undefined, which risks misalignment between disciplines at the 60% review stage.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: industry standard definition of 60% design; RFP §7.1.8 does not define percentage completion per discipline.

*Note: This matrix is an ASSUMPTION based on industry standard phased design practice and the project discipline scope; specific content lists per milestone to be confirmed during design development.*

### EX-002: Owner Review Cycle Structure (Recommended Language for the Narrative)

"Following each milestone submission, the Owner and Project Manager will be provided [X] business days for review. The Design-Builder will respond to written review comments within [Y] business days. Where comments require design revisions, a resubmission will be issued within [Z] business days of the Owner's final comment set. Design proceeds to the next stage only after Owner written approval or conditional approval with agreed-upon conditions list."

*Note: Specific durations (X, Y, Z) are TBD — to be proposed by the Design-Builder and agreed with the Owner and Project Manager at project kick-off.*

### EX-003: QA/QC Checkpoint Description for 60% Review (Recommended Approach)

Before the 60% Detailed Design package is released to the Owner:
1. Each discipline lead confirms drawings and specifications are complete to the 60% standard and performs a self-check against the Design Brief.
2. A coordination review is held (in-person or virtual) where all disciplines review each other's drawings for spatial conflicts, especially mechanical/structural routing and electrical/structural penetrations.
3. The Design Manager reviews the submission against the RFP requirements and the Owner's Functional Program (Appendix B).
4. The Design Manager signs off on the QC checklist before the package is issued.
5. The package is submitted to the Owner with a transmittal letter listing all documents included.
