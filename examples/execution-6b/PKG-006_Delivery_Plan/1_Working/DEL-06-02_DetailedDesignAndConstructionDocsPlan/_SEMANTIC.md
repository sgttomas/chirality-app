# Deliverable: DEL-06-02 Detailed Design and Construction Documents Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to establish the structured plan governing how design documentation progresses through staged milestone submissions, discipline coordination, quality gates, and Owner review cycles from concept through construction-ready issuance. It must carry knowledge of submission sequencing, inter-discipline document governance, and the quality assurance framework that ensures each milestone package is complete, coordinated, and approved before design advances.

- p3 = adequate worth * confirmed quality = "verified merit"
- p4 = adequate worth * adequate assurance = "satisfied quality confidence"

**Step 3:** Centroid of {justified value authority, sufficient quality, verified merit, satisfied quality confidence} -> **"verified quality sufficiency"**

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=guiding: "settled value bearing" * "comprehensive governance scope" = "total value governance"
- k=applying: "enacted quality resolution" * "exhaustive delivery coverage" = "complete quality delivery"
- k=judging: "definitive quality verdict" * "exhaustive adjudication" = "total quality adjudication"
- k=reviewing: "resolved quality assurance" * "exhaustive review coverage" = "total quality review"

L = {total value governance, complete quality delivery, total quality adjudication, total quality review}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * completeness = "total value"

**Step 2:**
- p1 = total value * total value governance = "comprehensive worth governance"
- p2 = total value * complete quality delivery = "exhaustive quality fulfillment"
- p3 = total value * total quality adjudication = "complete merit ruling"
- p4 = total value * total quality review = "thorough quality examination"

**Step 3:** Centroid of {comprehensive worth governance, exhaustive quality fulfillment, complete merit ruling, thorough quality examination} -> **"exhaustive quality governance"**

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=guiding: "settled value bearing" * "disciplined guidance integrity" = "disciplined value bearing"
- k=applying: "enacted quality resolution" * "principled practice alignment" = "principled quality practice"
- k=judging: "definitive quality verdict" * "principled adjudication integrity" = "principled quality ruling"
- k=reviewing: "resolved quality assurance" * "principled audit consistency" = "consistent quality assurance"

L = {disciplined value bearing, principled quality practice, principled quality ruling, consistent quality assurance}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * consistency = "stable value"

**Step 2:**
- p1 = stable value * disciplined value bearing = "consistent worth orientation"
- p2 = stable value * principled quality practice = "principled quality standard"
- p3 = stable value * principled quality ruling = "consistent merit judgment"
- p4 = stable value * consistent quality assurance = "reliable quality confidence"

**Step 3:** Centroid of {consistent worth orientation, principled quality standard, consistent merit judgment, reliable quality confidence} -> **"principled quality integrity"**
