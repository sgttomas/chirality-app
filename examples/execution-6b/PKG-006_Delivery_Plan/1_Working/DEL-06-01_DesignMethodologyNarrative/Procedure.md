# Procedure — DEL-06-01: Design Methodology Narrative

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes the workflow for **producing** the Design Methodology Narrative as a proposal response component. The narrative, once finalized, is incorporated into the proposal PDF under the Section 7.1 position. This procedure covers the proposal production process only — not the post-award execution of the design methodology, which is governed by CCDC 14-2013, Appendix J Supplementary Conditions, and the Design-Builder's internal project management processes.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Read and Analyze RFP Section 7.1 Requirements

**Action:**

1. Read RFP Section 7.1 in full. Note all sub-sections, specific language (e.g., "shall describe," "address"), and any numbered or bulleted requirements.

2. Produce a **Requirements Mapping Table** that maps each RFP 7.1 element to a proposed narrative section:

| RFP 7.1 Element | Proposed Narrative Section | Owner/Author | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Design approach (overall) | Design Approach & Philosophy | Design Manager | TBD |
| Collaboration with Owner/stakeholders/Project Committee | Stakeholder Engagement & Owner Coordination | Design Manager | TBD |
| Design process sequencing with review/approval timelines | Design Phase Sequencing & Milestone Gates | Lead Architect | TBD |

| Multi-discipline coordination | Multi-Discipline Coordination Mechanism | Lead Architect | TBD |

3. Flag any ambiguities or sub-requirements in RFP Section 7.1 where additional interpretation is needed. Note that DEL-06-02 covers the detailed design submission milestone deliverables (RFP 7.1.8); this narrative covers the process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Requirements Mapping Table completed; all RFP 7.1 elements assigned to narrative sections.
- Ambiguities documented for Design Manager resolution.

**Responsible Party:** Design Manager / Proposal Manager

### Step 2 — Map Addenda Implications to Design Process

**Action:**

1. Review Addendum 01, 02, and 03 and identify implications for the **design process** (not just design content):

**Addendum 01 (Jul 11, 2024):**
- §1.2: Missing functional program dimensions intentional; designer to propose innovative solutions; spaces must at minimum meet building code.
- **Design process implication:** Design methodology must describe how innovative ideas are evaluated and validated against cost, code, and schedule — and how innovation is bounded by non-negotiable Addendum 03 requirements.

**Addendum 02 (Jul 15, 2024):**
- Formatting error; no missing information.
- **Design process implication:** None.

**Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024):**
- §1.1: 12-acre functional site (20 acres total; 8 acres storm pond + dog park).
- §1.2: Pickled Sand Storage excluded.
- §1.3: Bay sumps required.
- §1.4: Overhead doors 16 ft minimum height.
- §1.5: Fire apparatus direct exhaust (2 apparatus per bay).
- §1.6: PW bay general ventilation (occasional idling, occasional welding).
- §1.7: Site servicing cash allowance acceptable.
- §1.8: Backup generator: kitchen, ICP, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening.
- §1.9: 2" water fill stations (1 fire, 1 PW).
- §1.10: Solar-capable roofing; flat/south/west/southwest orientation.
- §1.11: 40 bunker gear lockers; room-level ventilation.
- §1.12 to §1.16: (Additional clarifications -- content TBD; confirm from Addendum 03 source text. **These sections may contain driver requirements not yet captured in the Driver Requirements Checklist or in the four DEL-06-01 documents. Until enumerated, design methodology coverage for sections 1.12-1.16 cannot be confirmed as complete.** Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md B-001; Proposed Authority: Addendum 03 source document)
- §1.17: Second storey acceptable for shared spaces.
- §1.18: FF&E additional item only, not in base cost.
- **Design process implication:** Each §1.3–§1.16 requirement is a design driver that must be locked at concept and verified at each milestone. Design methodology must describe how these requirements are tracked through the design process.

2. Produce a **Driver Requirements Checklist** that will be incorporated as a design-phase QA/QC tool:

| Requirement | Addendum Source | Discipline(s) Responsible | Phase When Locked | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12-acre functional site boundary | Add 03 §1.1 | Civil, Architecture | Concept / Building DD | Site plan compliance check |
| Pickled Sand Storage excluded | Add 03 §1.2 | Architecture, Civil | Concept | Negative confirmation in concept program |
| Bay sumps (all bays) | Add 03 §1.3 | MEP, Structural | Building DD | Floor plan + structural drawings include sumps |
| Overhead doors 16 ft min height | Add 03 §1.4 | Architecture | Building DD | Elevation drawings confirm door height |
| Fire apparatus direct exhaust (2/bay) | Add 03 §1.5 | MEP, Architecture | Building DD | Mechanical sch. shows 2 exhaust per fire bay |
| PW bay general ventilation | Add 03 §1.6 | MEP | Building DD | Mechanical schedule confirms PW bay ventilation |
| Backup generator (kitchen, ICP, 2 baths, bay doors) | Add 03 §1.8 | MEP, Electrical | 60% DD | Mechanical/electrical loads schedule confirms scope |
| 2" fill stations (1 fire, 1 PW) | Add 03 §1.9 | MEP | 60% DD | Plumbing schedule confirms station size and count |
| Solar-capable roof (flat/S/W/SW) | Add 03 §1.10 | Architecture, Structural, Electrical | Building DD | Roof plan + orientation drawing |
| 40 bunker gear lockers + room ventilation | Add 03 §1.11 | Architecture, MEP | Building DD | Floor plan locker count; mechanical schedule |
| Second storey option (shared spaces) | Add 03 §1.17 | Architecture, Structural | Building DD | Floor plan + structural concept confirm option |

3. Draft a **Narrative Section on Addenda Integration** (2–4 paragraphs) that explicitly describes how the team has incorporated Addenda into the design process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All three Addenda reviewed; design process implications documented.
- Driver Requirements Checklist completed.
- Addenda integration narrative section drafted.

**Responsible Party:** Design Manager with input from Lead Architect

### Step 3 — Define Design Phase Structure and Milestone Gates

**Action:**

1. Confirm the five design submission milestones from RFP Section 7.1.8 (per DEL-06-02):
   - Building Design Development
   - 60% Detailed Design
   - Foundation IFC
   - 100% Building Detail Design
   - 100% IFC Detailed Design Package

2. For each milestone phase, define for inclusion in the narrative:

| Phase | Key Process Activities | Owner Decision Gate | Permitting Integration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Building Design Development | Concept locked; program compliance confirmed; 5-discipline coordination aligned; Driver Requirements Checklist verified; preliminary cost estimate | Owner approval to proceed to 60% DD | Pre-application AHJ meeting: confirm permit requirements and flag high-risk design elements |
| 60% Detailed Design | Building systems defined; MEP/Electrical strategies; site utilities preliminary; constructability review; cost updated; value engineering if needed | Owner approval to proceed to Foundation IFC | Foundation permit documentation begins; civil/structural package nearing permit readiness |
| Foundation IFC | Foundation + site utilities package complete; ready for permit submission; civil and structural sign-off | Owner confirmation of Foundation package | Foundation permit submission to AHJ; begins early site work mobilization |
| 100% Building Detail Design | All building systems detailed; code compliance verified; specifications 90% complete; revised cost estimate; schedule impact confirmed | Owner approval to proceed to 100% IFC | Building permit documentation nearing complete; pre-submission AHJ coordination if needed |
| 100% IFC Detailed Design Package | Final construction documents; specifications complete; all trades; cost locked; schedule locked; QA/QC final review | Owner approval to issue for construction | Building permit submission to AHJ |

3. Estimate durations for each phase (coordinate with DEL-09-01 scheduler). ASSUMPTION: Durations are illustrative; actual durations depend on project complexity and Owner review windows.

4. Identify the **critical path** for design phases: which phases are sequentially dependent (Foundation IFC must precede construction mobilization; 100% IFC must precede trade procurement)?

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All five RFP 7.1.8 milestones are defined with process activities, Owner gate, and permitting integration.
- Phase durations are proposed and coordinated with DEL-09-01.
- Critical path is identified.

**Responsible Party:** Design Manager with Lead Architect and DEL-09-01 Scheduler

### Step 4 — Define Stakeholder Engagement and Owner Coordination

**Action:**

1. Define the **Coordination Meeting Structure**:
   - **Design Team Meetings:** Weekly; Design Manager + Lead Architect + discipline leads; focus on design coordination, clash resolution, milestone progress.
   - **Owner Project Committee Meetings:** Bi-weekly; Design Manager + Lead Architect + relevant discipline leads + Owner Committee (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk); focus on design progress, Owner decisions, cost/schedule updates.
   - **End-User Sessions:** At Concept and Building DD phases; Fire Chief + Public Works Manager; focus on operational review (apparatus circulation, gear storage, workshop workflow, maintenance access).

2. Define the **Feedback and Decision Documentation Process**:
   - Design Manager distributes **Weekly Design Update** (marked drawings, outstanding decisions list, open questions) after each design team meeting.
   - All Owner decisions recorded in **Design Decision Log** (cumulative; distributed after each Owner meeting).
   - Phase gate transitions require formal **Owner Sign-Off** (written approval to proceed to next phase).

3. Define **Approval Authority** hierarchy:
   - Owner Committee sign-off required: design phase gate transitions, major scope changes, cost impact decisions.
   - Design Manager authority: day-to-day design decisions within Owner-approved direction.
   - Discipline Lead authority: technical decisions within their discipline that do not affect cost, schedule, or other disciplines.

4. Draft the **Stakeholder Engagement Section** of the narrative (1–2 paragraphs).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Meeting structure (type, frequency, participants, agenda) defined for all meeting types.
- Feedback and decision documentation process specified.
- Approval authority hierarchy documented.
- Narrative section drafted.

**Responsible Party:** Design Manager

---

### Step 5 — Define Multi-Discipline Coordination Approach

**Action:**

1. Identify the **Coordination Mechanism** to be used: shared BIM model, traditional drawing coordination, hybrid approach. State the mechanism explicitly — do not claim capabilities the team does not have.

2. Define the **Design Lead** and authority structure:
   - Lead Architect: overall design authority; manages discipline interfaces; resolves cross-discipline conflicts.
   - Each Discipline Lead: authority within their discipline; responsible for coordination at interfaces.

3. Map **Critical Coordination Interfaces** that require active management:

| Interface | Disciplines | Critical Design Decision | Phase When Resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Site layout | Architecture + Civil | Building footprint placement, access routes, Cold Storage location | Building DD |
| Apparatus bay layout | Architecture + MEP + Structural | Bay dimensions, sump locations, exhaust routing, door clear heights | Building DD |
| Mechanical room and equipment | Architecture + MEP + Structural | Room size, equipment clearances, service access paths | 60% DD |
| Roof structure and solar provisions | Architecture + Structural + Electrical | Roof framing for solar load; solar panel area and orientation | 60% DD |
| Generator location and exhaust | MEP + Electrical + Civil + Architecture | Outdoor generator pad, fuel storage, exhaust routing, electrical transfer switch location | 60% DD |
| IT/security rough-in | Architecture + Electrical | Conduit routes, equipment rooms, server/telecom room location | 60% DD |

4. Define **Conflict Resolution Process**:
   - Step 1: Discipline Leads attempt resolution at weekly design meeting.
   - Step 2: If unresolved, Lead Architect makes binding decision (within 2 business days).
   - Step 3: If decision has cost/schedule implications, Design Manager communicates impact to Owner and Decision Log is updated.

5. Draft the **Multi-Discipline Coordination Section** of the narrative.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Coordination mechanism specified.
- Design Lead and authority structure defined.
- Critical coordination interfaces mapped.
- Conflict resolution process described.
- Narrative section drafted.

**Responsible Party:** Lead Architect with input from discipline leads

### Step 6 — Define Design-Phase QA/QC Approach

**Action:**

1. Define **QA/QC Checks at each design phase milestone**:

| Phase | QA/QC Checks | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| Building Design Development | Program compliance (all spaces per OSR + Functional Program + Addendum 03 room ranges); Driver Requirements Checklist verified; site fit (12-acre boundary); preliminary code analysis | Design Manager + Lead Architect |
| 60% Detailed Design | Building systems coordination (clash detection); code compliance (NBCC + Alberta ABC); cost estimate within budget; constructability assessment; all Addendum 03 driver requirements confirmed in design | Lead Architect + Cost Consultant + Discipline Leads |
| Foundation IFC | Foundation design consistent with 2021 geotechnical report (Appendix D); civil/structural coordination complete; site utilities coordination. **Geotechnical Report Sufficiency Decision Point:** Structural Lead shall evaluate whether the existing 2021 geotechnical report provides sufficient data for final foundation design, applying the following criteria: (a) soil bearing capacity data covers the proposed building footprint area; (b) groundwater conditions are characterized to foundation depth; (c) frost penetration and heave potential are addressed for the proposed foundation type; (d) report recommendations are compatible with the proposed structural system. If any criterion is not met, Structural Lead documents the gap, estimates cost/schedule impact of supplemental investigation, and presents to Design Manager for Owner communication. Decision recorded in Design Decision Log. (Source: Guidance C-004; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md X-002; Proposed Authority: Structural Lead + Geotechnical Consultant) | Structural Lead + Civil Lead + Design Manager |
| 100% Building Detail Design | Full code compliance verified (NBCC + Alberta ABC); specifications 90%+ complete; all systems detailed and coordinated; cost finalized; QA/QC review against Driver Requirements Checklist | Design Manager + all Discipline Leads + Cost Consultant |
| 100% IFC | Final specification review; all drawing sets reviewed for completeness; constructability final check; Owner QA/QC confirmation | Design Manager + Proposal Manager (for proposal stage) |

2. Define QA/QC **Responsibility Assignment**:
   - Design Manager: overall QA/QC coordination; produces QA/QC Report at each milestone.
   - Lead Architect: architectural compliance; design authority on cross-discipline QA/QC conflicts.
   - Each Discipline Lead: discipline-level QA/QC within their scope.
   - Cost Consultant: cost validation and budget tracking.
   - ASSUMPTION: A third-party constructability reviewer may be engaged at 60% DD for complex systems (apparatus bay exhaust, generator, sump drainage) — optional depending on firm capabilities.

3. Draft the **Design QA/QC Section** of the narrative.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- QA/QC checks defined for all five design phases.
- Responsibility assigned for each check.
- Narrative section drafted.

**Responsible Party:** Design Manager with QA/QC lead (if separate role)

---

### Step 7 — Define Permitting and AHJ Engagement Strategy

**Action:**

1. Identify **Permit Types** for this project (ASSUMPTION: standard Alberta municipal permit process):
   - **Pre-Application Meeting:** AHJ technical meeting at Building Design Development phase; clarify permit requirements and high-risk design elements.
   - **Foundation Permit:** Submitted at Foundation IFC milestone; covers foundation, site utilities, site grading; enables early site mobilization.
   - **Building Permit:** Submitted at 100% Building Detail Design or 100% IFC; covers full building; enables full construction.
   - **Occupancy Permit:** Issued post-construction when AHJ confirms building is code-compliant and safe to occupy.

2. Identify **High-Risk Design Elements** that may require early AHJ discussion:
   - Fire apparatus direct exhaust system (NFPA 1 compliance; AHJ approval for exhaust routing)
   - Emergency generator fuel storage and exhaust (fire code, building code, zoning)
   - Solar-capable roof structural provisions (load calculations, AHJ approval for roof loading)
   - Bunker gear room ventilation (NFPA 1 requirements for fire station design)
   - Second-storey shared spaces (if proposed; access, egress, fire separation)

3. Propose **Early AHJ Engagement Strategy:**
   - Schedule Pre-Application Meeting at Building Design Development phase (before detailed design investment is locked).
   - Present preliminary site plan, building massing, and key design decisions (exhaust routing, generator placement, solar orientation) for informal AHJ feedback.
   - Document AHJ feedback and incorporate into design before 60% DD.

4. Build **Permitting Timeline** into design phase schedule (coordinate with DEL-09-01):
   - ASSUMPTION: AHJ review time for Foundation Permit: 4–6 weeks.
   - ASSUMPTION: AHJ review time for Building Permit: 6–8 weeks.
   - If AHJ requests design revisions, Design Manager assesses cost/schedule impact and communicates to Owner.

5. Draft the **Permitting Strategy Section** of the narrative.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Permit types identified.
- AHJ engagement points defined.
- High-risk design elements listed with early engagement plan.
- Permitting timeline integrated into design schedule.
- Narrative section drafted.

**Responsible Party:** Design Manager with Lead Architect and AHJ liaison (if applicable)

---

### Step 8 — Define Innovation and Value Approach

**Action:**

1. Define the **Innovation Evaluation Framework** for Open Design Opportunities (per Addendum 01):
   - Identify where the design team will exercise creative judgment (spatial layouts, space efficiency, system integration, operational flow optimization).
   - Distinguish from Fixed Requirements (Addendum 03 driver requirements) that are non-negotiable.
   - Evaluation criteria for innovations: (a) code-compliant or exceeds code; (b) within cost envelope; (c) does not extend schedule; (d) improves operational functionality for Owner end-users.

2. List **Potential Innovation Areas** (ASSUMPTION — to be confirmed with design team):
   - Apparatus bay spatial configuration (optimize for fire truck maneuvering and operational adjacencies)
   - Second-storey shared space design (if proposed — maximizes usable area within 12-acre site)
   - Solar roof optimization (maximize solar-ready surface area while meeting functional program)
   - HVAC system integration (shared or combined systems for energy efficiency across building zones)
   - Structural system innovation (steel vs. precast vs. mass timber for apparatus bays — cost and schedule optimization)

3. Define **Value Engineering Process** (if design trends over budget):
   - Design Manager triggers value engineering review when cost estimate exceeds budget target by [TBD %].
   - Cost Consultant and design team produce a **Value Engineering Report** with prioritized options (retain, modify, or eliminate design features) without compromising Fixed Requirements or Owner baseline program.
   - Value engineering options presented to Owner Committee for decision.

4. Draft the **Innovation & Value Section** of the narrative.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Innovation evaluation criteria defined.
- Potential innovation areas identified (not over-promised).
- Value engineering process described.
- Distinction between open opportunities and fixed requirements clearly articulated.
- Narrative section drafted.

**Responsible Party:** Lead Architect + Design Manager

## Records

**Artifacts produced by this procedure:**

| Artifact | Description | Retained By |
|---|---|---|
| **Design Methodology Narrative** | Final narrative section for inclusion in proposal PDF; approximately 2–4 pages | Proposal Manager; included in final proposal PDF |
| **RFP 7.1 Requirements Mapping Table** | Working document confirming all RFP 7.1 elements addressed | Design Manager; internal QA record |
| **Driver Requirements Checklist** | Addendum 03 driver requirements mapped to discipline, design phase, and verification method | Design Manager; carried through post-award design as a live QA tool |
| **Design Decision Log Template** | Template for tracking Owner-approved design decisions post-award | Design Manager; used in post-award design phase execution |
| **Design Phase Schedule Framework** | Phase durations and milestone dates (coordinated with DEL-09-01) | Scheduler/Design Manager; incorporated into DEL-09-01 |
| **Design QA/QC Checklist Template** | Template for design review at each milestone phase | Design Manager; used post-award |
| **Addenda Integration Notes** | Working document mapping each Addendum item to design process response | Design Manager; internal evidence of addenda compliance |

---

**Notes:**
- This procedure focuses on **producing** the Design Methodology Narrative for the proposal response. The **execution** of the design methodology post-award is governed by CCDC 14-2013, Appendix J Supplementary Conditions, and the Design-Builder's internal project management processes.
- Steps 3, 5, and 7 have the most interdependency with other deliverables (DEL-06-02 for milestones, DEL-09-01 for schedule, DEL-07-01 for construction methodology consistency). Coordinate early.
- The Driver Requirements Checklist produced in Step 2 is not only a proposal production tool — it becomes a live project management tool post-award. Ensure it is comprehensive and actionable.
- ASSUMPTION: The narrative will be reviewed by a generalist Evaluation Committee member, not a design specialist. Write for clarity and persuasiveness, not technical depth. Technical depth is covered in the design brief (DEL-03-xx) and concept design (DEL-02-xx) deliverables.
