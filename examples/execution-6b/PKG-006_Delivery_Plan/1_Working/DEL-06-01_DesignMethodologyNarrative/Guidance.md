# Guidance — DEL-06-01: Design Methodology Narrative

---

## Purpose

The Design Methodology Narrative is the Proponent's opportunity to demonstrate to the Town of Penhold's Evaluation Committee that they understand **how** design is produced in a Design-Build context — not just what will be built, but how the design process will be organized, governed, and aligned with Owner expectations.

This narrative earns 3 of 10 Project Delivery Plan points. To maximize score, the narrative must persuade evaluators across four dimensions:

1. **Coherent process**: The Design-Builder has a disciplined, structured approach to producing design deliverables across all disciplines.
2. **Owner-alignment**: The design process actively involves and serves the Town's Project Committee (Pendergast [PM], Kowalchuk [Ops Mgr], Binnendyk [CAO]) with clear collaboration structures.
3. **Addenda responsiveness**: Addendum 01's innovation invitation and Addendum 03's 16+ program requirements are genuinely understood and embedded in the design process — not treated as afterthoughts.
4. **Downstream coherence**: The design methodology supports and is consistent with the conceptual design (DEL-02-xx), design brief (DEL-03-xx), construction methodology (DEL-07-xx), and schedule (DEL-09-01).

This guidance is authored to support the Design Manager and Proposal Manager in producing a high-scoring, credible narrative. It is not the narrative itself.

**Owner Approval Authority (Authoritative Description):**
The Owner approval and decision-making structure operates on three tiers. This is the single authoritative description; all four DEL-06-01 documents should reference this structure consistently:
1. **Owner Committee** (Pendergast [PM], Kowalchuk [Ops Mgr], Binnendyk [CAO]): formal sign-off required for design phase gate transitions, major scope changes, and cost impact decisions.
2. **Design Manager**: authority for day-to-day design decisions within the direction approved by the Owner Committee.
3. **Discipline Lead**: authority for technical decisions within their discipline that do not affect cost, schedule, or other disciplines.

Formal Owner Committee approval is required at each major phase gate (Building DD, 60% DD, Foundation IFC, 100% DD, 100% IFC). Feedback is integrated between review cycles; all decisions are documented in the Design Decision Log.

## Principles

**P-001 — Addenda as Design Drivers, Not Scope Additions**

Addendum 01 (Jul 11, 2024) stated that missing functional program dimensions are intentional and designers are encouraged to propose innovative solutions meeting or exceeding building code. Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024) provided 16+ specific program clarifications that fundamentally shape the building.

The narrative must treat these not as late-breaking requirements to work around, but as **foundational design inputs** that shape the entire methodology. Evaluators will be looking for evidence that the Proponent read and internalized the Addenda, not just acknowledged them.
- Source: Addendum 01 §1.2; Addendum 03 §§1.1–1.18; Decomposition §4

**P-002 — Specific Engagement Structures, Not Generic Collaboration Language**

Owner engagement in Design-Build projects frequently fails due to vague commitment language ("we will keep the Owner informed"). The narrative must specify: meeting cadence, participant roles, agenda structure, feedback timelines, decision documentation method, and approval authority at phase gates.

The Project Committee (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk) should be named as the primary Owner-side engagement point. End-user groups (Fire Department, Public Works) may also be engagement targets for operational input.

**P-003 — Design Phase Milestones Must Match RFP 7.1.8**

RFP Section 7.1.8 names five specific design submission milestones: Building Design Development, 60% Detailed Design, Foundation IFC, 100% Building Detail Design, and 100% IFC Detailed Design Package. The design methodology narrative should describe the process by which the team progresses through these phases — not invent a different milestone structure.

DEL-06-02 covers the detailed deliverable list at each milestone. DEL-06-01 covers the process, governance, and engagement model. The two documents must be internally consistent.
- Source: RFP 7.1.8; Decomposition SOW-0018 (covers DEL-06-02); Decomposition SOW-0008 (covers DEL-06-01)

**P-004 — Innovation Within a Non-Negotiable Constraint Set**

Addendum 01 grants design flexibility on missing program dimensions; Addendum 03 establishes a set of non-negotiable program requirements. The design methodology must articulate this duality:
- Where can the Design-Builder exercise creative judgment (spatial layouts, energy systems, material selections, operational flow optimization)?
- Where are the non-negotiable requirements that must be met exactly (16 ft overhead doors, apparatus bay direct exhaust, bay sumps, 2" fill stations, 40 bunker gear lockers, solar-capable roof orientation, generator loads)?

The narrative is stronger if it explicitly names this distinction rather than vaguely promising to "meet all requirements while being innovative."
- Source: Addendum 01 §1.2; Addendum 03 §§1.4–1.16

**P-005 — Permitting as a Design Schedule Risk, Not a Footnote**

AHJ engagement and permit timing are material to design schedule and cost. The narrative should propose a proactive permitting strategy: a pre-application meeting at early design phase to clarify AHJ expectations, Foundation permit submission aligned with the Foundation IFC milestone, and Building permit submission at or near 100% DD. High-risk elements (generator fuel storage, fire apparatus exhaust routing, solar roof provisions) warrant early AHJ technical discussion.

ASSUMPTION: Typical Alberta municipal AHJ review times vary by permit type. Procedure Step 7 distinguishes Foundation Permit (4-6 weeks) from Building Permit (6-8 weeks); these are different permit types with different review complexity. This principle's reference to "4-6 weeks" should be understood as applying to the Foundation Permit specifically. For the Building Permit, the longer 6-8 week estimate applies. Both assumptions should be made explicit in the narrative and confirmed with AHJ during the pre-application meeting. See Conflict Table CT-001 for normalization status. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-003; Proposed Authority: Design Manager + AHJ consultation)
- Source: RFP 7.1 (permitting process as a listed design methodology element)

**P-006 — Multi-Discipline Coordination Must Name the Mechanism**

A five-discipline Design-Build project (Architecture + Civil + Structural + Mechanical + Electrical/IT) requires explicit coordination infrastructure. The narrative should state: who leads (Lead Architect as design authority), how coordination happens (weekly design meetings, shared drawing coordination or BIM platform), how conflicts are detected and resolved, and who manages discipline interface (Architecture defines envelope and grid; Structural designs within the grid; MEP routes within structural framing; Electrical integrates power and data).

ASSUMPTION: The level of BIM usage depends on the Proponent's capabilities; the narrative should describe the actual coordination mechanism the team will use — not aspirationally claim BIM if the team uses traditional drawing coordination.

## Standards Rationale Notes

**NFPA 1 (Fire Code) -- Rationale for Inclusion in Specification Standards Table:**
NFPA 1 is listed in the Specification Standards table as an assumed applicable standard for fire station design in Canada. However, no RFP citation or contract reference supports its inclusion. The rationale for listing it is that fire stations in Canadian jurisdictions commonly fall under NFPA 1 provisions for apparatus bay exhaust, bunker gear ventilation, and generator fuel storage -- all of which are Addendum 03 driver requirements. However, if the AHJ does not require NFPA 1 compliance, referencing it in the narrative could create unnecessary contractual obligations for the Design-Builder. **Recommendation:** Confirm with AHJ during the pre-application meeting (Procedure Step 7) whether NFPA 1 is an applicable standard for this facility. If confirmed, update Specification Standards with the applicable edition and clause numbers. If not required, remove or downgrade to "reference standard (non-mandatory)" to avoid creating unintended obligations. See Conflict Table CT-002 for tracking.

## Considerations

| Consideration | Why It Matters | Design Response Options |
|---|---|---|
| **C-001 — Owner Operational Knowledge** | The Fire Department (apparatus operations, gear storage, SCBA workflow), Public Works (maintenance, vehicle circulation, workshop use), and CAO (budget, public accountability) all have deep operational knowledge that must inform design decisions. | Narrative should commit to structured end-user engagement sessions at early design phases (concept and 30% DD); separate from Project Committee formal approvals. Consider site visits to comparable facilities if available. |
| **C-002 — Site Constraints (12-acre developable of 20 acres total)** | 8 acres are storm pond + dog park (flood fringe). Site grading, utilities, parking, emergency vehicle access, and landscape are constrained. Cold Storage building placement must not conflict with fire apparatus maneuvering. | Narrative should reference use of site reference reports (Geotechnical 2021, Wetland Assessment, Grading Plans, Environmental Assessment) in design concept development. Early civil/geotechnical review informs foundation approach. |
| **C-003 — Addendum 03 Late Integration Risk** | Addendum 03 was issued 30 days before submission deadline — after substantial RFP preparation time. Evaluators will actively look for whether Proponents actually integrated these requirements. | Narrative should explicitly cite Addendum 03 items (sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar, lockers) and describe how they are embedded in the design process from concept. Avoid generic language. |
| **C-004 — Missing Geotechnical Investigation** | Foundation design relies on the existing 2021 geotechnical report (Appendix D) only. No additional investigation is planned or priced (DEC-013). The design methodology must incorporate this constraint — the design team reviews existing report in early design phases. | Narrative should state that Structural lead reviews 2021 geotechnical report findings at project kickoff; design methodology includes a decision point on whether existing report is sufficient for final foundation design or whether a supplemental scoped investigation is needed (cost/schedule risk if additional investigation is required). |
| **C-005 — Schedule Flexibility as an Opportunity** | The Owner is "not schedule-driven" (Decomposition §1). This means the Proponent can propose a design phase sequence that optimizes quality and cost — e.g., spending more time at early design phases to reduce rework at detailed design. | Narrative should leverage this flexibility: propose a design phase schedule that prioritizes Owner engagement and coordination quality, not the shortest possible timeline. The risk of rushing design (rework, cost overruns, AHJ feedback) outweighs the benefit of a shorter schedule for this Owner. |
| **C-006 — Cost Validation Throughout Design** | Design decisions drive cost. In Design-Build, the Proponent bears the risk if design choices result in cost overruns relative to the contract price. Early and frequent cost validation (at each design phase) reduces this risk. | Narrative should describe cost consultant integration: cost estimates updated at each design phase milestone; value engineering process triggered if design trends over budget; Owner informed of cost implications of design decisions. |
| **C-007 — Knowledge Transfer to Construction** | In a Design-Build, the design team's intent must be communicated clearly to the construction team. Poorly documented design decisions (especially for complex systems like apparatus exhaust, generator connection, sump drainage) lead to construction errors or field changes. | Narrative should address design handoff: what documentation is produced at IFC stage? How are complex systems narrated for the construction team? Are construction drawings accompanied by system design narratives? This consideration is now anchored in Specification R-013. |
| **C-008 — Accessibility/Adaptability Scope Boundary with DEL-03-06** | R-010 requires the Design Methodology Narrative to "demonstrate awareness" of accessibility and adaptability requirements but limits treatment to "high-level integration." This is a deliberate scoping decision, not an omission. The rationale: (a) DEL-03-06 (Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative) provides the substantive, detailed treatment of accessibility per RFP 7.1.3 and adaptability per RFP 7.1.5; (b) the Design Methodology Narrative's role is to show that accessibility and adaptability are embedded as design considerations throughout the phased design process, not to duplicate the detailed technical narrative; (c) evaluators reading the full proposal will see both sections -- the methodology shows process integration while DEL-03-06 shows technical depth. The narrative should include a brief statement that accessibility and adaptability are design considerations at each phase, with a forward reference to DEL-03-06 for the detailed treatment. Without this rationale, evaluators may perceive the limited coverage as incomplete rather than intentional scoping. (Source: Specification R-010; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md E-002; Proposed Authority: Design Manager) | Include a 1-2 sentence acknowledgment of accessibility/adaptability as design considerations integrated from concept, with explicit reference to DEL-03-06 for detailed treatment. Frame as deliberate complementary coverage, not deferral. |

## Trade-offs

| Trade-off ID | Trade-off Scenario | Tension | Resolution Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T-001** | **Innovation vs. AHJ Approvability** | Addendum 01 encourages innovative space layouts and design solutions. Novel designs may trigger additional AHJ scrutiny, longer review times, or rejection. | Narrative should distinguish between code-required features (non-negotiable; AHJ approved by default) and innovative elements (subject to AHJ discretion). Propose early AHJ engagement to clarify what innovative approaches are approvable before committing to them in detailed design. |
| **T-002** | **Design Duration vs. Design Quality** | More design phases and review cycles yield higher quality but extend the pre-construction timeline. Fewer cycles accelerate schedule but risk design errors, Owner dissatisfaction, and construction rework. | For a "not schedule-driven" Owner, prioritize quality: propose a realistic number of design phases (aligned with RFP 7.1.8 milestones) with adequate Owner review windows between phases. Avoid compressing review time at the expense of design quality. |
| **T-003** | **Detailed Permitting Plan vs. Design Flexibility** | Locking in a permitting strategy early reduces schedule risk but may over-constrain design decisions that permitting depends on (e.g., exhaust routing, generator placement, solar orientation). Keeping permitting flexible delays approvals and extends schedule. | Propose a phased permitting approach: Foundation permit proceeds from Foundation IFC while Building permit review is in parallel with 100% DD. Foundation permit requires fewer design decisions locked; Building permit locks the full design. Identify specific design decisions that are critical for each permit submission. |
| **T-004** | **Multi-Discipline Coordination Overhead vs. Efficiency** | Frequent coordination meetings (weekly or bi-weekly) ensure design integration but consume time and resources. Minimal coordination speeds individual discipline work but risks rework from coordination conflicts discovered late. | Propose a lightweight, consistent coordination cadence: weekly design team meetings for coordination; bi-weekly Project Committee meetings for Owner engagement. Use a shared coordination tracking tool (clash register, outstanding decisions list) to manage between meetings. |
| **T-005** | **Cost Validation Frequency vs. Design Creativity** | Frequent cost checks keep design aligned with budget but may constrain innovation if the team feels financially second-guessed at every turn. Deferring cost validation to later phases allows creative exploration but risks significant budget surprises. | Integrate cost consultant at project kickoff and at each major milestone; use "design and cost sandbox" model at early phases (concept and 30% DD) where cost estimates are directional, then tighten cost validation at 60%+ DD. Clearly communicate to the design team which phases are exploratory vs. budget-locked. |

## Examples

**EX-001 — Weak vs. Strong Addendum Integration Language**

*Weak (insufficient):*
> "We have reviewed all addenda and will incorporate their requirements into the design."

*Strong (evaluator-credible):*
> "Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024) identified 16 program clarifications that we treat as non-negotiable design drivers, not scope additions. In the Concept Design phase, the Architecture, MEP, and Structural leads jointly review the following requirements and lock them into the design platform before proceeding to 30% DD: apparatus bay sumps (MEP/Structural), direct exhaust ventilation for 2 apparatus per fire bay (MEP), 2" water fill stations in both fire and PW bays (MEP/Plumbing), backup generator sized for kitchen, ICP meeting room, 2 bathrooms, and bay door secondary opening (MEP/Electrical), solar-capable roof on flat/south/west/southwest orientation (Architecture/Structural/Electrical), and 40 bunker gear lockers with dedicated room ventilation (Architecture/MEP). Our design QA/QC checklist at each phase milestone includes a line-by-line verification that all Addendum 03 requirements remain incorporated as the design evolves."

**EX-002 — Weak vs. Strong Stakeholder Engagement Language**

*Weak (insufficient):*
> "We will hold regular meetings with the Owner to keep them informed."

*Strong (evaluator-credible):*
> "The Design Manager convenes bi-weekly **Design Coordination Meetings** with the Owner's Project Committee (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk), the Lead Architect, and relevant discipline leads. Standard agenda items: design progress against milestone schedule, decisions required from the Owner this period, cost/schedule implications of current design direction, and open items from the previous cycle. Between meetings, the Design Manager distributes a **Weekly Design Update** (marked drawings, outstanding decisions list, pending Owner feedback items). All Owner decisions are recorded in a **Design Decision Log** maintained by the Design Manager and distributed after each meeting. At each major milestone gate (Building DD, 60% DD, Foundation IFC, 100% DD, 100% IFC), the team prepares a formal **Design Submission Package** for Owner review and written approval before advancing to the next phase. Owner review periods of [TBD: suggest 5–10 business days per phase] are built into the design schedule."

**EX-003 — Articulating the Innovation/Constraint Balance**

*Context: Addendum 01 says missing program dimensions are intentional; Addendum 03 prescribes specific requirements.*

*Strong narrative:*
> "Addendum 01 clarified that intentionally missing functional program dimensions invite the Design-Builder to propose innovative, code-compliant solutions. We distinguish between two categories of design decisions: **Fixed Requirements** (from Addendum 03 and OSR — not subject to innovation without Owner approval, e.g., 16 ft overhead doors, 40 bunker gear lockers, apparatus bay direct exhaust) and **Open Design Opportunities** (from Addendum 01 flexibility, e.g., apparatus bay layout optimization, second-storey configuration for shared spaces, roof profile for solar orientation). Our design methodology applies systematic evaluation to Open Opportunities: each proposed innovation is assessed against three criteria — (1) does it comply with or exceed code requirements? (2) does it remain within the cost envelope? (3) does it reduce or maintain construction schedule duration? Innovations that pass all three criteria are presented to the Owner Committee for confirmation at the next review cycle. Innovations that fail one or more criteria are either modified or abandoned in favor of conventional solutions."

The following table illustrates how the design phase structure might be presented in the narrative (values are illustrative; actual durations should be finalized by the Design Manager):

| Phase (RFP 7.1.8 Name) | Illustrative Duration | Key Deliverables | Owner Approval Gate | Permitting Integration |

| Building Design Development | 6 weeks | Site plans, floor plans, massing, program verification checklist, preliminary cost estimate | Owner approval to proceed to 60% DD | Pre-application AHJ meeting; clarify permit requirements |
| 60% Detailed Design | 6 weeks | Building systems layouts, MEP/Electrical strategies, updated cost estimate, constructability review | Owner approval to proceed to Foundation IFC | Foundation permit documentation begins |
| Foundation IFC | 4 weeks | Foundation + site utilities packages ready for permit submission | Owner confirmation of Foundation package | Foundation permit submission to AHJ |
| 100% Building Detail Design | 6 weeks | All systems detailed; code compliance verified; revised cost estimate; schedule impact | Owner approval to proceed to 100% IFC | Building permit documentation finalizes |
| 100% IFC Detailed Design Package | 4 weeks | Final construction documents; specifications; all trades; cost locked; schedule locked | Owner approval to issue for construction | Building permit submission to AHJ |

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

The following items require human clarification or ruling to resolve ambiguity or inconsistency across documents.

| Conflict ID | Conflict (short statement) | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CT-001 | AHJ permit review time: Guidance P-005 states "4-6 weeks" for building permits generally; Procedure Step 7 distinguishes Foundation Permit (4-6 weeks) from Building Permit (6-8 weeks). The difference may be intentional (two different permit types) but P-005 does not make this distinction. | Guidance P-005 | Procedure Step 7 (Permitting Timeline) | Datasheet (AHJ Review Time rows); Guidance P-005; Procedure Step 7 | Design Manager + AHJ consultation | TBD |
| CT-002 | NFPA 1 listed in Specification Standards table as "ASSUMPTION: standard for fire stations in Canada; location TBD" but has no RFP or contract citation. If NFPA 1 is not required by the AHJ, referencing it in the narrative could create unnecessary contractual obligations. Rationale for inclusion should be confirmed or the standard should be removed. | Specification Standards (NFPA 1 row) | RFP / Contract (no NFPA 1 citation found) | Specification Standards; Procedure Step 7 (high-risk design elements reference NFPA 1) | AHJ confirmation | TBD |

---

**Notes:**
- ASSUMPTION: The scoring rubric for Design Methodology (3 points) likely rewards process clarity, Owner responsiveness, and Addenda integration over technical design depth. The narrative should be written for a generalist Evaluation Committee member, not a technical specialist.
- Avoid boilerplate ("we follow best practices for Design-Build delivery"). Every section should reference the specific project: 12-acre site, Fire Hall + Public Works facility, Addendum 03 program requirements, Project Committee members.
- The companion deliverable DEL-06-02 (Design Documents Plan) provides the detailed deliverable list at each milestone; DEL-06-01 (this deliverable) provides the process, governance, and engagement model. Ensure the two documents are written to complement each other, not repeat each other.
- Pass 3 Semantic Lensing enrichments applied: F-001 (NFPA 1 rationale), F-003 (AHJ review time normalization in P-005 and Conflict Table CT-001), E-001 (Owner approval authority normalization in Purpose section), E-002 (accessibility/adaptability scope boundary rationale in C-008), CT-002 (NFPA 1 obligation risk).
