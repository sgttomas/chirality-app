# Deliverable: DEL-06-01 Design Methodology Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** The Design Methodology Narrative exists to articulate how design delivery is organized, governed, and aligned with Owner expectations in a Design-Build context -- conveying process credibility, structured stakeholder engagement, addenda responsiveness, and multi-discipline coordination as a persuasive proposal narrative. It must demonstrate that the Proponent's design process is disciplined, Owner-centric, and capable of integrating non-negotiable program requirements with deliberate innovation opportunities across phased milestone gates.
