## Construction

| Component | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Design Approach & Philosophy** | Integrated Design-Build approach from concept through IFC; innovation within constraint (Addendum 01); driver requirements from Addendum 03 locked from concept phase | RFP 7.1; Addendum 01 §1.2; Addendum 03 |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Strategy** | Structured collaboration with Owner Project Committee (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk); defined meeting cadence; decision documentation (Decision Log); formal milestone approvals | RFP 7.1; Decomposition Vocabulary Map |
| **Design Phase Sequencing** | Staged design progression: Concept / 30% DD → 60% DD → Foundation IFC → 100% DD → 100% IFC; each phase has defined deliverables, decision points, and Owner approval gate | RFP 7.1; RFP 7.1.8 (milestones list in DEL-06-02) |
| **Owner Review & Approval Process** | Three-tier approval authority: (1) Owner Committee sign-off required for design phase gate transitions, major scope changes, and cost impact decisions; (2) Design Manager authority for day-to-day design decisions within Owner-approved direction; (3) Discipline Lead authority for technical decisions within their discipline that do not affect cost, schedule, or other disciplines. Formal Owner Committee approval required at each major phase gate; feedback integrated between cycles; revisions documented in Design Decision Log. Owner review window duration: TBD (suggest 5–10 business days per phase). | RFP 7.1; CCDC 14-2013 Design-Build obligations; Procedure Step 4 (approval hierarchy) |
| **Multi-Discipline Coordination** | Architecture, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT integrated through weekly design meetings; clash detection; shared coordination platform; Lead Architect as design authority | RFP 7.1.2; RFP 7.1.8 |
| **Permitting & AHJ Coordination** | Pre-application AHJ engagement at 30% DD; Foundation permit at Foundation IFC stage; Building permit at 100% DD; permitting timeline integrated into design schedule | RFP 7.1 (permitting mentioned); ASSUMPTION: standard Alberta permitting sequence |
| **Design QA/QC** | Code compliance verification at each phase; Functional Program + Addenda compliance checks; cost validation; constructability review; QA/QC Checklist at each milestone | RFP 7.2 (QA/QC scope); SOW-0029 |
| **Innovation & Value Approach** | Evaluation of flexible program opportunities per Addendum 01; value engineering if design trends over budget; innovation validated against code, cost, and schedule | Addendum 01 §1.2; RFP 7.1 |
| **Program Compliance Verification** | All Addendum 03 driver requirements treated as non-negotiable from concept; verification checklist embedded in each phase review | Addendum 03 §§1.1–1.18; Decomposition §4 |

**Notes:**
- This narrative is worth 3 of 10 Project Delivery Plan points. Evaluators assess clarity of approach, responsiveness to the Owner's stated needs, and demonstrated understanding of the Addenda implications. **TBD: Obtain the actual scoring rubric or evaluation criteria detail for the 3-point Design Methodology sub-criterion to confirm what evaluators assess beyond "process clarity, Owner responsiveness, and Addenda integration."** If the rubric uses different criteria, the narrative may need to address additional scoring dimensions. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md D-002; Proposed Authority: RFP evaluation criteria source)
- DEL-06-02 (Design Documents Plan) provides the companion milestones detail; together DEL-06-01 and DEL-06-02 form the complete PKG-006 Delivery Plan submission for design-related content.
- ASSUMPTION: Exact text of RFP Section 7.1 sub-requirements has not been accessed directly; content derived from decomposition references and addenda context. Location TBD for specific RFP clause text. **All four documents for DEL-06-01 are derived from this reconstructed understanding. If the actual RFP 7.1 text contains additional sub-requirements not captured in the decomposition, the documents may be incomplete.** (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-001; Proposed Authority: RFP Section 7.1 source text)
