## Standards

| Standard / Code | Applicability | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CCDC 14-2013** | Design-Build Contract Form — governs Design-Builder design obligations, Owner review rights, design submission requirements | RFP; Appendix J (Supplementary Conditions SC1–SC55) | **TBD: Add specific CCDC 14-2013 clause references for design submission obligations and Owner review rights. Without these clause numbers, the comprehensive record of applicable contract obligations is incomplete.** Document not directly accessed. Proposed Authority: CCDC 14-2013 contract document. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md B-002) |
| **NBCC (National Building Code of Canada)** | Building code compliance requirement for design | RFP OSR (Appendix A); RFP 7.1.3 (accessibility per NBCC/ABC) | **TBD (CRITICAL): Confirm the exact applicable NBCC edition and corresponding Alberta Building Code adoption. Mandatory practice under building code requires knowing the exact edition; "TBD" weakens the normative force of R-004, R-008, and R-010 which depend on code compliance. Proposed Authority: AHJ / Alberta Building Code registry.** (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-002) |
| **Alberta Building Code** | Provincial building code amendments, including accessibility requirements specific to Alberta | RFP 7.1.3 | Specific to Alberta; governs accessibility, occupancy classifications, fire safety provisions |
| **NFPA 1** | Fire Code — likely applicable to fire apparatus exhaust, generator fuel storage, and fire protection systems | ASSUMPTION: standard for fire stations in Canada; location TBD | ASSUMPTION (best-effort): likely applicable; AHJ may specify applicable edition. Not cited in RFP directly. |
| **OHS (Alberta Occupational Health and Safety Act)** | Design-phase consideration for safe constructability; worker safety provisions | ASSUMPTION: applicable to all Alberta construction projects; governs Design-Builder safety obligations | Design should consider constructability for safe construction; not directly cited in RFP for design methodology |
| **CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program)** | Insurance approach governing Design-Builder's risk management during design phase | RFP Appendix J; DEC-011 | Design methodology may reference how design decisions are managed to minimize professional liability exposure during design |

**Note on Standards:** Exact clause locations within CCDC 14-2013, NBCC, and Alberta Building Code are TBD (documents not directly accessed). Design methodology narrative should demonstrate familiarity with these standards without citing inaccessible specific clauses.

**Notes:**
- ASSUMPTION: RFP Section 7.1 exact text has not been directly accessed; requirements derived from SOW-0008 description, _CONTEXT.md, and decomposition. Location TBD for specific RFP clause sub-requirements.
- ASSUMPTION: Design methodology narrative is distinct from construction methodology (DEL-07-01) and commissioning narrative (DEL-08-01); each has separate scoring within the 10-point Delivery Plan criterion.
- The 3-point scoring weight for design methodology (out of 10 for the full Delivery Plan) suggests evaluators are assessing process credibility, Owner responsiveness, and addenda integration — not technical design detail.
