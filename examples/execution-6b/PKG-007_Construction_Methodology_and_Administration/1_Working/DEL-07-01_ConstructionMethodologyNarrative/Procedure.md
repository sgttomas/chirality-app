## Steps

### Step 1 — Scope Clarification and Outline Development

Duration: 2–3 days

Action:

1. Read RFP Section 7.2 in full. Identify the seven required topic areas:
   - Health and safety plan
   - Staging of work
   - Permits, inspections and approvals
   - Budget control (including change management)
   - Schedule control
   - Communications
   - Quality management (QA/QC) and documentation

2. Note which topics RFP §7.2 provides explicit requirements for vs. which are header-only:
   - Explicit requirements: Health and Safety, Permits/Inspections, Schedule Control, QA/QC
   - Header only (proponent defines approach): Staging of Work, Budget Control, Communications

3. Cross-check Addendum 03 for construction-specific implications that must be addressed (sumps in all bays; 16 ft minimum overhead door heights; fire apparatus direct exhaust ventilation; backup generator minimum loads; 2" water fill stations; solar-capable roofing; 40 bunker gear lockers with room ventilation).

4. Develop a section outline with subsections for each of the seven topics. Estimate page allocation per section (total target: 8–12 pages depending on overall proposal page budget).

5. Confirm page allocation with Proposal Manager against overall proposal PDF size constraints (single PDF under 15 MB per RFP §4.2).

Deliverable: Section outline with seven subsections, page estimates, and construction implications checklist.

---

### Step 2 — Site Logistics and Staging Analysis

Duration: 3–4 days

Action:

1. Review site plan (DEL-02-02): building footprints, site access from Waskasoo Avenue North, parking layout, Cold Storage building location, stormwater pond and flood fringe (8 acres not available for staging).

2. Review site conditions (DEL-10-02): 2021 geotechnical findings (soil conditions, foundation approach, dewatering requirements), wetland buffer constraints, flood zone implications, site grading status.

3. Develop a preliminary construction staging sequence:
   - Phase 1: Mobilization, site clearing, temporary utilities, construction fencing
   - Phase 2: Earthworks, grading, main building foundations
   - Phase 3: Cold Storage building foundations (parallel track, offset ~3 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Main building structural frame and envelope
   - Phase 5: Cold Storage frame and envelope
   - Phase 6: MEP rough-in (both buildings)
   - Phase 7: Interior finishes, site work, landscaping, commissioning preparation

   ASSUMPTION: Specific phase durations and sequencing to be confirmed during 20-day post-award baseline schedule development; the proposal narrative describes the framework.

4. Identify material staging areas within the 12-acre parcel (east portion, outside building footprints, clear of flood fringe). Confirm with site plan.

5. Identify equipment staging (crane, concrete pump, aerial lifts) and access constraints. Consider ground loading limitations and swing radii.

6. Develop traffic management framework: on-site delivery flows, off-site supplier routes, coordination with Town of Penhold if street access is required.

7. Address utility coordination: temporary power and water during construction; tie-in sequencing for permanent services.

Deliverable: Staging sequence (seven phases), site logistics framework, materials and equipment staging notes.

---

### Step 3 — Permits, Inspections and Approvals Schedule

Duration: 2–3 days

Action:

1. Develop a permit checklist by category. For each permit, identify the responsible party (CM or trade-specific) and preliminary timeline:

   | Permit Category | Responsible Party | Preliminary Timeline |
   |---|---|---|
   | Building Permit (Town of Penhold) | CM | Submit at ~90% design; allow 4–6 weeks for approval (ASSUMPTION — confirm with Town) |
   | Electrical Permit | Electrical subtrade | Coordinate with building permit; trade-specific |
   | Mechanical Permit (gas, HVAC, ventilation) | Mechanical subtrade | Coordinate with building permit; trade-specific |
   | Plumbing Permit | Plumbing subtrade | Coordinate with building permit |
   | Utility connection permits (water, sanitary, electrical) | CM / utility providers | Timeline per utility company requirements |
   | Environmental / grading approvals | CM / civil subconsultant | If applicable per site conditions; TBD |

   ASSUMPTION: Specific permit types and durations reflect standard Alberta AHJ process; confirmation with Town of Penhold post-award.

2. Develop a preliminary inspection schedule aligned to construction phases:
   - Foundation inspection (structural engineer + AHJ)
   - Frame inspection (structural engineer + AHJ)
   - MEP rough-in inspections (mechanical, electrical, plumbing — separately as required)
   - Final building inspection (AHJ)
   - Owner final walkthrough / Substantial Performance inspection (PM, CM, design lead, Owner, AHJ)

3. Confirm that permit application timing aligns with design completion milestones (permits typically require 90% design documentation at minimum). Cross-reference with DEL-09-01 for design milestone dates.

4. Confirm responsibility for all re-work and subsequent inspection costs rests with the Design-Builder (per RFP §7.2).

Deliverable: Permit checklist with responsible parties and preliminary timeline; preliminary inspection schedule.

---

### Step 4 — Budget Control and Change Management Process

Duration: 2–3 days

Action:

1. Establish the cost tracking structure:
   - Reference the Cost Breakdown (Schedule B, DEL-01-05) for WBS categories
   - Align cost codes to proposal estimate structure (Site Prep, Foundations, Main Building, Cold Storage, MEP, Finishes, Site Works, etc.)
   - Define tracking categories and reporting hierarchy

2. Define contingency allocation strategy:
   - Identify total contingency amount (TBD — derived from proposal estimate)
   - Decide allocation approach (management reserve vs. distributed per trade package)
   - Define drawdown approval authority (PM vs. Owner)
   - Define what contingency covers vs. what requires a change order (e.g., contingency covers minor field variations; Owner-directed scope changes require a formal change order)

3. Define the change order process:
   - Trigger: Owner instruction, site discovery, design optimization, RFP interpretation
   - Step 1 — Change request submitted
   - Step 2 — CM and affected consultant assess cost and schedule impact within 3 business days
   - Step 3 — PM presents options to Owner with recommendation
   - Step 4 — Authorization (threshold: TBD — to be defined by Design-Builder organization; typical range $15,000–$25,000 for PM vs. Owner approval)
   - Step 5 — Change order issued; baseline updated; monthly reporting reflects change

4. Define cost reporting to Owner:
   - Monthly cost report: work invoiced to date, budget vs. actual, forecast to completion, approved change order log
   - Internal tracking: variance threshold that triggers management review

Deliverable: Budget control and change management process description with WBS categories, contingency strategy, change order workflow, and reporting protocol.

---

### Step 5 — Schedule Control and 20-Day Baseline Development Process

Duration: 2–3 days

Action:

1. Describe the 20-day baseline schedule development process per RFP §7.2:
   - Day 1–5: Kick-off meeting with PM, Construction Manager, design lead, and key subtrades to confirm scope, durations, long-lead equipment, and dependency chains
   - Day 5–12: Gantt chart drafted with critical path identified
   - Day 12–17: Draft schedule circulated to Project Committee for review
   - Day 17–20: Revisions incorporated; baseline finalized and submitted

   ASSUMPTION: The proposal narrative describes the process; the actual Gantt chart is the artifact of DEL-09-01.

2. Identify long-lead items and critical path risks:
   - Structural steel fabrication
   - Mechanical/HVAC units and overhead door systems (16 ft height units)
   - Backup generator (diesel standby, outdoor)
   - Design review and building permit approval timeline

3. Describe the monthly update protocol per RFP §7.2:
   - Frequency: monthly, to the Project Manager
   - Content: % completion per task; approved Change Orders incorporated; forecast to completion
   - Rebaselining trigger: cumulative delay beyond acceptable threshold (TBD — define in narrative)
   - Recovery protocol: if critical path at risk, propose recovery action to Project Committee

4. Address the RFP's "NOT schedule-driven" philosophy: note that phasing and sequencing can be optimized for cost and value; the baseline schedule reflects realistic, cost-optimized construction, not maximum compression.

Deliverable: Schedule development process description with 20-day workshop plan, critical path risks, monthly update protocol, and schedule philosophy statement.

---

### Step 6 — Communications Framework

Duration: 1–2 days

Action:

1. Define meeting types and frequency (framework level; detail deferred to DEL-07-04):
   - Weekly site meetings: CM + active subtrades + Owner rep (if on site)
   - Bi-weekly or monthly progress meetings: PM + Owner/Project Committee + key consultants
   - Agenda issued in advance; minutes distributed within agreed timeframe

2. Define progress reporting:
   - Monthly progress report to Owner: work completed, schedule status, cost status, top risks, 30-day priorities
   - Cross-reference to DEL-07-04 for detailed format and template

3. Define escalation procedure (three levels):
   - Level 1: Site issue — CM resolves with subtrade; same day
   - Level 2: Cost/schedule impact or Owner decision required — PM engaged within 1 business day; Owner response within 3 business days
   - Level 3: Strategic issue — PM escalates to Owner leadership and design lead; resolution within 1 week

4. Confirm cross-reference language to DEL-07-04 in the narrative draft.

Deliverable: Communications framework with meeting types, reporting summary, and escalation levels.

   - Cross-discipline coordination checks
   - Consultant sign-off process at each milestone

3. Describe construction QC (framework level):
   - Site inspections: weekly by CM; critical milestone inspections by design engineers
   - Milestone inspections: Foundation, Frame, MEP rough-in, Final — attended by Owner rep and AHJ inspector as applicable
   - Non-conformance log and resolution protocol

4. Describe documentation standards:
   - NMS format for documents
   - Document numbering scheme (e.g., RFI-XXX, CO-XXX, IR-XXX)
   - Document control by CM; distribution log maintained
   - Confirm cross-reference to DEL-07-05 for detailed procedures

### Production Timeline Summary

**Aggregate Production Duration:** Approximately 20–28 working days across Steps 1–10 (assuming some parallelism between steps). Key scheduling notes:

- Steps 1–7 (content development) can partially overlap; realistic elapsed time is 14–20 working days
- Step 8 (integration check) requires all content sections to be drafted; 1–2 days sequential
- Step 9 (review cycles) requires 3–5 days including review circulation time; this is often the critical path bottleneck
- Step 10 (formatting and submission) is 1 day and must align with the master proposal assembly deadline

**Relation to Proposal Submission Deadline:** The production schedule must be back-planned from the proposal submission date. If the RFP closing date is known, the Construction Manager should work with the Proposal Manager to establish section draft deadlines that feed into the overall proposal assembly schedule. Production of this narrative should begin no later than 4 weeks before submission to allow adequate review time. (**ASSUMPTION:** Specific proposal deadline per RFP; Source: Proposal Manager; _SEMANTIC_LENSING X-003)

---

### Step 10 — Format and Submit

Duration: 1 day

Action:

1. Apply proposal document template (font, heading styles, logo, page numbers, headers/footers).

2. Insert any supporting diagrams:
   - Site staging diagram (reference to site plan in DEL-02-02)
   - Organizational chart showing H&S authority chain
   - Change order process flowchart (if page budget allows)

3. Final proofing: spelling, grammar, cross-reference accuracy, page count.

4. Incorporate finalized section into master proposal PDF.

5. Version control: DEL-07-01_ConstructionMethodologyNarrative_vFINAL.

6. Archive: final document and supporting work products in project folder.

Deliverable: Construction Methodology Narrative incorporated into master proposal PDF.
