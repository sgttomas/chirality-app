# Guidance — DEL-07-01: Construction Methodology Narrative

---

## Purpose

**Why This Deliverable Exists:**

The Construction Methodology Narrative (DEL-07-01) is a scored proposal section that demonstrates to the Evaluation Committee that the Design-Builder has a credible, realistic, and well-coordinated approach to executing the construction phase of the Public Services Building. It responds directly to RFP Section 7.2.

**Evaluation Context (OBJ-002 — 10 pts total; construction methodology = 3 pts):**

The evaluators are assessing whether the proponent can realistically deliver on what is promised. They want to see:

- A pragmatic understanding of site constraints, logistics, and construction sequencing
- Clear governance of health and safety with explicit Prime Contractor authority under Alberta OH&S
- Realistic and complete permitting and inspection coordination
- Disciplined budget control and change management
- A credible process for developing and maintaining the project schedule
- Structured communications and escalation procedures
- Quality management and documentation rigor consistent with industry standards

**Scoring Emphasis Allocation (ASSUMPTION — Proposal Manager decision):**

The construction methodology sub-criterion is worth 3 points out of 10 for OBJ-002. Not all seven topic areas carry equal weight in the evaluator's assessment. To allocate narrative emphasis effectively:

- **Higher emphasis (explicit RFP requirements):** Health and Safety, Permits/Inspections/Approvals, Schedule Control, and QA/QC have explicit RFP requirements with testable elements (Prime Contractor designation, 20-day baseline, professional seal, etc.). These topics are more likely to produce scoring differentiation because evaluators can verify concrete commitments.
- **Moderate emphasis (proponent-defined approach):** Budget Control (including Change Management) and Staging of Work are header-only topics where the proponent demonstrates judgment and project-specific thinking. Depth here shows competence but the scoring basis is less prescriptive.
- **Lower emphasis (framework only):** Communications is the topic most likely to be covered at a summary level with detail deferred to DEL-07-04; over-investing page count here risks crowding out higher-value topics.

**ASSUMPTION:** This emphasis allocation is a strategic recommendation based on RFP structure analysis. The Proposal Manager should confirm the emphasis allocation against the overall proposal strategy and any evaluation committee intelligence.

**Project Context:**

- Design-Build delivery per CCDC 14-2013 (as modified by Appendix J)
- Integrated Fire Hall + Public Works Operations facility + Cold Storage building on 12-acre developable site
- Schedule philosophy is NOT schedule-driven (RFP); proponents may optimize for cost/value
- Addendum 03 introduces significant program clarifications (sumps, 16 ft doors, direct exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar-capable roof, 40 bunker gear lockers) that affect construction complexity

## Principles

**P-001 — Source Fidelity**

Ground all statements in RFP requirements, site conditions (per reference reports), or industry best practice. Where judgment is applied (e.g., specific sequencing approach, contingency percentage), label it as ASSUMPTION and provide rationale. Do not assert claims that cannot be supported.

- Source: 4_DOCUMENTS PROTOCOL §SPEC; RFP §7.2

**P-002 — Site Awareness**

The narrative shall demonstrate understanding of the specific project and site characteristics:

- 12-acre developable site with 8 acres in flood fringe (stormwater pond + dog park area)
- Combined Fire Hall + Public Works + shared spaces with Cold Storage building (60' x 100')
- Single primary site access from Waskasoo Avenue North
- Geotechnical conditions per existing 2021 report (no additional investigation planned per DEC-013)
- Addendum 03 construction implications: bays require sumps; 16 ft minimum overhead door heights; direct exhaust ventilation for fire apparatus bays; backup generator; 2" fill stations; solar-capable roofing

- Source: RFP §7.2; Decomposition §4; Addendum 03

**P-003 — Regulatory Clarity**

Demonstrate explicit acknowledgment of regulatory requirements:

- Alberta Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations (Prime Contractor responsibility is a legal obligation, not a choice)
- CCDC 14-2013 as modified by Appendix J
- Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) permitting and inspection process
- National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and Alberta Building Code (ABC) compliance

- Source: RFP §7.2 (introductory paragraph and H&S bullet)

**P-003a — Terminology: "Project Manager" Disambiguation**

The term "Project Manager" is used in the RFP and across these documents to refer to two distinct roles. To avoid confusion in the drafted narrative:

- **Owner's Project Manager (Owner's PM):** The individual designated by the Owner/Town to receive submissions, review deliverables, and authorize changes. RFP §7.2 references (e.g., "submit to the Project Manager") refer to this role. Specification R-011 and R-012 use "Project Manager" in this sense.
- **Design-Builder's Project Manager (DB PM):** The Design-Builder's internal project lead who integrates sections, coordinates the team, and serves as the primary point of contact with the Owner's PM. Procedure Team Composition and Guidance P-004 reference this role.

When drafting the narrative, use "Owner's Project Manager" or "the Project Manager (Owner's representative)" for the RFP-defined role, and "Design-Builder's Project Manager" or the individual's name/title for the internal role. If the RFP term is quoted verbatim, retain "Project Manager" and add a parenthetical clarification on first use. (Source: RFP §7.2 terminology; _SEMANTIC_LENSING F-002)

**P-004 — Coordination and Integration**

The Construction Methodology does not stand alone. The narrative shall cross-reference and be consistent with:

- DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration) — day-to-day administration supporting the methodology
- DEL-07-04 (Meetings and Reporting) — meeting protocol and progress reporting structure
- DEL-07-05 (Quality Management) — QA/QC procedures and documentation standards
- DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) — 20-day baseline schedule and critical path
- DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions) — site constraints informing staging, H&S, and permitting

- Source: Decomposition §9, PKG-007 scope definition; cross-reference deliverable list

**P-005 — Parsimony Over Volume**

The proposal is not a construction management manual. It is a concise, scored demonstration of competence. Focus on:

- Strategy and philosophy, not procedural detail
- Site-specific or project-specific considerations (not generic boilerplate)
- Governance, authority, and escalation chains
- Key integrations, checkpoints, and commitments

Boilerplate language ("we are committed to safety and quality") without substance will not score well. Site-specific and project-specific language will.

**P-005a — Framework vs. Detail: Proposal-Stage Boundary**

Multiple procedure steps and considerations use "framework level" and "detail deferred to DEL-07-XX" language, but the threshold for what constitutes an adequate "framework" for scoring purposes is not defined in the RFP. Use the following guideline:

- **Framework level (adequate for this proposal narrative):** The narrative names the process or system, states the governing principle, identifies the responsible party, and provides one or two concrete, site-specific examples of how it will work on this project. The evaluator can conclude that the proponent has a credible plan.
- **Detail level (deferred to post-award or companion deliverable):** Specific templates, forms, checklists, sub-procedures, numerical thresholds, and day-by-day operational instructions. These add volume without scoring value and should be deferred to DEL-07-02 through DEL-07-05 or to post-award plan development.

**Test:** If a topic subsection could be dropped into any design-build proposal without modification, it is too generic and needs project-specific detail. If it reads like an operations manual, it has too much detail for the proposal stage.

**ASSUMPTION:** The distinction between "framework" and "detail" is a Proposal Manager judgment call informed by page budget and scoring strategy. (Source: Proposal Manager / evaluation strategy; _SEMANTIC_LENSING E-002)

**P-006 — Realism and Credibility**

Evaluators assess whether they believe the proponent can deliver. Avoid overambitious timelines or unsupported claims. Include:

- Realistic timelines and resource assumptions
- Explicit acknowledgment of known risks and how they will be managed
- Cross-checks that show internal consistency (e.g., staging sequence aligns with permit timeline aligns with design delivery timeline)

## Considerations

**C-001 — Health and Safety: Governance Structure**

RFP §7.2 assigns Prime Contractor status to the Design-Builder under the Alberta OH&S Act. The narrative must clearly articulate:

- Who holds Prime Contractor authority (title and role — typically the Construction Manager)
- How subtrades are held accountable to the site H&S plan
- Mandatory induction/training required before site access
- Incident reporting and escalation to Prime Contractor
- Emergency contact chain and emergency services coordination

The required H&S Plan elements per RFP §7.2 are:
1. Construction site access controls
2. Training plans
3. Muster points
4. Emergency procedures
5. Specific site challenges

ASSUMPTION: A full detailed H&S Plan will be developed post-award once the site is fully designed and surveyed. The proposal narrative describes the framework and governance structure.

- Source: RFP §7.2, Health and Safety bullet

**C-002 — Site Logistics and Staging**

The 12-acre site contains both the main building and Cold Storage building. The staging approach must account for:

- Material storage zones (steel, concrete, MEP materials, finishes) within the 12-acre parcel
- Equipment staging (tower crane, concrete pump, aerial lifts) — swing radii, ground loading constraints
- Traffic flow on site (delivery routes, unloading areas, worker parking)
- Site access from Waskasoo Avenue North — single primary access; traffic management during peak phases
- Flood fringe constraint (8 acres not available for staging — stormwater pond and dog park area)
- Erosion control and dewatering if required per geotechnical report conditions

ASSUMPTION: Specific staging zones will be determined during the 20-day baseline schedule development process post-award; the proposal narrative provides a framework and identifies the key considerations.

- Source: RFP §7.2, Staging bullet; Addendum 03 §1.1 (12-acre developable site); Decomposition §4

**C-003 — Permits and Inspections**

The Design-Builder bears full responsibility for all permits, inspections, re-work, and subsequent inspection costs (RFP §7.2). Construction in Alberta typically requires:

- Building Permit (Town of Penhold — AHJ)
- Electrical Permit
- Mechanical Permit (gas, ventilation, HVAC)
- Plumbing Permit
- Utility disconnection/connection permits
- Any grading, drainage, or environmental permits applicable to the site

The narrative should identify permit categories, assign responsibility (CM or trade-specific), and outline a preliminary timeline that aligns with design completion milestones.

ASSUMPTION: Specific permit requirements and durations reflect standard Alberta AHJ process; confirmation with Town of Penhold post-award.

- Source: RFP §7.2, Permits bullet; standard Alberta permitting practice (ASSUMPTION)

**C-004 — Budget Control and Change Management**

RFP §7.2 requires a narrative on budget control and change management but does not prescribe the approach. Key topics to address:

- Estimate baseline: the proposal price is based on conceptual design; how will cost accuracy improve as design develops?
- Change order process: Owner-requested, design-driven, or site-discovered changes. What are the authorization thresholds? How quickly can cost/schedule impact be assessed?
- Contingency allocation: Where is contingency held? What triggers drawdown? Who approves?
- Cost reporting to Owner: format, frequency, level of detail

For a fixed-price Design-Build contract (CCDC 14), the Design-Builder carries most cost risk. The narrative should demonstrate that the change management process protects both the Owner (visibility into cost) and the Design-Builder (timely authorization before proceeding with change work).

- Source: RFP §7.2, Budget Control bullet; CCDC 14-2013 contract framework

**C-005 — Schedule Control and the 20-Day Baseline**

RFP §7.2 explicitly requires the Design-Builder to submit a detailed project schedule within 20 calendar days of contract award. This schedule:

- Is reviewed by the Project Committee
- Once accepted, becomes the baseline for the project
- Becomes part of the Master Project Schedule
- Is updated monthly with % completion per task and Change Orders

The narrative must describe the process by which this baseline will be developed (participants, workshop, inputs), not just commit to the 20-day deadline. Key schedule risks to acknowledge:

- Long-lead items: structural steel fabrication, mechanical/HVAC units, generator, specialty doors
- Design-permit-construction dependency chain: cannot begin construction without building permit; cannot apply for permit without sufficient design completion
- RFP Schedule Philosophy: "NOT schedule-driven" — phasing can be optimized for cost/quality

ASSUMPTION: The proposal narrative describes the schedule development process; the actual Gantt chart with milestone dates is the artifact of DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule).

- Source: RFP §7.2, Schedule Control bullet; Decomposition §1 (schedule philosophy)

**C-006 — Communications**

RFP §7.2 requires a communications approach narrative but does not prescribe the structure. Effective construction communications for a project of this scale typically include:

- Regular site meetings (CM + active trades)
- Progress meetings (PM + Owner/Project Committee)
- Monthly written progress reports
- Escalation procedure for decisions and issues

The Construction Methodology narrative should provide a high-level communications framework. Detailed meeting agenda structure, minutes templates, and reporting formats are addressed in DEL-07-04 (Meetings and Reporting Narrative).

ASSUMPTION: The level of detail in the Communications subsection of this narrative is summary/framework level; detailed protocol in DEL-07-04.

- Source: RFP §7.2, Communications bullet; RFP §7.3.5 (Meetings and Reporting)

**C-007a — Inspection Terminology: Consistent Taxonomy**

Multiple inspection-related terms are used across the documents. To ensure consistency in the drafted narrative, the following taxonomy should be applied:

| Term | Definition | Used In |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily site observation** | Routine daily walk-through by the Site Superintendent; not a formal inspection event | Guidance EX-005 layer 1; Procedure Step 7 item 2 |
| **Milestone inspection** | Formal inspection by the design engineer(s) of record at defined construction milestones (foundation, frame, MEP rough-in, final completion); a quality gate that must be passed before the next phase begins | Guidance EX-005 layer 2; Procedure Step 7 item 3 |
| **AHJ inspection** | Statutory inspection by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (Town of Penhold building inspector) at prescribed stages; required for permit compliance | Specification R-006 to R-008; Procedure Step 3 |
| **Owner walkthrough** | Formal walk-through by the Owner/Owner's PM at milestone inspections and at Substantial Performance; an evaluation and acceptance event, not a code inspection | Guidance EX-005 layer 3; Procedure Step 3 |
| **OH&S audit/inspection** | Periodic or unannounced inspection by Alberta OH&S officers to verify compliance with the Act; distinct from construction quality inspections | Procedure V-003a |

When drafting the narrative, use these terms consistently. Avoid interchangeable use of "milestone inspection," "critical milestone inspection," and "AHJ inspection" — they serve different purposes and are performed by different parties. (Source: Construction Manager / QA Lead; _SEMANTIC_LENSING X-002)

**C-008 — Weather and Seasonal Construction Constraints**

No document currently addresses seasonal or weather constraints on construction despite the project being located in central Alberta where winter construction is a significant factor. Key considerations:

- **Winter concrete work:** Cold-weather concrete placement requires heated enclosures, insulated forms, and extended curing times; affects foundation and slab scheduling
- **Frost and ground conditions:** Excavation and earthworks may be restricted or more costly during freeze periods (typically November through March); material staging areas may require frost protection
- **Steel erection:** Wind and temperature limits on crane operations and steel erection per OH&S requirements
- **Envelope closure:** Achieving building envelope closure before winter onset is a critical scheduling goal to enable interior trades to work through winter months
- **Worker safety in cold weather:** Alberta OH&S cold-stress exposure limits; requirement for heated shelter, warm-up breaks, and appropriate PPE; affects H&S Plan content
- **Scheduling implications:** The seven-phase staging sequence (Procedure Step 2) should account for seasonal windows — site preparation and earthworks ideally in spring/summer; envelope closure targeted before freeze-up

**ASSUMPTION:** Specific seasonal constraints and mitigation strategies depend on contract award date and construction start timing, which are TBD at proposal stage. The narrative should acknowledge seasonal factors and demonstrate awareness of Alberta winter construction management. (Source: Site conditions; Alberta climate; _SEMANTIC_LENSING C-003)

**C-007 — Quality Management and Documentation**

RFP §7.2 requires a Quality Management (QA/QC) and Documentation narrative. Key explicit requirements:

- All work to current industry standards and good construction Best Practice
- All applicable codes, regulations, standards, trade associations, and local by-laws
- Work in accordance with manufacturer's instructions by qualified/licensed trade professionals
- NMS format recommended for all project documents — **Note on enforceability:** RFP §7.2 uses "recommended" language for NMS format, not "required." However, documents across this deliverable set oscillate between treating NMS as a recommendation and a de facto requirement (Specification R-016 says "recommended"; Procedure Step 7 says "NMS format for documents" without the "recommended" qualifier). **For consistency, treat NMS as the default document format standard with the understanding that RFP language is "recommended" — deviation should be justified if chosen, but NMS is the expected standard.** (Source: RFP §7.2 QA/QC bullet; _SEMANTIC_LENSING C-001)
- Alberta-registered professional must seal all construction and change documents

The narrative should distinguish:
- Design QC (design reviews, consultant certifications, coordination checks)
- Construction QC (site inspections at critical milestones, non-conformance management)
- Documentation standards (NMS format, document numbering, control, archival)

Detailed QA/QC procedures and document control protocols are addressed in DEL-07-05 (Quality Management Narrative).

## Trade-offs

**T-001 — Detailed H&S Plan vs. Framework Narrative**

Option A: Produce a comprehensive site-specific H&S Plan within the proposal.
Option B: Outline the H&S framework and governance; produce detailed plan post-award.

Recommended: Option B. RFP §7.2 requests a project-specific H&S plan *narrative*; a comprehensive H&S plan cannot be finalized without final site design and survey data. Proposal describes framework; detailed plan is a post-award deliverable. This is industry standard practice.

**T-002 — Contingency Strategy**

Option A: Single management reserve, allocated case-by-case.
Option B: Contingency distributed as percentages within major trade packages.
Option C: Hybrid — core management reserve plus trade-level allocations.

Recommended: Option C. Provides transparency to the Owner and flexibility for the Design-Builder. Clearly articulate the strategy and drawdown approval process.

**T-003 — Construction Phasing vs. Parallel Tracking**

Option A: Fully sequential — design complete, then permit, then construct.
Option B: Phased overlap — early site work and foundations proceed while design for upper floors continues.
Option C: Aggressive parallel — multiple work fronts simultaneously from early in the project.

Recommended: Option B. Design-build allows phased starts; site prep, utility extensions, and foundations can proceed before all construction documents are finalized. This is a key advantage of design-build delivery and should be highlighted in the narrative as demonstrating value.

**Rationale for Seven-Phase Staging Sequence (Supplementary to T-003):**

The seven-phase sequence presented in Guidance C-002 and Procedure Step 2 (Mobilization; Main Foundations; Cold Storage Foundations; Main Frame/Envelope; Cold Storage Frame/Envelope; MEP Rough-in; Finishes/Site Work) reflects the following trade-off reasoning:

- **Cold Storage offset (~3 weeks):** The Cold Storage building (60' x 100') shares no structural connection with the main building but shares site access, equipment (crane, concrete), and crews. A ~3-week offset avoids equipment and crew congestion at the foundation stage without requiring separate mobilization. Running fully concurrent would overload the single site access from Waskasoo Avenue North; running fully sequential would extend the overall timeline unnecessarily.
- **Parallel envelope closure:** By offsetting Cold Storage, the main building can achieve envelope closure first, enabling interior trades to begin in the main building while Cold Storage envelope is completed — this is particularly important for winter construction (see C-008).
- **MEP consolidation:** MEP rough-in for both buildings is grouped in Phase 6 to allow mechanical/electrical subtrades to work across both buildings efficiently with continuous crew presence on site.

**ASSUMPTION:** The specific phase durations and exact offset timing are Construction Manager judgment pending 20-day baseline schedule development; the seven-phase structure is a framework presented for evaluation purposes. (Source: Construction Manager judgment; site constraints; _SEMANTIC_LENSING D-001)

**T-004 — Communications Detail in this Narrative vs. DEL-07-04**

Risk: Over-detailing the communications section here duplicates DEL-07-04 content and adds page count without scoring benefit.

Recommended: Keep the Communications subsection here at a framework level (meeting types, reporting frequency, escalation philosophy). Direct evaluators to the detailed meeting and reporting structure in the companion narrative. Ensure cross-reference language is explicit.

## Examples

The following examples illustrate the tone, depth, and style appropriate for the Construction Methodology Narrative. These are scaffolds, not templates — actual content must be project-specific.

**EX-001 — Health and Safety (Prime Contractor Authority)**

> The Design-Builder's Construction Manager holds Prime Contractor authority and responsibility for all site health and safety per the Alberta Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. All subtrades and workers are required to complete a mandatory site induction before commencing work, covering hazard identification, emergency procedures, and incident reporting protocol. The H&S Plan (to be finalized post-award upon completion of detailed site design) will specifically address: site access gate controls, confined space entry for sump areas, working at height during steel erection and roofing, generator operation and fuel storage, and coordination between fire apparatus bay activities and general construction. Muster points are identified on the site logistics plan; emergency contact numbers are posted at site entry and the site office.

- Demonstrates: site awareness (sumps, apparatus bays, generator), Prime Contractor language, phased plan approach

**EX-002 — Staging Sequence (Framework)**

> Construction is staged in seven phases: (1) Mobilization and site preparation — site clearing, layout, temporary utility connections, and construction fencing; (2) Earthworks and foundations — grading, compaction, and main building foundation per geotechnical recommendations from the 2021 investigation report; (3) Cold Storage building foundations; (4) Main building structural frame and building envelope; (5) Cold Storage frame and envelope; (6) Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing rough-in across both buildings; (7) Interior finishes, site work, landscaping, and pre-commissioning. Main building and Cold Storage are tracked on parallel schedules offset by approximately three weeks to avoid equipment and crew congestion. Material staging areas are located in the east portion of the 12-acre parcel, outside the building footprints and clear of the identified flood fringe.

- Demonstrates: logical sequencing, Cold Storage coordination, flood fringe awareness, practical logistics

**EX-003 — Schedule Control (20-Day Baseline Process)**

> Within 20 calendar days of contract award, the Design-Builder will submit a detailed baseline project schedule to the Project Manager for Project Committee review. The schedule development process: Day 1–5, kick-off meeting with PM, Construction Manager, design lead, and key subtrades (civil, structural, mechanical, electrical) to confirm scope, durations, long-lead equipment, and dependency chains; Day 5–12, Gantt chart drafted in [scheduling software] with critical path identified; Day 12–17, circulated to Owner and Project Committee for review and comment; Day 17–20, revisions incorporated and baseline finalized. Once accepted by the Project Committee, this schedule forms the Master Project Schedule baseline. Monthly updates report percentage completion per task and incorporate all approved Change Orders.

- Demonstrates: 20-day requirement acknowledged, credible development process, Project Committee role, monthly update commitment

**EX-004 — Change Order Process**

> Change requests arising from Owner instructions, site discoveries, or design optimization are assessed within 3 business days of receipt. The Construction Manager and affected design consultant develop a scope, cost, and schedule impact assessment. Changes under $[authorization threshold] are authorized by the Project Manager; changes over this threshold require Owner approval before proceeding. All authorized changes are issued as formal change orders, and the project cost and schedule baselines are updated accordingly. Monthly cost reports to the Owner include a running change order log with cumulative cost and schedule impact.

**EX-005 — QA/QC (Construction Phase)**

> Construction quality is maintained through a three-layer inspection regime: (1) daily site observation by the Site Superintendent; (2) critical milestone inspections by the structural engineer, mechanical engineer, and electrical engineer at foundation, frame, MEP rough-in, and final completion phases; (3) Owner and AHJ inspections at each of the above milestones plus occupancy inspection. Non-conformances are logged with corrective action requirements and a re-inspection date. No subsequent phase commences until the previous milestone inspection is satisfactorily completed and documented. All documents, reports, and change records are formatted and numbered per NMS standards as agreed with the Owner at project kick-off. A professional Architect/Engineer registered in Alberta seals all construction and change documents.
