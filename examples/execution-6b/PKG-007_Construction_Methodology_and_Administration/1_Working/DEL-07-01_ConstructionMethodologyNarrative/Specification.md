---

## Scope

**In Scope:**

The Construction Methodology Narrative (DEL-07-01) is a scored proposal section that articulates the Design-Builder's project-specific approach to executing the construction phase of the Public Services Building in compliance with RFP Section 7.2. The narrative addresses seven required topic domains:

1. **Health and Safety Plan** — Alberta OH&S Act compliance; Prime Contractor responsibilities; site access, training plans, muster points, emergency procedures, and specific site challenges
2. **Staging of Work** — Construction sequencing, site logistics, material storage, equipment access, traffic management, utility coordination
3. **Permits, Inspections and Approvals** — Identification and management of all required permits; AHJ inspection coordination; responsibility for re-work and subsequent inspection costs
4. **Budget Control (including Change Management)** — Cost tracking methodology, change order process, contingency management, and cost reporting
5. **Schedule Control** — Post-award baseline schedule (20-day requirement); Project Committee acceptance; monthly updates with % completion per task and approved Change Orders
6. **Communications** — Project meeting structure, reporting cadence, escalation procedures, and stakeholder communication approach
7. **Quality Management (QA/QC) and Documentation** — Design QC, construction QC, documentation standards (NMS format recommended), professional seal requirements

**Out of Scope:**

- Detailed design documents (design phase deliverables, PKG-002 through PKG-006)
- Commissioning and closeout procedures (PKG-008)

- Detailed meeting agenda structure and minutes protocols (DEL-07-04)
- Detailed QA/QC procedures and document control protocols (DEL-07-05)
- Subconsultant discipline assignments and management approach (DEL-07-03)
- Actual Gantt chart and detailed milestone dates (DEL-09-01)

**Key Constraints:**

- Compliance with Alberta Occupational Health and Safety Act is mandatory (RFP §7.2)
- Design-Builder holds Prime Contractor status for all site H&S responsibilities (RFP §7.2)
- CCDC 14-2013 contract framework applies; Appendix J Supplementary Conditions modify standard CCDC 14 terms
- Baseline schedule must be submitted within 20 calendar days of contract award (RFP §7.2)
- Monthly schedule updates required throughout construction (RFP §7.2)
- NMS format recommended for all construction documents (RFP §7.2)

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification Method | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| R-001 to R-003 (H&S) | Checklist review against RFP §7.2 H&S bullet | All five H&S Plan elements present; Prime Contractor responsibility explicit; Alberta OH&S Act referenced |
| R-004 to R-005 (Staging) | Narrative review against 12-acre site plan | Staging sequence is logical; site logistics account for site constraints; not generic/boilerplate |
| R-006 to R-008 (Permits) | Narrative review; cross-check against standard Alberta permit types | Full-responsibility language present; utility connection ownership confirmed; permit categories identified; AHJ inspection acceptance criteria defined — narrative specifies what constitutes satisfactory completion of each inspection milestone and how rejection/re-inspection is tracked (Source: RFP §7.2 Permits bullet; _SEMANTIC_LENSING A-003) |
