## Requirements

### R-001: Required Discipline Confirmation
**Source:** RFP Section 7.3.4, page 22 of 72

The narrative shall identify and confirm subconsultants covering all required disciplines explicitly named in RFP §7.3.4:

| # | Discipline | RFP Language | Typical Scope for this Project |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Architectural | Named explicitly | Design lead, code compliance, construction administration, monthly inspections |
| 2 | Civil Engineering | Named explicitly | Site, utilities, grading, drainage, Appendix D-F review support |
| 3 | Structural Engineering | Named explicitly | Foundation design (USG1123 compatibility), structural systems, frame |
| 4 | Mechanical Engineering | Named explicitly | HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, apparatus bay exhaust, fill stations, generator |
| 5 | Electrical Engineering | Named explicitly | Power distribution, lighting, controls, IT/data, solar-ready provisions |
| 6 | Specialty Consultants | "as required" | As deemed necessary to meet code, regulations, or innovative methodology components |

Each named discipline position shall include, at minimum: the assigned firm or individual, their primary role, and a brief statement of relevant experience. Specific firm names are TBD (team-assembly dependent).

**Verification:** All six discipline categories present and addressed in narrative. Each named discipline entry shall include at minimum: (a) firm name, (b) lead individual name, (c) primary role for this project, and (d) brief statement of relevant experience. Verification checks both presence (all six categories) and content adequacy (all four elements per entry). Entries with TBD placeholders for firm name or individual are acceptable pre-team-assembly but must be resolved before submission.

---

### R-002: Design-Builder Accountability for Subconsultant Management
**Source:** RFP Section 7.3.4, page 22 of 72 (verbatim)

The narrative shall clearly state the Design-Builder's responsibility for:
- Carrying and managing additional subconsultants as deemed necessary
- Ensuring subconsultants complete work to meet **all code, acts, and regulatory requirements**
- Coordinating subconsultants to **satisfy innovative components** of the Design-Builder's proposed methodology

The narrative shall also acknowledge the inspection and certification obligations imposed on the consultant team by RFP page 21:
- Architect performs **monthly** site inspections and provides written reports with each progress draw
- Other disciplines perform inspections **as per the approved project schedule and at all critical milestones**
- At substantial performance, **each discipline** performs a site visit and issues a letter certifying construction is in general conformance with the Construction Documents

**ASSUMPTION:** The RFP does not specify the format for describing accountability (narrative vs. org chart). An organizational chart or responsibility table is recommended to satisfy this requirement clearly.

**Verification:** Narrative explicitly assigns regulatory compliance accountability to the Design-Builder; inspection and certification obligation described; coordination obligation for innovative methodology components acknowledged.

---

### R-003: Geotechnical and Topographic Information Review
**Source:** RFP Section 7.3.4, page 22 of 72; OSR Section 10.3.2, page 39 of 72; DEC-013

The narrative shall:
1. Confirm that the Design-Builder has reviewed the site-specific geotechnical investigation report and topographic information provided in **Appendix D-F**
2. Identify the specific report reviewed: Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File No. **USG1123**, dated **February 12, 2021**, prepared for Tagish Engineering Ltd. (original client), covering 18 boreholes (BH101–BH118) across the Penhold site
3. State the sufficiency determination: **existing 2021 report is sufficient** for design purposes (per DEC-013)
4. Explicitly state that **no additional geotechnical investigation is proposed or priced** in this proposal
5. Document key design assumptions to be relied upon from the existing report, including:
   - Frost penetration depth: **2.0 m** (USG1123 §5.5.1 — Penhold region historical data)
   - Groundwater table: approximately **3.0 m to 4.0 m** below grade (USG1123 §4.2 — piezometer measurements, February 2021)
   - Clay stratum characteristic: **CH — high plasticity clay**, NOT suitable as shallow foundation bearing stratum (USG1123 §4.1.5, §5 item 3)
   - Preferred bearing strata: native sand (ULS 300 kPa, SLS 100 kPa at >0.61 m depth) or native till (ULS 360 kPa, SLS 120 kPa at >2.0 m depth) (USG1123 §5.4)
   - Foundation options available: shallow foundations (on sand or till), driven steel pipe piles (min. embedment 5.3 m for unheated structures), screw piles (upper helix below 2.0 m frost depth) (USG1123 §5.2, §5.3, §5.4)
   - Sulphate exposure: Class S-2 — design concrete in contact with native/cohesive fill for severe sulphate levels; Type HS cement, min. 56-day compressive strength 32 MPa, max w/c ratio 0.45 (USG1123 §4.3, citing CAN/CSA A23.1-2014)
6. Acknowledge the USG1123 report limitation: the report was prepared for an earlier program concept (1,875 m² shop/office + 900 m² fire hall). If the building footprint or site layout differs materially from that concept, the structural or civil consultant shall confirm report applicability; if not applicable, a new investigation scope must be defined and DEC-013 revisited.

**Decision Authority:** DEC-013 (OI-004 closed): "No additional geotechnical investigation at this time. No pricing allowance for future investigation. Foundation design and site assessment will rely on existing 2021 geotechnical report only."

**Note on OSR language:** OSR §10.3.2 states that if the proponent finds the report insufficient, "the Design-Builder will be required to undertake and pay for additional geotechnical investigation as required." DEC-013 resolves this: the proponent's position is that no additional investigation is required. The narrative must make this position explicit and credible by stating the basis for the sufficiency determination.

**Verification:** Narrative confirms USG1123 reviewed; report identity (file no., date, firm, boreholes) stated; sufficiency stated with basis; key design assumptions listed; no additional investigation proposed or costed; USG1123 program limitation addressed.

---

### R-004: Team Management and Interface Coordination Approach
**Source:** RFP Section 7.3.4 (implied by "carry and manage" language); RFP page 21 (inspection obligations — explicit); standard Design-Build practice — ASSUMPTION for coordination protocols not explicitly stated

The narrative shall describe:
- How subconsultants are coordinated during the **design phase** (design lead, reporting frequency, approval authority, meeting cadence)
- How subconsultants are coordinated during the **construction phase** (inspection responsibilities, field reporting, progress draw reporting, milestone certifications)
- Interface protocols between discipline consultants, including at minimum:
  - Structural-Civil interface: foundation design and site grading coordination; USG1123 applicability confirmation
  - Mechanical-Electrical interface: building systems integration (generator, transfer switching, HVAC controls, solar-ready provisions)
  - Architectural-Mechanical interface: building envelope and mechanical penetrations
  - Structural-Mechanical interface: roof penetrations and equipment supports
- Escalation path for coordination conflicts

Interface coordination shall also account for project-specific amendments in **RFP Addendum 03**, including: apparatus bay sump integration affecting the Structural-Mechanical interface (Addendum 03 §1.8) and solar-ready electrical provisions affecting the Mechanical-Electrical interface (Addendum 03 §1.17). *(Source: Addendum 03 §1.8, §1.17; referenced in Procedure Step C items 3-4. B-002 enrichment.)*

**Verification:** Narrative describes design-phase and construction-phase coordination; inspection and certification obligations acknowledged per RFP page 21; at least three interface points identified; Addendum 03 interface requirements (§1.8 sump, §1.17 solar-ready) acknowledged in interface coordination.

---

### R-005: Consistency with Appendix I (Subtrade and Consultant List)
**Source:** RFP Appendix I; Decomposition DEL-01-09 cross-reference

All discipline consultant assignments named in this narrative shall be consistent with the entries in Appendix I (DEL-01-09):
- Firm names, discipline roles, and key personnel must match
- Any firm named here but not in Appendix I must be added to Appendix I prior to proposal submission
- No consultant may appear with conflicting role descriptions across the two documents

**Verification:** Cross-reference check against DEL-01-09 completed prior to submission (human reviewer action).

---

### R-006: Specialty Consultant Identification
**Source:** RFP Section 7.3.4 ("Specialty consultants as required"), page 22 of 72

The narrative shall address the specialty consultant category. The Design-Builder shall either:
- Name specific specialty consultants to be engaged (preferred for evaluation clarity), or
- State a defined approach for identifying and engaging specialty consultants based on design advancement, with examples of likely specialties

**ASSUMPTION:** Likely specialty consultants for this project type include: code consulting (Alberta Building Code plan review), fire protection engineering (if separate from mechanical consultant's scope), acoustic consulting (for apparatus bay noise management and community interface), and potentially geotechnical monitoring during construction (using original firm, Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., for field-condition verification — this does not constitute additional investigation and is consistent with DEC-013, as it is a construction-phase quality control measure, not a design-stage investigation).

**TBD — Fire Protection Engineering Scope Assignment (F-001):** The Datasheet lists fire protection under Mechanical Engineering (Conditions table, "Required Disciplines" row), Guidance C-003 Option 1 lists it as a potential separate specialty, and this requirement (R-006) lists it parenthetically as potentially separate from mechanical scope. A definitive scope assignment is required: either (a) fire protection engineering is within the Mechanical consultant's scope (no separate specialty needed), or (b) fire protection engineering is a separate specialty consultant. This is a regulated discipline in Alberta and the ambiguity could result in a regulatory gap if neither the Mechanical consultant nor a separate specialty consultant assumes explicit responsibility for fire protection engineering. Under the "Total Regulatory Dominion" lens, this question requires human/team input to resolve before proposal submission. See Guidance Conflict Table CT-002 for human ruling.

**Note on geotechnical monitoring:** Re-engaging Union Street Geotechnical Ltd. for construction-phase geotechnical monitoring (e.g., foundation bearing surface inspection per USG1123 §5.4 item 10: "A qualified geotechnical engineer must inspect all shallow foundation bearing surfaces prior to casting footings") is a prudent construction quality measure and is distinct from additional investigation. Naming this as a specialty service — within the DEC-013 framework — strengthens the narrative's credibility.

**Verification:** Specialty consultant category addressed; not left blank; any proposed geotechnical monitoring service clearly distinguished from additional investigation (DEC-013 scope).

## Standards

| Standard / Reference | Applicability | Notes |
|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| **RFP Section 7.3.4** | Normative — primary requirement | Specifies required disciplines and Design-Builder accountability for subconsultants |
| **RFP Page 21** | Normative — inspection obligations | Monthly architect inspections; discipline inspections per schedule; substantial performance certification letters |
| **OSR Section 10.3.2** | Normative — supporting clause | Confirms Design-Builder responsibility for geotechnical services; Appendix D source reference |
| **Alberta Building Code (ABC)** | Normative — implied by "all code, acts and regulatory requirements" in RFP §7.3.4 | All consultants must ensure ABC compliance within their discipline scope |
| **APEGA (Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta) / AAA (Alberta Association of Architects)** | Normative — implied by Alberta regulatory context | Engineering consultants must hold valid APEGA P.Eng. registration; architects must hold AAA registration. **TBD — pending confirmation of normative authority:** while APEGA and AAA licensing is standard practice for Alberta projects, no RFP clause explicitly mandates verification of professional registration at proposal stage. Human ruling required: confirm whether this is a deliverable requirement (with verification at proposal submission) or an assumed condition of engagement. (See Guidance Conflict Table CT-001.) **Note (A-001):** The normative status of professional licensing for this deliverable must be unambiguous. Either (a) confirm as a normative requirement with cited authority (e.g., APEGA Act, AAA Act) and add a verification mechanism (see R-001 supplemental verification below), or (b) explicitly flag as an assumed condition of engagement that does not require proposal-stage verification. The current "ASSUMPTION -- implied by Alberta regulatory context" label is insufficient for prescriptive direction -- it must resolve to a definitive position. |
| **CCDC 14-2013 + Appendix J** | Normative — contract form | Design-Builder's obligations to manage subconsultants derive from CCDC 14 as modified by Supplementary Conditions |
| **National Building Code of Canada (NBCC)** | Normative — referenced through ABC | Applicable indirectly through Alberta Building Code adoption |
| **CAN/CSA A23.1-2014** | Normative — concrete specification | Sulphate-resistant concrete requirements (Class S-2, Type HS cement) cited in USG1123 §4.3 |
| **RFP Addendum 03** | Normative — project-specific amendments | §1.8 (apparatus bay sump integration) and §1.17 (solar-ready electrical provisions) affect discipline interface coordination (R-004). Applicable sections referenced in Procedure Step C. |
| **USG1123 (Geotechnical Report)** | Reference — existing investigation | Foundation design values and conditions relied upon under DEC-013 |

| R-006: Specialty consultants addressed | Specialty category not blank; specific firms or defined engagement approach stated; geotechnical monitoring service (if proposed) distinguished from additional investigation | Proposal Reviewer |
| Dual scoring dimension coverage (E-002) | Narrative explicitly addresses both scoring dimensions: Construction Methodology (OBJ-002, 3 pts within 10 pt Project Delivery Plan) and Team Qualifications (OBJ-006, 15 pts). Narrative content is structured to demonstrably serve both evaluation objectives -- management/coordination content supports OBJ-002; team credentials and experience content supports OBJ-006. | Proposal Reviewer |
| R-001 (supplemental): Professional registration | All named discipline consultants hold valid APEGA P.Eng. (engineers/geoscientists) or AAA registration (architect) at time of proposal submission — **TBD pending human ruling on whether verification is required at proposal stage** (see Standards table APEGA/AAA row and Guidance Conflict Table CT-001). **Proposed verification mechanism (A-002):** If confirmed as a deliverable requirement, verify that each named engineering consultant holds current APEGA P.Eng. registration and the named architect holds current AAA registration. Verification may be performed by checking APEGA and AAA public registries or requesting current practice permit numbers from each firm. | Proposal Coordinator |
