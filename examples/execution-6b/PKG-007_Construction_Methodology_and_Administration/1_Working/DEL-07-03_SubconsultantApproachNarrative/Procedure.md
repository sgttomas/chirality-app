# Procedure: Subconsultant Approach Narrative

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps to produce, verify, and finalize the Subconsultant Approach Narrative for submission in response to RFP Section 7.3.4.

The narrative must:
1. Confirm all required discipline consultants are named and credentialed (six categories per RFP §7.3.4)
2. Demonstrate the Design-Builder's accountability for subconsultant management and regulatory compliance
3. Acknowledge the inspection and certification obligations imposed by RFP page 21
4. Provide a credible, explicit geotechnical sufficiency determination based on the existing 2021 report (USG1123) only
5. Be fully consistent with Appendix I (DEL-01-09) and Key Resumes (DEL-01-08)

## Steps

### Step A: Assemble and Confirm Required Discipline List

**Owner:** Proposal Manager / PM
**When:** As early in proposal development as possible; must be complete before Step D

**Actions:**
1. Compile the complete list of required disciplines per RFP §7.3.4:
   - Architectural (design lead + construction administration)
   - Civil Engineering (site, grading, utilities, drainage; USG1123 review support)
   - Structural Engineering (foundation design based on USG1123; structural systems)
   - Mechanical Engineering (HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, apparatus exhaust, fill stations, generator)
   - Electrical Engineering (power, lighting, controls, IT/data, solar-ready provisions)
   - Specialty (TBD — identify at least one likely specialty at this stage)
2. For each discipline, confirm:
   - Firm name and principal contact
   - Lead individual (if different from firm principal)
   - Primary responsibility scope for this project
   - Brief relevant experience statement (1–2 prior projects of similar type: fire hall, public works operations centre, or comparable municipal facility)
   - Confirmation of availability for this project (signed letter of intent or executed fee agreement)
3. Identify which discipline leads will be designated "key personnel" (requiring resumes in DEL-01-08).
4. Identify specialty consultant scope: determine whether specific specialties (e.g., code consulting, acoustic, fire protection engineering, geotechnical monitoring) are known at this stage. If not, define the approach for engaging them.
5. Cross-check the assembled list against DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) for consistency — firm names, discipline assignments, and roles must match exactly.

**Completion Check:** All six discipline categories confirmed; no gaps; all letters of intent or confirmations in hand.

### Step B: Conduct Geotechnical and Topographic Sufficiency Review

**Owner:** Structural Lead Consultant (primary) or Civil Lead Consultant (supporting)
**When:** Must be completed before Step D; findings documented in writing. **Timeline gate (X-001):** The geotechnical sufficiency memo must be in hand no later than **5 business days before the Step D drafting deadline** to allow adequate time for narrative incorporation and review. If the proposal development schedule has a fixed submission date, the PM shall set a calendar milestone for Step B completion and communicate it to the structural/civil consultant at engagement. Step B is critical-path for Step D -- delay in the sufficiency review directly delays narrative drafting. **ASSUMPTION: 5 business day buffer is best practice; actual timeline depends on proposal schedule.**

**Actions:**
1. Obtain and review the 2021 geotechnical investigation report: **Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File No. USG1123, February 12, 2021**. Key sections to review:

| USG1123 Section | Content to Review | Key Design Parameter |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| §1.1 Background | Program concept investigated (1,875 m² shop/office + 900 m² fire hall) | Confirm current program is materially consistent; if not, escalate to PM (see item 6 below) |
| §2.2 Proposed Structures | Report limitation clause: "If there are any changes...these changes should be reviewed by Union Street personnel" | Determine applicability to current building program |
| §3 Field Investigation | 18 boreholes (BH101–BH118); depths 3.05–12.65 m; investigation Jan 27–28, 2021 | Confirm borehole coverage is spatially adequate for proposed building footprint |
| §4.1 Stratigraphy | Topsoil (72 mm avg) / sand (~1.35 m) / clay (CH, high plasticity) / till (to max depth) | Identify bearing strata; confirm clay is NOT used as shallow foundation bearing |
| §4.2 Groundwater | Avg 4.14 m from piezometers (Feb 3, 2021); estimated 3.0–4.0 m below grade | Foundation design assumption for groundwater depth |
| §4.3 Sulphate Attack | Class S-2 severe sulphate; Type HS cement; min 32 MPa at 56 days; max w/c = 0.45 | Concrete specification requirement for all subgrade/below-grade concrete |
| §5.4 Shallow Foundations | Sand: ULS 300 kPa / SLS 100 kPa (>0.61 m depth); Till: ULS 360 kPa / SLS 120 kPa (>2.0 m depth); min footing depth 2.0 m if unheated/uninsulated | Bearing capacity design values |
| §5.2 Driven Steel Pipe Piles | Min embedment 5.3 m for unheated structures (frost jacking resistance); adfreezing stress = 100 kPa above 2.0 m depth | Pile embedment requirement |
| §5.3 Screw Piles | Upper helix must be below frost depth (2.0 m); φ = 0.4 compression, φ = 0.3 tension | Screw pile design requirements |
| §5.5.1 Frost Design | Frost penetration depth = **2.0 m** (Penhold region historical data) | Frost design basis for all foundation types and below-grade construction |
| §10 ABC Considerations | Alberta Building Code considerations from geotechnical perspective | Regulatory baseline |

2. Obtain topographic and site information (Appendix E-F) and review for site-specific conditions affecting foundation or site design (grading slopes, drainage patterns, proximity to Waskasoo Creek flood fringe).
3. Address the USG1123 program limitation (§2.2): state explicitly whether the current PSB building program (combined fire hall and public works operations centre, per RFP 2024_004) is materially consistent with the 2021 investigation concept. Document the basis for this determination.
4. Reach a formal sufficiency determination:
   - **If SUFFICIENT (expected per DEC-013):** Document basis — which data elements support this conclusion, which design assumptions will be carried forward (frost depth, groundwater, bearing capacities, sulphate class), and what risk management applies if field conditions differ.
   - **If INSUFFICIENT (contradicts DEC-013):** Escalate immediately to PM and Proposal Manager. This requires a formal scope decision review; DEC-013 may need to be revisited.
5. Document specific assumptions to be carried forward for foundation design:
   - Frost penetration depth: **2.0 m** (USG1123 §5.5.1)
   - Groundwater table: approximately **3.0 m to 4.0 m** below grade (USG1123 §4.2)
   - Clay stratum: HIGH PLASTICITY (CH) — not suitable as shallow foundation bearing (USG1123 §4.1.5, §5 item 3)
   - Shallow foundation on sand (if applicable): ULS **300 kPa**, SLS **100 kPa**, footing depth > 0.61 m (USG1123 §5.4 item 6)
   - Shallow foundation on till (preferred): ULS **360 kPa**, SLS **120 kPa**, footing depth > 2.0 m (USG1123 §5.4 item 8)
   - Sulphate class: **S-2** — Type HS cement, min 32 MPa (56-day), max w/c 0.45 (USG1123 §4.3, CAN/CSA A23.1-2014)
   - Pile embedment (driven pipe, unheated structures): min **5.3 m** (USG1123 §5.5.2)
   - Screw pile: upper helix below **2.0 m** frost depth (USG1123 §5.3)
6. Confirm that **no budget or schedule allowance** exists for additional geotechnical investigation anywhere in the proposal (cross-check with DEL-01-04/DEL-01-05 pricing).
7. Identify whether a construction-phase geotechnical monitoring service should be named as a specialty consultant engagement (foundation bearing surface inspection per USG1123 §5.4 item 10 — "A qualified geotechnical engineer must inspect all shallow foundation bearing surfaces prior to casting footings"). If so, confirm this is classified as construction quality control, not additional investigation, and is priced within construction administration.

**Output:** Written internal memo or email from structural/civil consultant to PM confirming: (a) sufficiency determination; (b) design assumptions carried forward; (c) USG1123 program limitation addressed; (d) risk management approach if field conditions differ; (e) no additional investigation budget.

**Completion Check:** Written sufficiency memo received; design assumptions documented per the table above; no additional investigation budget confirmed; USG1123 program limitation addressed.

### Step C: Define Subconsultant Management and Interface Approach

**Owner:** PM / Construction Manager
**When:** Concurrent with Step B; must be complete before Step D

**Actions:**
1. Define reporting and accountability structure:
   - Who is the Design-Builder's PM responsible for overall design quality and regulatory compliance?
   - How do subconsultants report to the PM during design phase? (e.g., bi-weekly design coordination meetings, monthly progress reports)
   - Who chairs design coordination meetings? (Recommended: Architectural lead)
   - What approval authority does each discipline lead have for their scope?
   - What is the escalation path for coordination conflicts? Escalation timeframes: discipline leads escalate coordination conflicts to PM within **24 hours** of identification; PM escalates to the Design-Builder principal if unresolved within **48 hours**. *(Source: Guidance EX-002; A-003 enrichment.)*
2. Define construction-phase coordination:
   - Who is the Construction Manager responsible for site administration?
   - How do discipline inspectors report to the CM?
   - What is the inspection schedule? Note explicit RFP page 21 requirements:
     - Architect: **monthly** site inspections + written reports with each progress draw
     - Other disciplines: inspections **per the approved project schedule and at all critical milestones**
     - Substantial performance: **each discipline** performs site visit and issues conformance letter
   - How are discipline certification letters at substantial performance managed and assembled?
3. Identify key inter-discipline interface points (minimum four):
   - **Structural–Civil interface:** foundation design and site grading coordination; joint review of USG1123 applicability to current building program; subgrade preparation per USG1123 §5.1
   - **Mechanical–Electrical interface:** building systems integration (generator, transfer switching, HVAC controls, solar-ready electrical provisions per Addendum 03 §1.17)
   - **Architectural–Mechanical interface:** building envelope and mechanical penetrations; frost protection below mechanical equipment slabs
   - **Structural–Mechanical interface:** roof penetrations, equipment supports, apparatus bay slab design for sump integration (Addendum 03 §1.8)
4. Align management approach with Construction Methodology (DEL-07-01) and Construction Administration (DEL-07-02) to avoid contradictions.

**Output:** Documented management structure (org chart, responsibility table, or narrative protocol) ready for incorporation into Step D.

**Completion Check:** Management structure documented; coordination protocols defined; RFP page 21 inspection obligation explicitly acknowledged; four interface points identified.

---

### Step D: Draft the Narrative Section

**Owner:** Proposal Writer / PM
**When:** After Steps A, B, and C are complete (or substantially complete)

**Actions:**
1. Structure the narrative using the following sequence:
   - **Introduction (1 paragraph):** Brief overview of team composition and role; Design-Builder's accountability statement
   - **Required Disciplines (table + brief narrative):** Discipline table (as per C-001 Option A in Guidance) plus 1–2 sentences on each discipline's relevant experience
   - **Management Structure (1–2 paragraphs):** Design-phase coordination; construction-phase coordination; inspection and certification obligations per RFP page 21
   - **Interface Coordination (1 paragraph):** Key inter-discipline interface points and how they are managed
   - **Geotechnical Review (1–2 paragraphs):** Identification of USG1123; confirmation of review; sufficiency determination with basis; design assumptions to be carried forward; USG1123 program limitation addressed; risk management for field conditions; explicit no-additional-investigation statement
   - **Specialty Consultants (1 paragraph):** Named specialties or engagement approach as applicable
2. Incorporate findings from Steps A, B, and C directly.
3. Ensure language:
   - Is direct and specific to this project (avoid generic boilerplate)
   - Explicitly attributes responsibility to the Design-Builder (not just consultants)
   - Aligns with DEC-013 (no additional investigation — stated plainly)
   - References USG1123 by file number, date, and firm (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., USG1123, February 2021)
   - States design assumptions from USG1123 (frost depth, groundwater, bearing capacities, sulphate class) in the geotechnical section
   - Addresses the USG1123 program limitation (§2.2) and the structural/civil consultant's applicability determination
   - Acknowledges inspection and certification obligations from RFP page 21 in the management section
   - Is consistent with DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-01-09, and DEL-01-08
4. Target length: 2–3 pages of body text (plus discipline table).

**Completion Check:** All six required elements present; RFP §7.3.4 fully addressed; DEC-013 alignment confirmed; USG1123 cited with specificity; RFP page 21 inspection obligation acknowledged; length within target.

---

### Step E: Cross-Document Consistency Check

**Owner:** Proposal Coordinator / QA Reviewer
**When:** Before peer review (Step F)

**Actions:**
1. Perform the following cross-document checks:

| Check | Documents Compared | Pass Criteria |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| Discipline names and roles | This narrative vs. DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) | All firms and roles match; no discrepancies |
| Key personnel | Named lead consultants vs. DEL-01-08 (Key Resumes) | All lead consultants designated "key personnel" have resumes on file |
| Team accountability | This narrative vs. DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) | No contradictions in DB accountability or H&S structure |
| Inspection obligations | This narrative vs. DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration) | Inspection and certification obligations consistent; monthly arch inspection matches |
| Geotechnical basis | This narrative vs. DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions) | Same USG1123 report (File No. USG1123, Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., Feb 2021) used as basis; sufficiency conclusions aligned |
| Foundation concept | This narrative vs. DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability) | Foundation type and bearing stratum consistent with USG1123 recommendations stated here |
| No additional investigation | This narrative vs. DEL-01-04/DEL-01-05 (Pricing) | No budget line for additional geotech investigation exists in pricing |
| Geotechnical monitoring classification (D-001) | This narrative (R-006 specialty consultant section) | If construction-phase geotechnical monitoring is proposed as a specialty service, it is explicitly classified as **construction quality control** (foundation bearing surface inspection per USG1123 §5.4 item 10) and **not** as additional geotechnical investigation. Language is consistent with DEC-013 scope constraint. No pricing for additional investigation exists. |
| Sulphate class | This narrative vs. DEL-05-01 / DEL-05-02 (Durability) | Sulphate Class S-2 and Type HS cement requirement from USG1123 §4.3 carried forward consistently |

2. Resolve any discrepancies identified:
   - If discipline assignment differs between this narrative and Appendix I, reconcile before proceeding.
   - If geotechnical sufficiency language differs from DEL-10-02, align to consistent phrasing.
   - If management structure contradicts DEL-07-01, update the less-developed document.
   - If sulphate class or foundation assumptions differ from DEL-05-01/DEL-05-02, reconcile with structural lead.

**Output:** Cross-check matrix with pass/fail status for each check; all discrepancies resolved.

**Completion Check:** All cross-document checks pass; no open discrepancies.

---

### Step F: Peer Review and Finalization

**Owner:** PM (reviewer); Construction Manager or Design Manager (second reviewer)
**When:** After Step E is complete

**Actions:**
1. PM reviews narrative for:
   - Accuracy of team assignments and experience statements
   - Clarity of management structure
   - Completeness of geotechnical review section (USG1123 cited by file no. and date; design assumptions listed; program limitation addressed)
   - Consistency with DEC-013
   - Alignment with overall proposal strategy
2. Structural or civil lead reviews geotechnical sufficiency section for technical accuracy (USG1123 values and assumptions correctly stated).
3. Incorporate all feedback.
4. Confirm formatting matches proposal template (font, heading style, page layout).
5. Obtain final sign-off: PM approval + structural or civil lead acknowledgement of geotechnical section accuracy.

**Output:** Signed-off final draft; formatting confirmed.

**Completion Check:** Sign-off received from PM and at least one discipline lead; no open review comments.
