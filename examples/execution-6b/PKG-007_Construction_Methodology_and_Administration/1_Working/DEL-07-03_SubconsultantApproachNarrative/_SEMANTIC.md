# Deliverable: DEL-07-03 Subconsultant Approach Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable governs the narrative demonstration that a design-build team possesses required discipline coverage, management accountability, interface coordination protocols, and geotechnical sufficiency basis to credibly organize and execute subconsultant-driven work across design and construction phases. It must carry knowledge about team structure, regulatory accountability, inspection obligations, and site condition reliance -- expressed as a persuasive proposal narrative rather than as technical specifications. The semantic lens conditions all categories toward the subconsultant coordination and accountability domain.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

- p1 = judgmental totality * purposeful directional scope = "comprehensive merit domain"
- p2 = judgmental totality * realized implementation scope = "exhaustive value coverage"
- p3 = judgmental totality * conclusive adjudicative domain = "total worth jurisdiction"
- p4 = judgmental totality * reappraised quality scope = "complete quality purview"

**Step 3:** Centroid of {comprehensive merit domain, exhaustive value coverage, total worth jurisdiction, complete quality purview} --> u = **"Total Worth Jurisdiction"**

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- t1 = Purposeful Merit Steering * Unified Directional Harmony = "purposeful directional unity"
- t2 = Settled Worth Realization * Harmonized Execution Integrity = "realized execution harmony"
- t3 = Definitive Worth Ruling * Confirmed Adjudicative Integrity = "conclusive adjudicative integrity"
- t4 = Settled Quality Reappraisal * Validated Reassessment Harmony = "reappraised quality harmony"

L = {purposeful directional unity, realized execution harmony, conclusive adjudicative integrity, reappraised quality harmony}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * consistency = "judgmental coherence"

**Step 2:**
- p1 = judgmental coherence * purposeful directional unity = "unified merit direction"
- p2 = judgmental coherence * realized execution harmony = "harmonized value alignment"
- p3 = judgmental coherence * conclusive adjudicative integrity = "definitive worth integrity"
- p4 = judgmental coherence * reappraised quality harmony = "confirmed quality coherence"

**Step 3:** Centroid of {unified merit direction, harmonized value alignment, definitive worth integrity, confirmed quality coherence} --> u = **"Definitive Worth Coherence"**
