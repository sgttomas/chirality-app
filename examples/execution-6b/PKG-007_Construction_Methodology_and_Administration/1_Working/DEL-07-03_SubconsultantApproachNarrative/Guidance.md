# Guidance: Subconsultant Approach Narrative

## Purpose

This deliverable serves two distinct but complementary evaluation functions under the RFP scoring framework:

**1. Construction Methodology Sub-criterion (OBJ-002 — 3 pts of 10 pts Project Delivery Plan)**
The Subconsultant Approach Narrative is part of the Construction Methodology section (RFP 7.2–7.3). It demonstrates that the Design-Builder has organized a capable, discipline-complete team and established clear protocols for subconsultant management through both design and construction phases. Evaluators use this to assess organizational readiness and credibility of the delivery approach.

**2. Project Team and Firms Sub-criterion (OBJ-006 — 15 pts)**
By naming and briefly describing the qualifications of required discipline consultants, the narrative contributes evidence of team strength. The formal Appendix I (DEL-01-09) and Key Resumes (DEL-01-08) carry the bulk of the OBJ-006 score, but this narrative provides the narrative context that makes Appendix I legible — showing not just who the team is, but how they will function together.

A well-written subconsultant narrative converts a compliance checklist (disciplines confirmed) into a credibility signal (team is ready, organized, and has relevant experience).

---

## Principles

### P-001: Discipline Completeness Is Non-Negotiable
All six discipline categories named in RFP §7.3.4 must be covered without gaps. Any omission signals a compliance risk to evaluators and may reduce the Construction Methodology score.

Why it matters: RFP §7.3.4 uses the phrase "shall carry additional subconsultants as deemed necessary to complete the Work to meet all code, acts and regulatory requirements." An incomplete discipline list implies the Design-Builder has not fully accounted for its own obligations.

---

### P-002: Accountability Must Be Unambiguous
The narrative must clearly assign ultimate responsibility for design quality, regulatory compliance, and subconsultant coordination to the Design-Builder (not to individual consultants). This mirrors the CCDC 14 Design-Build model where the Design-Builder is the single point of accountability.

Why it matters: Evaluators are assessing whether the Design-Builder understands its obligations, not just its team roster. The RFP explicitly states the Design-Builder "shall carry" subconsultants and is responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance. The inspection obligations on RFP page 21 reinforce that the DB is responsible for ensuring its consultants perform — monthly for the architect, per schedule for other disciplines.

---

### P-003: Geotechnical Scope Must Be Explicitly Closed — With Evidence
DEC-013 (OI-004 closed) establishes that no additional geotechnical investigation will be proposed or priced. The narrative must make this position explicit, credible, and backed by a sufficiency determination from qualified consultants (structural or civil lead). A vague or silent treatment of the geotechnical question leaves the evaluator uncertain.

Why it matters: RFP §7.3.4 requires the Design-Builder to state explicitly whether additional investigation is required. OSR §10.3.2 further states the Design-Builder bears the cost if additional investigation is needed. Silence on this point is a non-response. A clear determination — identifying the specific report (USG1123, February 2021, 18 boreholes), naming which consultants reviewed it, and listing the design assumptions to be carried forward — converts a potential risk into a demonstration of thoroughness.

**The specific report to reference:** Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File No. USG1123, dated February 12, 2021, prepared for Tagish Engineering Ltd. The report provides: soil stratigraphy (topsoil / sand / clay / till), bearing capacity values for both sand and till bearing strata, frost penetration depth (2.0 m), groundwater depth (3.0–4.0 m), sulphate class (S-2), and three foundation system options (shallow foundations, driven steel pipe piles, screw piles).

---

### P-004: Experience Alignment Strengthens OBJ-006
Where possible, briefly connect each discipline consultant's assignment to relevant prior experience on similar municipal facilities (fire halls, public works operations centres, multi-use municipal buildings). This ties the narrative to the team qualifications evaluation and avoids the section reading as a generic team roster.

Why it matters: The scoring matrix (RFP 8.3, page 27) awards the highest scores to responses that "exceed expectations and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements that provides certainty of success." Relevant experience narratives transform a list into a capability demonstration.

**Guidance on judging "relevant experience" sufficiency (C-002):** The documents prescribe experience alignment but do not define a minimum threshold. The following factors should guide assessment of whether a consultant's experience is sufficient for this deliverable -- **ASSUMPTION (no RFP-mandated threshold exists; these are best-practice heuristics):**
- **Comparable facility type:** At least one prior project involving a fire hall, public works operations centre, or multi-use municipal building. Projects involving other emergency services facilities (ambulance stations, police facilities) or industrial shop buildings are directionally relevant but less directly comparable.
- **Recency:** Projects completed or substantially advanced within the last 10 years are preferred. Older experience may be cited but should be supplemented with more recent work.
- **Scale:** Projects of comparable building area and complexity (combined facility ~2,775 m² or comparable). Significantly smaller or simpler projects are less persuasive.
- **Geographic relevance:** Alberta experience is preferred (familiarity with ABC, APEGA requirements, local soil/climate conditions). Western Canadian experience is acceptable; experience in other Canadian provinces is relevant but less directly transferable for regulatory alignment.
- **Role relevance:** The firm's role on the prior project should be comparable to the role proposed here (e.g., a firm proposed as structural engineer of record should have served as structural EOR, not as a subconsultant to another structural firm, on comparable projects).

These factors are not pass/fail gates but rather a framework for the team to self-assess credential strength before drafting the narrative. If a discipline consultant cannot demonstrate at least one comparable project, the narrative should address how the firm's broader experience compensates.

---

### P-005: Coordination Structure Supports Delivery Confidence
A described coordination structure (meeting cadence, approval authority, interface points, escalation path) shows the evaluator that the Design-Builder has thought through how the team will function, not just who is on it. This directly supports the "Construction Methodology" scoring under OBJ-002.

---

### P-006: Address the USG1123 Program Limitation Proactively
The 2021 geotechnical report was prepared for a slightly different program (1,875 m² shop/office building + 900 m² fire hall), and the report itself notes that "if there are any changes to the proposed developments, or their locations, these changes should be reviewed by Union Street personnel to confirm the applicability of this report" (USG1123 §2.2). The Design-Builder should address this proactively — either stating that the current program is materially consistent with the 2021 concept (and therefore USG1123 is applicable), or noting that the structural/civil consultant will confirm applicability before foundation design commences.

Why it matters: This demonstrates that the team has actually read the report, not just cited it. An evaluator familiar with geotechnical practice will recognize this limitation and will award higher confidence scores to a proponent that addresses it directly.

## Considerations

### C-001: Organizational Structure Options

**Option A — Discipline Hierarchy Table (recommended for clarity)**

| Role | Firm | Lead Individual | Primary Responsibility |
|------|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Design-Builder (PM/CM) | [DB Firm] | [Name] | Overall accountability, Owner interface |
| Architectural | [Firm A] | [Name] | Design lead, code compliance, construction admin, monthly inspections |
| Civil Engineering | [Firm B] | [Name] | Site, grading, utilities, drainage; USG1123 applicability review |
| Structural Engineering | [Firm C] | [Name] | Foundation design (USG1123-based), framing, slab |
| Mechanical Engineering | [Firm D] | [Name] | HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, apparatus exhaust, fill stations, generator |
| Electrical Engineering | [Firm E] | [Name] | Power, lighting, controls, IT/data, solar-ready provisions |
| Specialty — [type TBD] | [Firm F] | [Name] | [scope TBD] |

Advantage: Clear, compact, easy for evaluators to verify discipline coverage at a glance.
Disadvantage: May appear mechanical; should be accompanied by brief narrative on management approach.

**Option B — Phase-Structured Description**

Describe the team in two layers: Design Phase (design lead, discipline supporting roles, review and approval process) and Construction Phase (CM lead, inspector roles, certification obligations per RFP page 21). This shows how the same team transforms its function across project phases.

Advantage: Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Design-Build delivery lifecycle; directly addresses RFP page 21 inspection obligation.
Disadvantage: More complex to write; risk of losing discipline clarity if not well organized.

**Option C — Integrated Matrix with Named Interfaces**

Identify cross-discipline responsibilities explicitly: "Structural consultant responsible for foundation design in coordination with Civil consultant on site grading and geotechnical report applicability; interface managed through bi-weekly design coordination meetings chaired by Architectural lead."

Advantage: Strongest signal of team integration and OBJ-002 support.
Disadvantage: Requires firm team assembly before drafting; cannot be written with TBD firm names.

---

### C-002: Geotechnical Review Protocol — Detail Levels

Three levels of detail are available for the geotechnical sufficiency section:

**Level 1 — Assertion only (weakest):**
"The existing 2021 geotechnical report (Appendix D) has been reviewed and is deemed sufficient for design purposes. No additional investigation is required."

**Level 2 — Basis provided (recommended minimum):**
"The 2021 geotechnical investigation report (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File No. USG1123, February 2021 — Appendix D) was reviewed by our structural and civil consultants against the proposed building footprint, site development plan, and foundation concept. The report covers 18 boreholes across the site (BH101–BH118), provides bearing capacity values for both sand and till bearing strata, documents groundwater conditions (3.0–4.0 m below grade), establishes frost penetration depth (2.0 m), identifies sulphate exposure class (S-2), and presents three viable foundation system options for this site. The report is deemed sufficient for design-stage foundation analysis. No additional investigation is required or priced."

**Level 3 — Full protocol (strongest, most credible):**
Adds: which specific consultants reviewed the report; which design assumptions will be carried forward (frost depth 2.0 m, groundwater 3.0–4.0 m, bearing capacity values per USG1123 §5.4); how the USG1123 program limitation (§2.2 — prepared for a slightly different facility concept) is addressed (structural/civil consultant confirmation of applicability); what risk management applies if field conditions differ during construction (e.g., re-engage Union Street Geotechnical Ltd. for foundation bearing surface inspection per USG1123 §5.4 item 10); and explicit confirmation that no budget or schedule allowance exists for additional investigation.

**Recommendation:** Level 3 is most credible and directly addresses both the RFP §7.3.4 obligation, the OSR §10.3.2 risk clause, and the report's own limitation caveat (USG1123 §2.2). It also aligns with Principle P-003 and P-006.

---

### C-003: Specialty Consultant Strategy

The RFP names "Specialty consultants as required" without definition. Options:

**Option 1 — Name specific specialties:**
Example: "We will engage a code consulting firm for Alberta Building Code plan review support. We are also establishing a geotechnical construction monitoring protocol using Union Street Geotechnical Ltd. (original investigation firm) for foundation bearing surface inspections prior to footing casting, as recommended in the 2021 report. This is a construction quality measure — not additional investigation — and is consistent with DEC-013."
Advantage: More concrete; stronger credibility; demonstrates report has been read thoroughly.

**Option 2 — Define engagement approach:**
Example: "Specialty consultants will be identified as design advances beyond concept stage. Candidates include code consulting (Alberta Building Code plan review), acoustic consulting (apparatus bay noise management), and fire protection engineering (if required beyond mechanical consultant's scope)."
Advantage: Preserves flexibility; appropriate if team is not yet fully assembled.

---

### C-004: Cross-Document Consistency Requirements

| Cross-Document Check | What Must Align |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) | Every firm named here must appear in Appendix I with the same discipline and role assignment |
| DEL-01-08 (Key Resumes) | Any lead consultant designated as "key personnel" must have a resume in DEL-01-08 |
| DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) | Team accountability structure and H&S responsibilities must not contradict this narrative |
| DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration) | Inspection obligations and document management roles must be consistent |
| DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions) | Geotechnical sufficiency determination must reference the same 2021 report (USG1123) as described in DEL-10-02; sufficiency conclusions must align |
| DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability) | Foundation concept (pile type, depth, bearing stratum) should be consistent with USG1123 recommendations cited here |

### C-005: Contingency for USG1123 Non-Applicability Determination (X-002)

All four documents currently assume the structural/civil consultant's sufficiency determination will be positive (aligned with DEC-013). However, DEC-013 is a **project decision** (no additional investigation at this time), not a **technical finding** (the report is sufficient). If the structural/civil consultant determines that USG1123 is **not applicable** to the current building program per the report's own limitation clause (§2.2), the following contingency path applies:

**Trigger:** Structural or civil lead consultant formally determines that one or more of the following conditions exist:
- The current building footprint falls outside the area covered by USG1123's 18 boreholes (BH101-BH118)
- The current structural loads exceed the bearing capacity values provided for the investigated strata
- The building program differs materially from the 2021 concept (1,875 m² shop/office + 900 m² fire hall) in a way that affects foundation design assumptions

**Escalation protocol:**
1. Consultant escalates to PM immediately (per Procedure Step B item 4) with a written technical memo explaining the basis for non-applicability
2. PM convenes a scope decision review within **48 hours** of receiving the technical memo -- **ASSUMPTION: timeframe is best practice, not RFP-mandated**
3. The scope decision review must address:
   - Whether DEC-013 should be **revised** to permit additional geotechnical investigation (with associated cost and schedule implications)
   - Whether the non-applicability finding can be **mitigated** (e.g., by adjusting building footprint to align with investigated area, or by using conservative design assumptions from the existing data)
   - What the **proposal impact** would be: if additional investigation is needed, it must be "clearly stated and costed accordingly" per RFP §7.3.4 -- this directly contradicts the current DEC-013 position
4. Decision authority for revising DEC-013 rests with the project principal (not the PM alone), as it affects both pricing and technical risk position

**Impact on the narrative:** If this contingency is triggered before narrative finalization, the Subconsultant Approach Narrative must be revised to reflect the updated scope position. If triggered after proposal submission, it becomes a post-award design development issue.

**Note:** This contingency is provided for completeness. Per DEC-013, the expected outcome is a positive sufficiency determination. The contingency protocol ensures the team is not caught without a decision path if the technical finding diverges from the project decision.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Narrative Depth vs. Page Budget

The proposal is a single PDF under 15 MB (C-01). Every page of narrative consumes page budget.

- A deeper narrative (3–4 pages) strengthens OBJ-006 by providing more experience evidence and geotechnical detail, but competes with page budget across other sections.
- A concise narrative (1–2 pages) with a discipline table and brief geotech statement is efficient but may score lower on the "team demonstration" component.

**Recommendation:** Target 2–3 pages. Use a table for discipline list (dense, easy to scan), narrative paragraphs for management structure and geotech protocol (2–3 paragraphs each), and brief experience callouts (1–2 sentences per discipline).

**Scoring weight allocation guidance (F-002):** This narrative serves two scoring functions with materially different point values: Construction Methodology (OBJ-002, 3 pts of 10 pts Project Delivery Plan) and Team Qualifications (OBJ-006, 15 pts). The team qualifications dimension carries **5x the point value** of the construction methodology sub-score. Within a constrained page budget, narrative emphasis should reflect this weighting:
- **Team credentials and experience content** (supporting OBJ-006 at 15 pts) should receive the majority of narrative depth -- named firms, specific comparable project references, role-relevant experience statements, and the discipline table with credential detail.
- **Management structure and coordination content** (supporting OBJ-002 at 3 pts) should be clear and complete but more concise -- organizational chart or table, brief coordination protocol description, and escalation path.
- **Geotechnical sufficiency content** serves both dimensions (demonstrates technical competence under OBJ-006 and delivery readiness under OBJ-002) and should be treated as a high-value differentiator deserving proportionate attention.

**ASSUMPTION:** The RFP does not explicitly state how subconsultant narrative content maps to scoring sub-criteria. This allocation guidance is inferred from point values and evaluation category descriptions (RFP 8.3, page 27). The team should validate this weighting assumption against their understanding of the evaluation committee's priorities.

---

### T-002: Specificity vs. Team Assembly Status

Writing a strong narrative requires named firms and specific credentials. If team assembly is not complete, the narrative will contain TBD placeholders that weaken the response.

- If team is assembled: Name firms, describe relevant experience, produce Option C organizational structure.
- If team is partially assembled: Name confirmed firms, use "TBD — to be confirmed prior to submission" for unconfirmed positions, and ensure Appendix I is consistent.
- If team is not assembled: Describe the engagement approach and criteria for consultant selection; note that specific firms will be listed in Appendix I. **This is the weakest approach and should be avoided if possible.**

---

### T-003: Geotech Detail vs. Risk Exposure

Providing a detailed geotechnical sufficiency determination (Level 3 per C-002) is stronger for evaluation but creates a commitment: if field conditions during construction reveal the existing report was insufficient, the Design-Builder has asserted in its proposal that it accepted this risk. DEC-013 already resolves this at a project level — the risk is already accepted — so the narrative should reflect DEC-013 faithfully, not minimize or contradict it.

The USG1123 report itself acknowledges conditions may vary between boreholes (18 boreholes across ~10 ha site). The report's own §5 notes that foundation inspections by a qualified geotechnical engineer are required prior to footing casting. Naming a construction-phase geotechnical monitoring service (Option 1 in C-003) partially manages residual risk while staying within DEC-013's "no additional investigation" constraint.

## Examples

### Example EX-001: Discipline Confirmation Paragraph (with experience context)

> "The Design-Builder's consultant team covers all required disciplines as identified in RFP Section 7.3.4. [Firm A], our architectural lead, brings [N] years of municipal facility design experience including [relevant comparable project — TBD]. [Firm B], the structural engineer of record, has delivered foundation design on [N] comparable municipal facilities in central Alberta and will lead the USG1123 geotechnical report applicability review. [Firm C] (Civil), [Firm D] (Mechanical), and [Firm E] (Electrical) each bring demonstrated municipal facility project experience aligned to the operational requirements of this combined Fire Hall and Public Works facility."
>
> *(Note: Firm names, project counts, and project references are TBD — to be completed when team assembly is confirmed.)*

---

### Example EX-002: Management Structure Paragraph (medium detail)

> "The Design-Builder retains overall responsibility for design quality, regulatory compliance, and subconsultant coordination. During the design phase, the Architectural lead chairs bi-weekly multi-discipline design coordination meetings. Each discipline lead submits monthly design progress reports to the PM; the PM escalates any coordination conflicts to the Design-Builder principal within 24 hours of identification. During the construction phase, the Construction Manager coordinates daily site activities with each discipline's inspection personnel. At each progress draw, discipline consultants submit written field inspection reports to the CM — the Architect at minimum performs monthly site inspections and provides written reports, while other discipline inspectors perform inspections per the approved project schedule and at all critical milestones, as required by the RFP (page 21). At substantial performance, each discipline consultant performs a site visit and issues a letter certifying general conformance with the Construction Documents."

*(Source: RFP page 21 — inspection and certification obligation cited directly.)*

---

### Example EX-003: Geotechnical Sufficiency Statement (Level 2 — recommended minimum, with USG1123 specifics)

> "The Design-Builder's structural and civil consultants have reviewed the 2021 geotechnical investigation report provided in Appendix D (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File No. USG1123, February 12, 2021; 18 boreholes BH101–BH118), along with the topographic and site information in Appendix E-F. The report characterizes subsurface conditions across the site: stratigraphy consists of topsoil overlying sand (~1.35 m average depth), clay, and till, with groundwater measured at approximately 3.0 m to 4.0 m below grade. Frost penetration depth is established at 2.0 m based on historical data for the Penhold region. Bearing capacity values are established for both sand and till bearing strata, and three viable foundation system options are documented (shallow foundations on sand or till, driven steel pipe piles, screw piles). The report also identifies sulphate exposure Class S-2, requiring Type HS cement with minimum 32 MPa 56-day compressive strength and maximum water-cement ratio of 0.45 — this requirement is carried forward into the structural and civil design specifications.
>
> On the basis of this review, the Design-Builder confirms that the existing report is sufficient to support design-stage analysis of foundations, site grading, and civil works. **No additional geotechnical investigation is proposed or priced in this proposal.** Design assumptions to be relied upon for foundation design (including frost depth, groundwater levels, bearing capacity values, and sulphate class) are documented in the Structural Design Brief (DEL-03-03) and will be formally confirmed at the start of detailed design by the structural and civil engineering leads."

*(Note: Specific bearing capacity values and pile design assumptions are documented in USG1123 §5.2–§5.5; to be confirmed as applicable to the current building program by structural/civil consultant at design commencement.)*

---

### Example EX-004: Geotechnical Monitoring Note (specialty consultant framing — Level 3 addition)

> "As a construction-phase quality measure, the Design-Builder will engage Union Street Geotechnical Ltd. (the original investigation firm) to inspect all shallow foundation bearing surfaces prior to casting footings, per the recommendation in USG1123 §5.4 (item 10). This is a field verification service within the existing report's framework — not additional investigation — and is consistent with the project scope decision not to conduct additional pre-design geotechnical work. This service is priced within the construction administration allowance and does not represent a separate investigation cost."

*(Source: USG1123 §5.4 item 10 — "A qualified geotechnical engineer must inspect all shallow foundation bearing surfaces prior to casting footings.")*

---

### Examples — Not Provided (TBD Pending Team Assembly)

- Specific consultant firm names and credentials
- Named specialty consultants and their scopes (beyond geotechnical monitoring)
- Specific prior project references per discipline
- Detailed coordination meeting schedules (depend on design phase start date)
- Foundation type selection (shallow vs. pile — depends on structural loads not yet defined; USG1123 provides all three options)
