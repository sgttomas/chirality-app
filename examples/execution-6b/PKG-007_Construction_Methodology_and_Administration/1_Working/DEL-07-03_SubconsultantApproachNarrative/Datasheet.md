## Conditions

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| **Required Disciplines** | Architectural, Civil Engineering, Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Specialty consultants as required (RFP §7.3.4, page 22 — verbatim: "i.e. Architectural, Civil Engineering, Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Specialty consultants as required") |
| **Design-Builder Accountability** | "The Design-Builder shall carry additional subconsultants as deemed necessary to complete the Work to meet all code, acts and regulatory requirements, or to satisfy innovative components of the Design-Builder's proposed methodology" (RFP §7.3.4, page 22 — verbatim) |
| **Geotechnical Review Obligation** | "The Design-Builder is responsible for reviewing the site-specific geotechnical investigation report and topographic information (see Appendix D-F) to determine if this is sufficient information to complete their design. If additional investigation work is required, this is to be clearly stated and costed accordingly in their proposal." (RFP §7.3.4, page 22 — verbatim) |
| **OSR Geotechnical Clause** | "A Geotechnical Investigation was completed for the site and the report can be found in Appendix D. If the proponent finds the report to be insufficient to effectively design and construct the facilities, then the Design-Builder will be required to undertake and pay for additional geotechnical investigation as required." (OSR §10.3.2, page 39 — verbatim) |
| **DEC-013 Scope Constraint** | No additional geotechnical investigation at this time. Foundation design and site assessment will rely on existing 2021 report (USG1123) only. No pricing allowance for future investigation. (Decomposition §12, OI-004 closed) |
| **Appendix I Alignment** | Discipline assignments in this narrative must be consistent with completed Appendix I (DEL-01-09) — firm names, roles, and key personnel must match exactly |
| **Inspection Obligations** | "The Architect, at a minimum, is expected to perform monthly inspections, while other disciplines of the Design-Builder's team are expected to perform inspections as per the approved project schedule and at all critical milestones. At substantial performance, each discipline of the Design-Builder's consultant team shall perform a site visit and issue letter certifying the construction is in general conformance with the Construction Documents." (RFP page 21 — verbatim) |
| **Meeting Protocol Post-Award** | After contract award, Design-Builder chairs Design/Construction progress meetings with Project Committee; issues agenda 3 business days before meeting; issues minutes within 4 business days; provides monthly progress reports; issues updated project schedule with each agenda. (RFP §7.3.5, page 22) |

## Construction

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Content Structure** | Narrative section covering: (1) required disciplines confirmed and named; (2) Design-Builder accountability statement for compliance and coordination; (3) team management and reporting structure (design phase + construction phase); (4) interface coordination protocols between disciplines; (5) geotechnical and topographic information review and sufficiency determination per DEC-013; (6) specialty consultant identification or engagement approach |
| **Geotechnical Report Key Facts** | USG1123 (Feb 2021): 18 boreholes (BH101–BH118), depths 3.05 m to 12.65 m; stratigraphy = topsoil / sand (~1.35 m avg) / clay (~1.35–3.17 m avg) / till (to max depth BH101–BH108); groundwater 3.0–4.0 m below grade (avg 4.14 m, measured Feb 3, 2021); frost penetration depth = 2.0 m; sulphate class S-2 design recommended; clay = CH (high plasticity) — NOT a suitable shallow foundation bearing stratum |
| **Foundation Design Values (from USG1123)** | Shallow foundations on sand (>0.61 m): ULS 300 kPa, SLS 100 kPa (settlement < 25 mm); shallow foundations on till (>2.0 m): ULS 360 kPa, SLS 120 kPa; frost jacking adfreezing stress = 100 kPa above 2.0 m depth; minimum pile embedment for unheated structures = 5.3 m (§5.5.2 USG1123); screw pile upper helix must be below 2.0 m frost depth (§5.3 USG1123) |
| **Geotechnical Report Limitation** | "If there are any changes to the proposed developments, or their locations, these changes should be reviewed by Union Street personnel to confirm the applicability of this report to the revised development plans." (USG1123 §2.2) — This limitation is relevant because the 2021 report was prepared for an earlier program concept; the Design-Builder's structural/civil consultants must confirm applicability to the current building program |
| **Source Authority** | RFP Section 7.3.4 (primary); OSR §10.3.2 (supporting); DEC-013 (geotechnical scope constraint); USG1123 (geotechnical data source); Decomposition SOW-0021 |
| **Cross-References** | DEL-01-09 (Appendix I — subtrade/consultant list alignment); DEL-01-08 (Key Team Members — lead consultant resumes); DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence — geotech review protocol alignment); DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology — team accountability context); DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration — document management alignment); DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability — foundation concept alignment) |
| **Anticipated Artifact** | Subconsultant approach narrative section (as submitted in proposal PDF) |
| **Format** | Proposal narrative prose; no specific format constraints stated in RFP §7.3.4; organizational chart or discipline table recommended for clarity |
| **Estimated Length** | TBD — typically 2–4 pages; no RFP page limit specified for this section |
