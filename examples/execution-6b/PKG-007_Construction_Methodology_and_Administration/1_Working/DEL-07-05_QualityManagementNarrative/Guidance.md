# Guidance — DEL-07-05: Quality Management Narrative

## Purpose

The Quality Management Narrative demonstrates the Proponent's commitment to systematic quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) across all phases of the Public Services Building design-build project. It contributes to proposal scoring and to the Owner's confidence that the facility will be delivered to the required standard.

**Why this document matters:**
1. **Evaluation scoring (OBJ-002):** Quality management is integrated within the Construction Methodology score (3 pts of a 10-pt Project Delivery Plan). A credible, detailed QM approach signals delivery competence. (Source: RFP §8.3, p. 26)
2. **Risk mitigation (OBJ-008):** Proactive QC reduces construction rework, schedule delay, and cost overrun — directly supporting transparent risk management.
3. **Regulatory compliance:** RFP §7.2 (p. 19) explicitly assigns conformity to all AHJ requirements as the Design-Builder's responsibility. The QM narrative must credibly demonstrate how this will be achieved.
4. **Owner's long-term interest:** The main building is intended to serve the community for 50 years (RFP §2.2, p. 8). Quality controls must be proportionate to that design life.
5. **Financial protection:** The Owner holds 2.5x the calculated deficiency value until deficiencies are corrected (RFP §7.3.7, p. 23). Strong QC upstream reduces deficiency holdback exposure.

## Vocabulary Note — QA, QC, and QM Terminology

The following terms are used throughout the four DEL-07-05 documents. Consistent usage reduces ambiguity when the narrative is drafted. (Source: Lensing item B-003; terminology observed across Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure)

| Term | Definition as Used | Usage Context |
|---|---|---|
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | The systematic, planned activities that provide confidence that the project will satisfy quality requirements. QA is proactive and process-oriented — it defines the framework (checklists, standards, review gates) before work begins. | Design QC gates, documentation standards, PE certification framework |
| **Quality Control (QC)** | The operational techniques and activities used to verify that quality requirements are being met during and after execution. QC is reactive and product-oriented — it inspects, tests, and verifies actual work. | Site inspections, concrete cylinder tests, air barrier tests, MEP functional tests, shop drawing review |
| **Quality Management (QM)** | The overarching discipline encompassing both QA and QC. This is the term used for the deliverable title ("Quality Management Narrative") because the narrative addresses both the proactive framework and the reactive controls. | Document title; overall narrative scope |
| **QA/QC** | Compound shorthand used in the RFP (§7.2, p. 20: "Quality Management (QA/QC and Documentation)") and in these documents when referring to the combined framework. When precision is needed, use QA or QC individually. | RFP-aligned references; general framework discussions |

| **OSR** | Owner's Statement of Requirements — the document defining the Owner's functional, performance, and quality expectations for the facility. Referenced in the RFP as the benchmark against which shop drawings, submittals, and deficiency corrections are evaluated (e.g., "compliance with the intent of the original design as per the OSR" — RFP §7.3, p. 20). | Shop drawing review (R-QM-05), deficiency correction (R-QM-09), design intent verification |

**Guidance:** When drafting the proposal narrative, prefer "Quality Management" for the overall approach and use "QA" and "QC" distinctly when describing specific activities. Avoid using "QA/QC" as a vague catch-all when one term is more precise. Define "OSR" on first use in the narrative as "Owner's Statement of Requirements" since it is not a universally recognized abbreviation. (Source: Lensing item X-003)

## Principles

### P-001: Compliance with Best Practice and Codes is the Baseline

The RFP §7.2 (p. 20) sets a clear baseline: work must be completed to "current industry standards, good construction Best Practice, all applicable and referenced codes, regulations, standards, trade associations, and local by-laws" and "in accordance with original manufacturer's instructions and recommendations, by accordingly qualified and/or licensed trade professionals to the best possible standards and practices."

This is not a discretionary commitment — it is the RFP's minimum standard. The Quality Management Narrative must show how this baseline is operationalized, not just asserted.

**Application:** State this standard explicitly in the proposal narrative. Then describe the inspection, certification, and documentation mechanisms that verify it is being met.

---

### P-002: Design QC Reduces Downstream Risk

Design-phase quality control — discipline reviews, cross-discipline coordination checks, and PE certifications — catches non-conformances before construction begins. Rework during construction is significantly more expensive than design revision.

**Application:** Align design QC gates to the five RFP §7.1.8 submission milestones: Building Design Development, 60% Detailed Design, Foundation IFC (if needed), 100% Building Detailed Design, 100% IFC Package. At each gate, require discipline lead sign-off and cross-discipline coordination confirmation before submitting to Owner.

**Supporting Source:** RFP §7.1.8, p. 18; RFP §7.2, p. 20.

---

### P-003: Construction Inspection Frequency Must Be Proportionate and Committed

The RFP §7.3 (p. 21) specifies that the Architect inspects a minimum monthly and all other disciplines inspect "per the approved project schedule and at all critical milestones" — with written reports along with each progress draw. These are not suggestions; they are contractual obligations.

**Application:** State the Architect's monthly-minimum commitment explicitly. For other disciplines, commit to inspecting at all critical milestones (foundation, structural frame, envelope closure, MEP rough-in, MEP final, final assembly) plus per-schedule frequency TBD post-award. This is transparent and honest at proposal stage.

**Supporting Source:** RFP §7.3, p. 21.

---

### P-004: Substantial Performance Certification is a Formal Multi-Discipline Event

At substantial performance, every discipline of the Design-Builder's consultant team must visit the site and issue a letter certifying the construction is in general conformance with the Construction Documents (RFP §7.3, p. 21). This is not a single general inspection — it is a per-discipline formal certification.

**Application:** Identify this in the narrative as a formal, structured milestone. List the disciplines required: architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical. Describe the certification letter format and the relationship between this certification and the five closeout documents required for Substantial Performance (RFP §7.5, p. 24: Occupancy Permit, Final commissioning documents, All O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, Legal Survey).

---

### P-005: Documentation Standards Must Be Agreed — Not Assumed

The RFP §7.2 (p. 20) requires document numbering and formatting to "a standard to be established and agreed to by the Owner and the Project Manager." NMS format is recommended, not mandated. The Design-Builder must commit to establishing and agreeing this standard — not unilaterally impose a format.

**Application:** In the proposal, recommend NMS format and state willingness to agree a final numbering/formatting standard with the Owner and Project Manager within the post-award baseline schedule period (20 calendar days per RFP §7.2, Schedule Control provision). This respects the Owner's right to agree the standard.

**Supporting Source:** RFP §7.2, p. 20.

---

### P-006: Professional Sealing is Non-Negotiable

The RFP §7.2 (p. 20) requires a professional Architect or Engineer registered to practice in Alberta to seal "all planning, design, and construction documents, including reports and change documents requiring professional design services." This applies throughout the project, not just at final submission.

**Application:** Confirm in the narrative that all applicable documents will be sealed by Alberta-registered professionals. This covers design drawings, specifications, structural calculations, mechanical designs, electrical designs, civil drawings, and change documents. Connect to the subconsultant team described in DEL-07-03.

---

### P-007: Deficiency QC is the Downstream Consequence of Construction QC

The formal deficiency process (RFP §7.3.7, p. 23) — punch lists, monetary valuation, Owner 2.5x holdback, 12-month warranty review — is the financial and contractual consequence of construction quality performance. Strong construction QC reduces the number and severity of deficiencies, reduces holdback exposure, and shortens the deficiency closeout period.

**Application:** In the QM narrative, position deficiency management as a quality control outcome, not an isolated administrative process. State that effective design QC and construction QC are the primary tools for limiting deficiencies. Note that a comprehensive deficiency list incorporating both Design-Builder and Owner items will be maintained as a single list per RFP §7.3.7.

**Supporting Source:** RFP §7.3.7, p. 23.

---

## Considerations

### C-001: Combined-Facility Complexity Amplifies QC Requirements

The Public Services Building combines Fire Hall operations, Public Works Operations, and Cold Storage in one project. Each occupancy has distinct technical systems: fire apparatus bay exhaust ventilation, bay sumps, 16 ft overhead doors, water fill stations (2" minimum, one in each bay), backup generator, bunker gear locker ventilation, and solar-capable roofing. (Source: Addendum 03, §§1.8–1.17; RFP §7.2)

Quality control must be organized by system as well as by phase. Checklist items for a standard office building are not adequate for a combined public safety facility.

---

### C-002: AHJ Permits and Contractor QC Are Distinct — Both Are Required

The Design-Builder is responsible for all permits, inspections, and approvals, including all directed re-work and subsequent inspection costs (RFP §7.2, p. 19). AHJ building inspections (foundation, framing, mechanical, electrical, final occupancy) are regulatory events, separate from the Contractor's internal QC programme. Both are required, and the QM narrative should distinguish them.

Failure to coordinate AHJ inspection timing with construction sequence can cause costly delays. Building AHJ inspection checkpoints into the QC schedule prevents this.

---

### C-003: Written Reports With Each Progress Draw

RFP §7.3 (p. 21) ties written inspection reports to progress draws. This creates a financial incentive structure: the Design-Builder needs reports in order to claim payment. Communicating this link in the narrative demonstrates understanding of the contractual mechanism. The Payment Certifier will retain sufficient funds from progress draws to cover the completion of unfinished and deficient work (RFP §7.3.7, p. 23).

---

### C-004: Commissioning QC Is a Transition — Not a Phase

Commissioning is not a separate quality phase; it is the verification step that construction quality is adequate for system operation. The QM narrative should position commissioning QC as the handoff from construction QC to owner-accepted operations, coordinated with DEL-08-01. The deficiency list arising from commissioning is a QC artefact requiring corrective action through the same process as construction deficiencies.

---

### C-004a: QC Differentiation for 50-Year vs. 20-Year Design Life

The main combined facility (Fire Hall + Public Works Operations) carries a 50-year design life target (RFP §2.2, p. 8; OBJ-005). The Cold Storage building is an unheated, detached 60' x 100' structure with a 20-year design life (Decomposition §6, OBJ-005). QC controls should be proportionate to these distinct design life targets. (Source: Datasheet Conditions table; Lensing items F-003 and E-002)

**Main Building (50-year):**
- Higher inspection intensity at critical structural milestones (foundation, apparatus bay slabs with sumps, structural frame connections)
- Enhanced material verification: concrete mix design verified for durability and freeze-thaw resistance with long-term performance data; reinforcing corrosion protection verified; envelope air sealing verified with quantitative testing
- Full documentation depth: all inspection reports, test results, and certifications archived for design-life traceability
- System-specific QC for critical apparatus equipment (exhaust systems, generator, fire suppression) with commissioning verification

**Cold Storage (20-year):**
- Inspection focus on structural adequacy for unheated conditions: freeze-thaw cycling effects on foundation and slab, snow/wind load structural connections, envelope weathertightness (not thermal performance since unheated)
- Material verification focused on environmental exposure: corrosion-resistant fasteners, UV-resistant cladding, concrete freeze-thaw durability appropriate to unheated exposure conditions
- Reduced documentation scope relative to main building: standard construction records without the extended commissioning documentation required for mechanical/electrical systems (Cold Storage has minimal MEP)
- QC hold points focused on concealed structural connections and foundation elements, rather than MEP rough-in

**Application:** The QM narrative should explicitly acknowledge the two design-life targets and describe how QC intensity and documentation depth are calibrated to each. This demonstrates to evaluators that the Proponent understands the project's differentiated quality requirements. **ASSUMPTION: Cold Storage QC scope is reduced relative to main building due to simpler occupancy, unheated condition, and shorter design life; specific Cold Storage QC checklist items TBD post-award.**

---

### C-005: Proposal-Stage QM vs. Post-Award QM Plan

At proposal stage, the QM narrative communicates commitment and approach, not a complete operational quality plan. Details such as specific inspection frequency, QC tooling, personnel assignments, and checklist formats are appropriately deferred to the post-award Contractor Quality Plan (not required in the proposal). The narrative should be clear about this distinction to avoid over-promising and under-delivering.

---

### C-005a: Scoring Differentiation — What Distinguishes a High-Scoring QM Narrative

The QM narrative contributes to 3 pts of the 10-pt Project Delivery Plan score (RFP §8.3, p. 26; Construction Methodology sub-criterion). Since all compliant Proponents will state the same RFP-mandated obligations, the differentiators that earn full marks are the credibility and specificity of the *how*, not the repetition of the *what*. (Source: RFP §8.3, p. 26; Lensing item D-002)

**Baseline (meets minimum):** Restates RFP obligations (AHJ conformity, discipline inspections, written reports, deficiency correction, substantial performance certification). This demonstrates awareness but not methodology depth.

**Differentiators for full marks:**
1. **Named QC touchpoints per milestone:** A concrete table mapping each design submission milestone and each construction critical milestone to specific inspection actions, responsible parties, and deliverables — not just "inspections will occur"
2. **Cross-discipline coordination mechanism:** A described process for how discipline QC reviews are coordinated (conflict logs, coordination meetings, clash resolution protocol) — demonstrating integrated management rather than siloed inspections
3. **Hold-point commitment:** Explicit identification of mandatory inspection-before-cover points for concealed work, showing the Proponent understands construction-sequence QC risk
4. **Financial consequence awareness:** Linking QC performance to the Owner's 2.5x holdback mechanism (RFP §7.3.7), demonstrating that the Proponent understands the financial incentive for upstream quality
5. **Design-life proportionality:** Acknowledging that 50-year and 20-year design life targets require different QC intensity, showing engineering judgment rather than boilerplate quality language
6. **Post-award plan commitment:** Clearly distinguishing proposal-stage commitments from the detailed Contractor Quality Plan to be developed post-award, showing maturity and honesty

**Application:** When drafting, ensure the narrative goes beyond restating obligations. The evaluator is reading multiple proposals; specificity, credibility, and structural organization are the differentiators.

---

### C-006: Document Access Obligation — Owner's Right to Inspect

The RFP §7.3 (p. 20) requires the Design-Builder to "provide access to drawings, specifications and other design documents for the Owner, the Project Manager, and any other consultants retained directly by the Owner." This is a continuous obligation during construction, not a one-time handover event. The QM narrative should confirm this access right explicitly.

---

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Comprehensiveness vs. Proposal Length
**Trade-off:** A fully detailed QM plan (inspection checklists, non-conformance forms, NMS module lists) would exceed proposal page limits and obscure the key message. A narrative that is too thin fails to demonstrate methodology depth.

**Recommended Balance:** Describe the QM framework in 2–4 pages of narrative with tables for inspection milestones, document types, and corrective action classification. Reference that a detailed Contractor Quality Plan will be developed post-award. This satisfies the evaluator's need for evidence of methodology without overwhelming the proposal.

---

### T-002: Prescriptive Inspection Schedule vs. Schedule Flexibility
**Trade-off:** Committing to specific inspection frequencies (e.g., "daily during foundations") may be unachievable if construction schedule compresses or stretches. However, a vague "as required" commitment undermines the RFP's intent.

**Recommended Balance:** Commit to the RFP's stated minimums (Architect: monthly minimum; other disciplines: per approved schedule and at critical milestones) and state that specific frequency will be confirmed in the post-award 20-day baseline schedule. Name the critical milestones explicitly.

---

### T-003: NMS Adoption vs. Practical Implementation Cost
**Trade-off:** Full NMS adoption (licensed software, module selection, training) has a cost that some proponents may want to avoid. Partial adoption or "NMS-aligned" format reduces that burden but may be seen as non-compliance with the RFP recommendation.

**Recommended Balance:** Recommend NMS format in the narrative (consistent with RFP §7.2 language), and commit to agreeing the precise standard with Owner and Project Manager post-award. This positions the Proponent as cooperative and professional without creating an unbudgeted compliance obligation.

---

### T-004: Deficiency Process — Level of Detail in QM Narrative vs. DEL-08-02
**Trade-off:** The formal deficiency process is primarily covered in DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management Narrative). Over-detailing it here creates duplication and potential inconsistency. Under-addressing it ignores a financially significant QC obligation.

**Recommended Balance:** In the QM narrative, summarize the deficiency management process at the QC level (punch lists, formal review, expeditious correction, holdback acknowledgement) and cross-reference DEL-08-02 for full detail. This satisfies R-QM-09 without duplicating DEL-08-02 content.

---

## Examples

### EX-001: Design QC Checkpoint at 60% Detailed Design

**Context:** 60% Detailed Design package submitted to Owner for review.

**Design QC Process:**
1. Structural engineer reviews architectural plans for load paths, column sizing, and bay floor slab reinforcing (including sump construction) compatibility.
2. Mechanical engineer reviews for HVAC duct routes, fire apparatus bay direct exhaust system layout (2 apparatus per bay per Addendum 03 §1.12), and generator sizing confirmation.
3. Electrical engineer reviews for electrical room location, transfer switch provisions, solar-ready electrical rough-ins (per Addendum 03 §1.17).
4. Plumbing engineer reviews for 2" water fill station locations (fire bay + PW bay per Addendum 03 §1.16) and sump drainage routing.
5. QA/QC Lead conducts cross-discipline conflict log review; any open conflicts resolved before 60% package is issued.
6. All discipline leads sign off 60% package; Architect/PE certifies drawings.
7. Package submitted to Owner with conflict resolution log showing all items closed.

**Outcome:** Owner receives a coordinated 60% package that reflects multi-discipline QC, reducing Owner review cycle time and comments.

---

### EX-002: Critical Milestone Inspection — Apparatus Bay Slab-on-Grade with Sumps

**Context:** Apparatus bay floor slab pour is a critical construction QC milestone for the 50-year design life.

**Construction QC Inspection:**
1. Pre-pour inspection: Structural engineer verifies slab reinforcing, vapour barrier, sump former location, and drainage slope per design.
2. Concrete supplier certifications verified (mix design, admixtures for durability and freeze-thaw resistance appropriate to Alberta climate).
3. Pour inspection: Site Superintendent observes concrete placement, consolidation, and screeding.
4. Post-pour: Curing records and cylinder test results logged; any non-conformances (slump, air content out of specification) escalated immediately.
5. Written inspection report prepared by structural engineer; filed in on-site document records.
6. Inspection report included with corresponding progress draw submission.

**Outcome:** Apparatus bay slab certified for 50-year design life with corrosion-resistant sump installation; records support future warranty claims if required. Deficiency holdback exposure minimized through documented inspection at the critical pour milestone.

---

### EX-003: Documentation QC — Professional Seal on Change Document

**Context:** Structural change order required to modify apparatus bay roof beam sizing.

**Documentation QC Process:**
1. Structural engineer prepares revised beam sizing calculations and revised structural drawing.
2. Design QC review: architect confirms revised beam fits within ceiling void and does not affect HVAC routes.
3. Revised structural drawing stamped and signed by Alberta-registered Structural Engineer.
4. Change document issued under agreed document numbering scheme (e.g., "S-CD-003 Rev A").
5. On-site files updated; RFI and change notice referencing original issue closed.
6. Owner/PM notified per change management protocol (cross-referenced to DEL-07-01).

**Outcome:** Professional seal provides legal and code-compliance confidence; document trail supports future building permit amendments and AHJ inspections if required.

---

### EX-004: Deficiency Process Integration with QC — Mechanical Systems

**Context:** Commissioning identifies that the bunker gear ventilation system is not achieving the design airflow rate (fails to meet Addendum 03 §1.14 requirement).

**QC Corrective Action and Deficiency Process:**
1. Commissioning Coordinator logs the item as a non-conformance in the deficiency list; monetary value estimated based on corrective work required.
2. Mechanical engineer (responsible discipline) reviews and confirms the non-conformance; determines root cause (ductwork installation deviation from design).
3. Corrective action assigned: mechanical contractor re-routes affected ductwork per design intent; target completion within 10 working days.
4. Mechanical engineer re-inspects and confirms corrective work completes; re-commissioning test confirms design airflow achieved.
5. Deficiency item closed in the consolidated list; written confirmation issued.
6. Owner notified of closure; holdback reduced by 2.5x the estimated value of the corrected item per RFP §7.3.7.

**Outcome:** Deficiency resolved before Substantial Performance; Owner's holdback released on this item; bunker gear ventilation performs per design life requirement.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No conflicts identified between primary sources for this deliverable. RFP §7.2 and §7.3 address QA/QC from complementary perspectives (documentation and construction administration respectively) with no contradictions. RFP §7.3.7 (Deficiencies) provides additional process requirements that integrate with rather than conflict with §7.2. Addendum 03 contains no QA/QC-specific modifications.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
