# Procedure — DEL-07-05: Quality Management Narrative

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps for developing the Quality Management Narrative for the Public Services Building proposal. The narrative is a required section of the proposal demonstrating the Proponent's QA/QC approach per RFP §7.2 (Quality Management — QA/QC and Documentation, p. 19–20) and RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration, p. 20–21). It also addresses the deficiency management interface per RFP §7.3.7 (p. 23). It contributes to the Project Delivery Plan scoring (OBJ-002, Construction Methodology 3 pts) and to risk transparency (OBJ-008).

### Step 2: Draft Opening Section — Work Standards and AHJ Conformity

**Action:**
1. Open the Quality Management Narrative with a statement of the baseline work standard, using RFP §7.2 language:
   - All work completed to current industry standards and good construction Best Practice
   - Conformity to all applicable codes, regulations, standards, trade associations, and local by-laws
   - AHJ conformity is the Design-Builder's responsibility
   - Work performed per manufacturer's instructions, by qualified and licensed trade professionals
2. Note that the project involves a combined public safety facility (Fire Hall + Public Works Operations + Cold Storage) and that QM must address multi-occupancy systems including apparatus exhaust, bay sumps, emergency generator, water fill stations (2" minimum per Addendum 03 §1.16), and solar-capable roofing (per Addendum 03 §1.17).
3. State that the Design-Builder, as Prime Contractor under the Alberta OH&S Act, maintains full responsibility for quality controls across the project.

**Output:** Opening paragraph(s) of narrative (~200–300 words).

---

### Step 3: Draft Design Quality Control Section

**Action:**
1. Identify all design disciplines in the project (architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, specialty as required per DEL-07-03).
2. Map the five RFP §7.1.8 design submission milestones to QC touchpoints:

| Milestone | QC Touchpoint |
|---|---|
| Building Design Development (BDD) | Discipline lead reviews; cross-discipline conflict check; Architect certification |
| 60% Detailed Design | Discipline lead sign-offs; coordination conflicts resolved; PE review |
| Foundation IFC (if needed) | Structural engineer sign-off; civil coordination; geotechnical compliance confirmed |
| 100% Building Detailed Design | Full discipline review; all conflicts cleared; PE stamps applied |
| 100% IFC Detailed Design Package (full) | Final discipline certifications; all documents sealed by Alberta-registered professionals |

3. Describe the cross-discipline coordination check conducted at each milestone (role of QA/QC Lead or Architect as coordinator).
4. State that all applicable documents are sealed by Alberta-registered Architects/Engineers per RFP §7.2.
5. Describe corrective action process for design non-conformances discovered at a QC gate: design revision required, conflicts logged, resolution verified before advancing to next milestone.
6. Note that the Foundation IFC milestone is listed as "if needed" per RFP §7.1.8, p. 18 — include it in the QC framework as a conditional milestone that will be activated if a foundation IFC submission is required.

**Output:** "Design Quality Control" narrative section (~400–500 words + milestone table).

---

### Step 4: Draft Construction Quality Control Section

**Action:**
1. Describe Site Superintendent role: on-site supervision and quality controls for full project duration (per RFP §7.3, p. 20).
2. State discipline inspection commitments:
   - **Architect:** Minimum monthly site inspections; written report of findings with each progress draw
   - **Other disciplines (civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, specialty):** Inspections per approved project schedule and at all critical milestones; written report of findings with each progress draw
3. Define critical inspection milestones:

| Milestone | Inspecting Disciplines | Key QC Items |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation bearing surface | Structural, Civil | Bearing pressure verification, excavation review, geotechnical confirmation |
| Foundation concrete placement | Structural | Reinforcing placement, concrete mix compliance, test cylinders |
| Structural frame completion | Structural, Architectural | Connection verification, load path, slab-on-grade with sumps review |
| Envelope closure | Architectural, Mechanical | Air sealing, vapour barrier continuity, thermal bridging review |
| MEP systems rough-in | Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing | Ductwork routing (including apparatus bay exhaust), piping routes, conduit runs before concealment |
| MEP systems functional testing | Mechanical, Electrical | System startup, performance testing, safety system verification (generator, fill stations) |
| Final assembly | Architectural, all disciplines | Interior finishes, equipment installation, commissioning readiness; bunker gear locker ventilation confirmation |

4. Describe the substantial performance certification process (per RFP §7.3, p. 21): each discipline consultant performs site visit and issues letter certifying construction is in general conformance with Construction Documents. Reference the five closeout documents required for Substantial Performance (per RFP §7.5, p. 24): Occupancy Permit, Final commissioning documents, All O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, Legal Survey.
5. Describe the shop drawing and submittal review process: Design-Builder's consultants review all shop drawings, samples, and submittals from subcontractors for compliance with intent of approved working drawings, specifications, and original design per OSR (per RFP §7.3, p. 20).
6. Describe on-site document file maintenance: continuous on-site files of RFIs, site instructions, change notices, change orders, clarifications, field reports, progress reports, control reports, H&S Plan, and all other construction documents (per RFP §7.3, p. 20). Access provided to Owner, Project Manager, and Owner-retained consultants.

7. **Commissioning QC Handoff (Step 4b):** Describe the transition from construction QC to commissioning QC. This operationalizes Guidance C-004 ("Commissioning is not a separate quality phase; it is the verification step"). (Source: Guidance C-004; DEL-08-01 cross-reference; Lensing item C-002)
   - Identify which construction QC artefacts transfer to commissioning: completed inspection reports for all critical milestones, non-conformance log (open and closed items), test results (concrete cylinders, air barrier, MEP functional pre-tests), as-built markups for concealed work
   - Specify handoff responsibility: Site Superintendent and QC Manager compile the construction QC package and formally transmit to the Commissioning Coordinator (or equivalent role per DEL-08-01)
   - Handoff timing: construction QC package compiled when all critical milestone inspections are complete and all critical/major non-conformances are closed; handoff occurs before commissioning testing begins
   - Describe how commissioning-identified deficiencies feed back into the same corrective action and deficiency process described in Step 5 (single process, not a parallel system)
   - Cross-reference DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Narrative) for detailed commissioning procedures; this step addresses only the QC interface and artefact transfer

**Output:** "Construction Quality Control" narrative section (~500–700 words + critical milestone table + commissioning QC handoff paragraph).

---

### Step 5: Draft Corrective Action and Deficiency Process Section

**Action:**
1. Describe non-conformance identification sources: Design-Builder's consultants, Site Superintendent, Owner, Project Manager, Compliance Consultant (per RFP §7.3, p. 20).
2. Describe classification approach (ASSUMPTION — standard industry practice):
   - **Critical:** Safety risk, code violation, or structural/performance failure; immediate correction required, no phase advance permitted
   - **Major:** Functional deficiency not immediately safety-critical; corrective action required before system operation or phase advance
   - **Minor:** Cosmetic or finish deficiency; corrective action required before final completion
3. Describe corrective action log: unique ID, description, responsible party, severity, target completion date, verification method, and closure date.
4. State commitment to "expeditiously" correcting all construction deficiencies identified by any authority (per RFP §7.3, p. 20).
5. Describe escalation path with decision authority and response timeframes at each level (Source: Lensing item D-001):

   | Escalation Level | Role | Decision Authority | Maximum Response Time | Auto-Escalation Trigger |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Level 1 | Field QC Manager | Authorize minor corrective actions; assign responsible trade; set target date | 24 hours from identification | Item unresolved or unacknowledged after 24 hours |
   | Level 2 | Site Superintendent | Authorize major corrective actions; approve schedule impact; halt work at affected area if safety risk | 48 hours from Level 1 escalation | Item unresolved after 48 hours at Level 2 or safety risk identified |
   | Level 3 | Project Manager | Authorize corrective actions with cost/schedule impact; approve change orders for corrective work; notify Owner if contractual implications | 5 business days from Level 2 escalation | Item unresolved after 5 business days at Level 3 or cost impact exceeds TBD threshold |
   | Level 4 | Owner's Representative | Final authority on acceptance, rejection, or alternative resolution; holdback decisions per RFP §7.3.7 | Per Owner's discretion | Critical items; items with contractual, code, or safety implications |

   **ASSUMPTION: Response timeframes are standard construction QC practice; specific timeframes TBD in post-award Contractor Quality Plan. Auto-escalation triggers ensure items do not stall at any level.**
6. Describe the formal deficiency process (per RFP §7.3.7, p. 23):
   - Trade punch lists established and submitted before confirming readiness for formal deficiency review
   - Formal Deficiency Meeting held to agree approach and dates for deficiency review(s)
   - Comprehensive inspection of construction work; comprehensive deficiency list prepared with monetary values assigned to each item for Substantial Performance calculation (including approved change orders)
   - Owner may retain up to 2.5 times the calculated deficiency cost until all deficiencies are corrected
   - 12-month warranty period review and list of outstanding warranty issues prepared
   - Single consolidated deficiency list maintained incorporating Design-Builder's deficiencies and Owner's identified deficiencies
   - Owner may add deficiencies to the list up to 6 weeks after occupancy; these follow the same process for resolution
   - All deficiencies corrected expeditiously to the satisfaction of the Owner and the OSR prior to claiming total completion and final payment
7. Cross-reference DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management Narrative) for the full detailed deficiency process; this section provides the QM framework overview.

**Output:** "Corrective Action and Deficiency Management" narrative section (~400–500 words + classification table).

---

### Step 6: Draft Documentation Quality Control Section

**Action:**
1. State recommendation for NMS (National Master Specification) format for all project documents.
2. State commitment to establishing and agreeing a document numbering and formatting standard with the Owner and Project Manager within the post-award baseline schedule period (20 calendar days per RFP §7.2, Schedule Control provision).
3. Describe document numbering approach (ASSUMPTION — standard practice; example):
   - Drawings: by discipline prefix (A = Architectural, S = Structural, M = Mechanical, E = Electrical, P = Plumbing, C = Civil) and sequential number with revision suffix (e.g., A-001 Rev A)
   - Specifications: NMS Division structure (Division 01 = General Requirements, Division 03 = Concrete, etc.)
   - Field documents: by type prefix (RFI-001, SI-001, CCN-001, CO-001)
4. Describe as-built documentation process:
   - Subtrades provide red-line markups of actual installed conditions as work proceeds
   - Design consultants verify accuracy of red-lines
   - Formal as-built drawings prepared before handover to Owner in DWG + PDF format (architectural/MEP) and PDF (all others) per RFP §7.5, p. 24
5. Describe O&M manual production: two hard copies in 3-ring binders separated by labelled tabs, plus complete digital copy in Owner-approved format; include product/manufacturer warranties and guarantee certificates, and all maintenance equipment and testing certificates of new systems, equipment, and materials (per RFP §7.5, p. 24).
6. Confirm professional seal requirement: all planning, design, and construction documents, reports, and change documents requiring professional design services sealed by Alberta-registered Architect or Engineer.

**Output:** "Documentation Quality Control" narrative section (~300–400 words).

---

### Step 7: Cross-Reference and Consistency Check

**Action:**
1. Verify requirements coverage: review each requirement R-QM-01 through R-QM-10 from Specification.md and confirm the corresponding narrative section addresses it.
2. Verify RFP language alignment: confirm the narrative uses (or closely paraphrases) RFP §7.2 and §7.3 language for key obligations, including:
   - "in general conformance with the Construction Documents" (substantial performance certification)
   - "expeditiously correct all construction deficiencies" (deficiency correction)
   - "a standard to be established and agreed to by the Owner and the Project Manager" (documentation standard)
3. Verify cross-document consistency:
   - **DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology):** Ensure QA/QC references in that document are consistent with this narrative; no contradictions in responsibility assignments.
   - **DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach):** Ensure discipline consultants identified there are referenced here as inspection parties.
   - **DEL-08-01 (Commissioning):** Ensure commissioning QC handoff is consistent with commissioning narrative.
   - **DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies):** Ensure deficiency process described here is consistent with and complementary to the detailed narrative in DEL-08-02; no contradictions in holdback amount (2.5x), timeline, or list structure.
   - **DEL-09-01 (Schedule):** Confirm inspection milestone language is consistent with scheduled milestones.
4. Verify terminology consistency (refer to Guidance Vocabulary Note for QA/QC/QM/OSR definitions):
   - "Quality Assurance" vs. "Quality Control" used appropriately (QA = proactive/process; QC = reactive/product; see Guidance Vocabulary Note)
   - "Quality Management" used for the overall approach; "QA/QC" used only when referencing the RFP compound term or the combined framework
   - "OSR" (Owner's Statement of Requirements) defined on first use in the narrative
   - "Substantial Performance" matches CCDC 14-2013 usage
   - "Deficiency List" consistent with RFP §7.3.7 and DEL-08-02 usage
   - "Compliance Consultant" used where RFP §7.3 specifies this role
   - "IFC" (Issued for Construction) consistent with RFP §7.1.8 language
5. Verify source citations: all non-trivial statements cite RFP section and page; inferred items labeled ASSUMPTION.

**Output:** Consistency-checked narrative ready for proposal assembly.

---

### Step 8: Final Review and Format Preparation

**Action:**
1. Perform grammar, spelling, and formatting check.
2. Confirm narrative tone: professional, confident, and operationally credible. Avoid vague assertions ("we will deliver quality"); prefer specific commitments ("the Architect will perform minimum monthly inspections with written reports of findings along with each progress draw").
3. Confirm the narrative fits within proposal constraints:
   - Located under RFP §7.2 in proposal (per RFP §4.3 / C-02 section order constraint)
   - Supports the main headings required by RFP
4. Confirm that deficiency process summary cross-references DEL-08-02 without creating contradictions.
5. Prepare integrated narrative section for assembly into the overall proposal document.

**Output:** Final Quality Management Narrative, ready for proposal assembly.
