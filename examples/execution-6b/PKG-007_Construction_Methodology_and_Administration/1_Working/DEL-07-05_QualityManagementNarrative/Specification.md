- Construction-phase quality control: site inspection schedule, critical milestone inspections, substantial performance certification
- Documentation quality control: National Master Specification (NMS) format recommendation, document numbering and formatting standards, professional sealing requirements
- Corrective action and non-conformance management process
- Deficiency management process (formal deficiency review, monetary valuation, holdback, warranty review)
- Integration with commissioning phase QC (cross-referenced to DEL-08-01)

**Excludes:**
- Detailed construction site safety inspection procedures (covered in DEL-07-01 — Health & Safety section)
- Full commissioning narrative (covered in DEL-08-01)
- Detailed deficiency management and warranty procedures (covered in DEL-08-02 and DEL-08-03; this narrative addresses the QC interface only)
