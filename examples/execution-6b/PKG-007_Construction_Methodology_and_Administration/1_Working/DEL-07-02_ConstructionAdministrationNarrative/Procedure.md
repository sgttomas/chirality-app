| H&S Plan | References H&S Plan (§7.3 file management); does not duplicate H&S approach | DEL-07-01 owns H&S Plan details |
| Monthly progress/control reports | Owns content and format | DEL-07-04 owns distribution and meeting context |
| Quality standards | References standards; does not define them | DEL-07-05 owns quality standards and NMS format |
| Consultant inspection protocol | Owns (Architect monthly; all disciplines at milestones/SP) | DEL-07-05 may overlap — confirm boundary |
| Superintendent role | Owns | DEL-07-01 references superintendent; ensure descriptions are consistent |

3. Flag any contradictions or unclear boundaries for resolution.

**Output:** Cross-reference boundary table; list of flagged issues.

---

### Step 4: Draft the Construction Administration Narrative (8–16 hours)

**Action:**
1. Using input from Steps 1–3, draft the narrative in this recommended structure:

| **Site Services and Utility Coordination** | Which utilities require new connections; coordination process with Utility Provider(s); sequencing; drainage management (no on-site storm sewer) |

2. Apply Guidance.md principles (P-001 through P-007) to ensure specificity and credibility.
3. Mark any unresolved TBD items (e.g., CCDC 14/Appendix J thresholds) clearly.

**Output:** Draft narrative (~2,500–4,000 words expected).

---

### Step 5: RFP Compliance Traceability (2–3 hours)

**Action:**
1. Construct a traceability matrix mapping each RFP §7.3 bullet (p. 20) and each subsection provision (§7.3.1–§7.3.3, p. 21) to the corresponding narrative section.
2. Confirm proposal placement: narrative positioned as Section 7.3 per RFP §4.3 structure.
3. Verify any page/word count constraints are observed (check RFP §4.3 for submission format rules).

**RFP §7.3 Traceability Matrix (template):**

| RFP §7.3 Requirement | Narrative Section | Pass? |
|---|---|---|
| Site Superintendent for supervision and quality controls | On-Site Superintendent | [ ] |
| On-site files: RFIs, site instructions, change notices, change orders, clarifications, field reports, monthly progress/control reports, H&S Plan, other documents | Document Management | [ ] |
| Access to drawings/specs for Owner, PM, Owner-retained consultants | Document Access for Owner and PM | [ ] |
| Shop drawing/sample/submittal review per working drawings and OSR intent | Shop Drawing Review | [ ] |
| Obtain/assemble warranties, O&M manuals, as-builts | Closeout Document Assembly | [ ] |
| Construct per IFC drawings and specifications | IFC Construction Commitment | [ ] |
| Expediently correct deficiencies | Quality Control Oversight | [ ] |
| Maintain milestone dates per approved schedule | Schedule Maintenance | [ ] |
| Maintain and enforce strict H&S policy | Health and Safety Enforcement | [ ] |
| Consultant regular inspections; Architect monthly; all disciplines at milestones; all disciplines at SP with conformance letters | Consultant Inspection Protocol | [ ] |
| Daily cleaning and site security (barricades/fencing) | Daily Cleaning and Site Security | [ ] |
| Final cleaning before final inspection (grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, foreign materials) | Final Pre-Occupancy Cleaning | [ ] |
| Transportation and storage logistics responsibility; site/lot as laydown area | Transportation and Storage Logistics | [ ] |
| Complete and coordinate all utility connections with Utility Provider(s) | Site Services and Utility Coordination | [ ] |

**Output:** Completed traceability matrix; updated narrative draft if gaps found.

---

### Step 6: Internal Review by Construction Manager and PM (3–5 hours)

**Action:**
1. Distribute draft narrative, Specification.md, and traceability matrix to Construction Manager and PM.
2. Request feedback on:
   - Accuracy: Do described processes match actual project management practices?
   - Completeness: Are all RFP §7.3 elements adequately covered?
   - Credibility: Does the narrative demonstrate competence that merits >=80% scoring (aspiration target; minimum pass: >=70% per RFP §8.3)?
   - Tone: Is the language professional and clear?
3. Collect and incorporate feedback; resolve outstanding TBD items.

**Output:** Review comments and responses; revised narrative draft.

---

### Step 7: Cross-Document Consistency Final Check (1–2 hours)

**Action:**
1. Re-read DEL-07-01, DEL-07-04, DEL-07-05 and verify final consistency:

| Check | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|
| Terminology: "superintendent" | Same role description in all PKG-007 deliverables |
| Terminology: "monthly progress report" | Consistent content definition (DEL-07-02) and distribution context (DEL-07-04) |
| Quality control | DEL-07-02 references DEL-07-05 standards; does not contradict them |
| H&S enforcement | DEL-07-02 references DEL-07-01 H&S Plan; does not duplicate methodology |
| Consultant inspection protocol | Consistent between DEL-07-02 and DEL-07-05 (if QM narrative addresses inspections) |

2. Confirm Conflict Table in Guidance.md reflects any unresolved conflicts.

**Output:** Final consistency confirmation; updated Conflict Table if needed.

---

### Step 8: Proposal Submission QA (1–2 hours)

**Action:**
1. Spellcheck and grammar review; manual review of technical terms.
2. Formatting check: consistent fonts, headings, spacing per proposal style guide.
3. Citation accuracy: RFP section references, CCDC 14/Appendix J references are correct.
4. Final compliance audit: confirm all R-CA-001 through R-CA-014 are addressed.
5. Proposal Manager sign-off for inclusion in Section 7.3 of the proposal PDF.

**Output:** Final approved narrative; Construction Manager and Proposal Manager sign-off.

---

### Step 9: Post-Submission Feedback and Revision Loop (*Lensing D-002*)

**Purpose:** Ensure that TBD items resolved after initial submission (e.g., Appendix J review, team confirmation of assumptions) and cross-document consistency findings identified post-submission are captured and fed back into future narrative revisions.

**Action:**
1. After initial submission or when TBD items are resolved (e.g., CCDC 14/Appendix J thresholds confirmed, superintendent named, utility providers identified):
   - Update the relevant documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure) to replace TBD entries with confirmed values.
   - Update the Consolidated Assumptions Register in Specification.md to mark resolved assumptions.
2. If cross-document consistency issues are identified post-submission (e.g., terminology misalignment with DEL-07-01, DEL-07-04, or DEL-07-05):
   - Record the finding in the Conflict Table (Guidance.md) or resolve immediately if straightforward.
   - Revise all affected documents to restore consistency.
3. If evaluation feedback or Owner questions reveal narrative gaps:
   - Record the gap, trace it to the relevant requirement (R-CA-001 through R-CA-017), and draft a revision.
   - Re-run the Step 5 traceability matrix and Step 7 consistency check on the revised narrative.
4. Maintain a revision log noting what changed, why, and when.

**Output:** Updated narrative (if applicable); updated assumptions register; revision log entry.

## Notes

- **Source update:** The prior version of this Procedure noted "TBD — RFP §7.3 source not yet accessed." RFP §7.3 and §7.3.1–§7.3.3 have now been read (pp. 20–21). Steps and verification criteria have been updated to reflect actual RFP requirements.
- **TBD:** CCDC 14-2013 and Appendix J clauses affecting superintendent authority, RFI turnaround, and change order thresholds — confirm in Step 1 and resolve before Step 4 draft.
- **ASSUMPTION:** The Design-Builder will provide a named or qualified Site Superintendent whose authority over field decisions is established before construction begins.
- **Role terminology:** This Procedure uses "Site Superintendent" (field-level) and "Construction Manager" (project-level) as normalized role titles per Guidance.md C-004a (*Lensing F-002*). See Guidance.md for role boundary definitions.
- **Integration note:** This procedure coordinates with DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission Package), which governs final PDF assembly. Deliver approved narrative to Proposal Manager on the agreed internal schedule to prevent PDF assembly delays.
