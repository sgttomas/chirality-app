## Conditions

The narrative must address the following site and project conditions that drive construction administration requirements:

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupied adjacent operations** | Existing Town of Penhold facilities remain operational during construction; not a schedule-driven endeavour | RFP OSR §10.2.3 |
| **Multi-building site** | Three buildings: main PSB, Cold Storage, Pickled-Sand Storage — each with distinct administration needs | RFP OSR §10.2.2 |
| **Fire Department operational continuity** | Fire apparatus (4 large + 4 small) and up to 40 personnel continue operating during construction | RFP OSR §10.3.5 |
| **Public Works operational continuity** | Public Works operates 20 personnel (future 50) and a large fleet during construction | RFP OSR §10.3.5 |
| **Site laydown available** | Building site and lot available to Design-Builder as laydown area for the full duration of the project | RFP §7.3.2 |
| **No on-site storm sewer** | Proper drainage management required; no storm sewer on-site — utility provider coordination essential | RFP OSR §11.2 |
| **Utility Provider(s)** | TBD — specific utility providers serving the Penhold site (e.g., ATCO Gas, FortisAlberta, Telus, or other applicable providers) to be confirmed; RFP §7.3.3 requires coordination with Utility Provider(s) for all service connections | RFP §7.3.3; *Lensing B-001* |
| **Design-Builder as Prime Contractor** | Design-Builder is "Prime Contractor" under Alberta OH&S Act; responsible for all H&S duties and site enforcement | RFP §7.2 |
| **Compliance Consultant oversight** | Owner may retain a Compliance Consultant; Design-Builder must expediently correct deficiencies they identify | RFP §7.3 |
