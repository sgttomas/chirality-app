# Guidance — Construction Administration Narrative (DEL-07-02)

## Purpose

The Construction Administration Narrative (DEL-07-02) communicates to the Owner (Town of Penhold) and Evaluation Committee how the Design-Build team will manage day-to-day construction activities, oversee quality, process and resolve field decisions, maintain required documentation, and coordinate logistics and utility connections during construction. This narrative is a required component of **RFP Section 7.3** and contributes to the **Construction Methodology evaluation criterion (3 pts)** under the Project Delivery Plan (OBJ-002).

The Evaluation Committee uses this narrative to assess whether the proponent can deliver credible, professionally managed construction administration. A strong narrative demonstrates operational competence, transparent communication, and respect for the Owner's oversight rights — not merely an acknowledgement that these functions exist.

**Scoring Context (OBJ-002, RFP §8.2):**
- Design Methodology: 3 pts
- Construction Methodology: 3 pts (this narrative contributes here, shared across PKG-007)
- Commissioning/Training/Closeout: 2 pts
- Detailed Project Schedule: 2 pts

**Scoring Thresholds (clarified per *Lensing E-002*):**
- **Minimum pass target:** "Good" (>=70% per RFP §8.3) — the baseline at which the narrative is considered adequate.
- **Aspiration target:** "Very Good" (80%) or "Exceptional" (100%) — achievable when the narrative exceeds basic expectation through specificity, demonstrated past practice, and innovation.
- The 70% threshold is the floor; the team should author with an 80%+ aspiration. See Specification.md Verification for the formal pass criterion.

## Principles

### P-001: Clear Superintendent Authority and Accountability

The narrative should establish:
- A named (or clearly described) on-site superintendent with defined authority for day-to-day decisions
- Clear escalation paths for decisions exceeding superintendent authority (e.g., design changes, significant cost impacts)
- Named roles accountable for key functions: RFI processing, shop drawing review, progress reporting, deficiency tracking

**Why:** The Owner needs confidence that decisions are made promptly by qualified personnel and that authority is unambiguous. Ambiguity in authority creates delays and disputes.

---

### P-002: Structured Document Management Covering All RFP-Required Types

The RFP requires on-site files for a specific set of document types (RFP §7.3, p. 20): RFIs, site instructions, contemplated change notices, change orders, clarifications, field reports, monthly progress reports, monthly control reports, site-specific H&S Plan, and all other applicable construction documents. The narrative must address each type explicitly.

**Why:** Selective coverage of document types (e.g., addressing only RFIs and ignoring control reports) will be visible to evaluators and signals incomplete administrative capacity.

---

### P-003: Quality Control as Continuous Oversight, Not Just Final Inspection

The narrative should describe:
- Daily and critical-milestone on-site inspections by the superintendent
- The consultant inspection protocol exactly as required (Architect monthly; all disciplines at critical milestones and substantial performance with written conformance letters per RFP §7.3)
- How deficiencies identified by any party (Design-Builder, Owner, Project Manager, Compliance Consultant) are tracked and resolved

**Why:** The RFP explicitly names the Compliance Consultant as a party whose deficiency findings must be corrected. The narrative must acknowledge this oversight role — not just the Design-Builder's internal QC.

---

### P-004: Shop Drawing Review as a Formal Gating Process

The narrative should describe:
- Submittal requirements and expected lead times
- Review authority (Design-Builder engineer and/or consultant Designer of Record)
- Approval/rejection turnaround expectations
- How design conflicts identified during review are escalated and resolved
- The requirement to verify compliance with approved working drawings AND with the intent of the original design per the OSR (RFP §7.3, p. 20)

**Why:** Shop drawing review is a formal gating mechanism that prevents non-compliant fabrication. The OSR reference in RFP §7.3 specifically ties shop drawing compliance back to the Owner's original design intent — not merely the working drawings.

---

### P-005: Cleaning as Part of Handover Readiness

The narrative should distinguish:
- **Daily cleaning** (RFP §7.3.1): Safe, tidy site throughout construction; site secured at end of each workday
- **Final pre-occupancy cleaning** (RFP §7.3.1): Complete removal of grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, and all foreign materials from inside and outside — triggered before final inspection and Final Payment

**Why:** RFP §7.3.1 specifically lists the materials to be removed in final cleaning. The narrative should mirror this list to demonstrate RFP awareness.

**Barricade and Fencing Clarification (*Lensing C-002*):**
RFP §7.3.1 requires "barricades and temporary/permanent fencing as required" but does not specify what triggers this requirement or what standard governs it. The narrative should clarify:
- When fencing is required (e.g., whenever active construction zones are adjacent to operational Fire Department or Public Works areas; whenever excavation or elevation hazards exist; whenever public access is possible)
- Whether temporary fencing follows Alberta OH&S requirements for construction site perimeters or a project-specific standard — TBD
- Whether permanent fencing is part of the project scope or existing site infrastructure — TBD

This is necessary because the project site is adjacent to active emergency services operations (RFP OSR §10.3.5), making the distinction between "required" and "optional" fencing operationally significant.

---

### P-006: Logistics as an Enabler of Safe, Efficient Construction

The narrative should address:
- Material staging areas and sequencing
- Onsite and offsite storage provisions
- Traffic and access control to protect Fire Department and Public Works operational continuity during construction
- Waste management approach (see below)

**Why:** The project site will be adjacent to active Fire Department and Public Works operations. Poor logistics planning creates safety conflicts. The RFP site (12-acre, Lot 1 Block 1, Plan 212 1668) provides a building lot as laydown area (RFP §7.3.2), but its relationship to active facility operations must be considered.

**Waste Management Guidance (*Lensing B-003*):**
The narrative should address what a credible waste management approach includes:
- Construction waste handling procedures (segregation of materials on-site, bin placement)
- Recycling and diversion targets, if applicable (municipal or provincial requirements — TBD)
- Hazardous waste disposal approach (e.g., paint, solvents, adhesives)
- Disposal logistics: frequency of waste removal, contracted waste hauler, and disposal site
- Coordination with Town of Penhold waste management bylaws, if any — TBD

**Offsite Storage Decision Rationale (*Lensing F-003*):**
RFP §7.3.2 and R-CA-013 require describing "proper onsite and offsite storage." The narrative should address when offsite storage is warranted and what considerations apply:
- **When warranted:** Materials arriving before the site can accommodate them; high-value items requiring climate-controlled storage; items with long lead times that must be secured before site is ready; materials that pose safety risks if stored near active Fire Department/Public Works operations
- **Security considerations:** Offsite facility should be lockable, insured, and access-controlled; inventory tracking required
- **Insurance considerations:** CCIP coverage scope for offsite-stored materials — TBD (confirm with insurance advisor; see ASMP-003 in Specification.md Consolidated Assumptions Register)
- **Coordination with material staging sequencing:** Offsite storage must align with the construction schedule to ensure just-in-time delivery and avoid double-handling

---

### P-007: Utility Coordination as a Completion-Critical Function

The narrative should address:
- Which utilities require new connections (power, water, sanitary, telecommunications — ASSUMPTION based on OSR §11.2 and project type)
- How the Design-Builder will identify and contact Utility Provider(s)
- Coordination sequencing (utility connections typically on critical path)
- Special consideration: no on-site storm sewer (OSR §11.2); drainage must flow off-site

**Why:** RFP §7.3.3 requires the Design-Builder to "complete and coordinate" all utility connections with Utility Provider(s). This is a completion-critical function — delays in utility connections delay occupancy.

---

## Considerations

### C-001: Integration Boundaries with DEL-07-01 and DEL-07-05

- DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) covers the broader strategic approach: H&S Plan structure, staging strategy, permits, budget/schedule control, and communications approach.
- DEL-07-02 (this narrative) covers day-to-day construction administration: document management, field oversight, cleaning, logistics, and utility coordination.
- DEL-07-05 (Quality Management) covers QA/QC standards, documentation formats, and certification approaches.

**Consider:** All three narratives should be mutually supportive without content overlap. DEL-07-02 should reference DEL-07-01 for H&S and schedule context; reference DEL-07-05 for quality standards; and reference DEL-07-04 for meeting and reporting structure.

---

### C-002: Decision Authority Thresholds

- What RFI types can the Superintendent resolve vs. which require Designer input?
- What change order dollar thresholds require Owner approval vs. superintendent/CM authority?
- CCDC 14-2013 and Supplementary Conditions (Appendix J) may specify these thresholds — narrative should reflect those limits once known.

**Note:** These thresholds remain TBD pending Appendix J review. See Conflict Table.

---

### C-003: Monthly Progress Report vs. Meeting Report Boundary

RFP §7.3 requires monthly progress reports and monthly control reports as document management outputs. RFP §7.3.5 (DEL-07-04) also requires monthly progress reports issued with meeting agendas showing progress against milestones. There is natural overlap.

**Consider:** DEL-07-02 should clarify the content and format of monthly progress/control reports; DEL-07-04 should clarify the distribution cadence and meeting context. The reports themselves are a DEL-07-02 responsibility; the meeting is DEL-07-04's responsibility.

---

### C-004: Contractor Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP)

The Design-Builder has confirmed CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) as the insurance approach (DEC-011, Decomposition). The construction administration narrative does not need to re-state insurance details, but the superintendent's authority structure should acknowledge CCIP implications for incident reporting and claims management.

---

### C-004a: Role Terminology Normalization (*Lensing F-002*)

Multiple role titles are used across the four documents for overlapping functions. To maintain disciplined compliance coherence, all DEL-07-02 documents should use the following role definitions consistently:

| Role Title (Normative) | Function | Authority Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Site Superintendent** | On-site field supervisor responsible for day-to-day construction oversight, daily reporting, deficiency tracking, daily cleaning sign-off, site security | Per RFP §7.3 — the normative role title; field-level authority |
| **Construction Manager** | Overall project construction management; owns change order register, monthly progress/control reports, consultant coordination, logistics planning | Project-level authority; escalation point for superintendent |
| **Quality Lead** | QA/QC coordination (may be the superintendent or a dedicated role per team structure) | Quality-specific oversight |

**Usage rules:**
- Use "Site Superintendent" (not "Superintendent" alone) when referring to the RFP §7.3 on-site role.
- Use "Construction Manager" for project-level management functions (change order register, monthly reporting, consultant coordination).
- Do not use "Construction Manager" and "Site Superintendent" interchangeably for the same function. If both roles contribute to a function (e.g., deficiency tracking), state both roles and their respective responsibilities.
- In Procedure.md Records table, assign each record to one primary owner using these normalized titles.

---

### C-005: Substantial Performance Certification

RFP §7.3 (p. 21) requires that at substantial performance, "each discipline of the Design-Builder's consultant team shall perform a site visit and issue letter certifying the construction is in general conformance with the Construction Documents." This is a specific deliverable (letter from each discipline consultant) that should be identified in the narrative.

**Consider:** The narrative should list the expected discipline consultants who will provide conformance letters (ASSUMPTION: architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical at minimum).

---

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Centralized vs. Hybrid RFI Authority

**Option A — Centralized (single Design-Builder approver for all RFIs):**
- Pros: Consistent decisions, single point of accountability
- Cons: Slower turnaround; design team bottleneck for field questions

**Option B — Hybrid (Superintendent resolves field-interpretation RFIs; design conflicts escalate to Designer):**
- Pros: Faster resolution of routine field matters; reduces design team workload
- Cons: Risk of inconsistency if field interpretation boundaries are unclear

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach with published RFI category definitions and turnaround time commitments. This demonstrates operational maturity and Owner-confidence in process.

**Turnaround Time Target Rationale (*Lensing X-001*):**
When publishing turnaround time commitments for RFIs, shop drawing reviews, and change order processing, the narrative should state defensible targets grounded in the following reasoning:
- **RFI response:** 3–5 business days is a common industry standard for design-interpretation RFIs on projects of this scale. Field-interpretation RFIs (superintendent-resolved) should target 1–2 business days. Faster commitments are aspirational; slower commitments risk schedule impact and signal administrative weakness to evaluators. The 4-day example in EX-001 aligns with this range.
- **Shop drawing review:** 10–15 business days from receipt to disposition is typical for dual-party review (Design-Builder + Designer of Record). Shorter turnarounds may be appropriate for simple submittals; longer turnarounds risk delaying fabrication. State the standard turnaround and any exceptions for complex submittals.
- **Change order processing:** Acknowledgment within 2–3 business days; cost/schedule impact assessment within 5–10 business days; Owner-approved change orders issued within 5 business days of approval decision. These targets should be calibrated against CCDC 14/Appendix J obligations once confirmed (see CONF-CA-001).
- **General principle:** Commitments should be achievable, not aspirational — missed commitments erode credibility more than conservative commitments.

---

### T-002: Pre-Authorization vs. Change Order-as-You-Go

**Option A — Full pre-authorization (Owner approves all cost/schedule impacts before work begins):**
- Pros: Owner has full budget visibility; no surprises
- Cons: Can delay work, particularly for time-sensitive field conditions

**Option B — Proceed-with-documentation (Work proceeds; change orders formalized after):**
- Pros: Faster response to field conditions
- Cons: Owner has less cost control; dispute risk

**Recommendation:** Propose a threshold-based hybrid: field conditions within a defined contingency proceed without pre-authorization; changes exceeding threshold (TBD — pending CCDC 14/Appendix J review) require Owner approval before proceeding. ASSUMPTION: CCDC 14 standard practice provides a baseline framework.

---

### T-003: Daily Field Reports vs. Monthly Summary Only

**Option A — Daily field reports (captured by superintendent in shared system):**
- Pros: Real-time visibility; early issue detection; dispute documentation
- Cons: Administrative burden; potential report fatigue

**Option B — Monthly summary only:**
- Pros: Efficient; strategic-level focus
- Cons: Delays in issue identification and escalation

**Recommendation:** Both are required by RFP §7.3 (field reports AND monthly progress/control reports). Daily logs should be maintained internally; monthly reports are the Owner-facing communication vehicle. Aligns with RFP intent.

---

### T-004: Internal vs. Dual-Party Shop Drawing Review

**Option A — Internal only (Design-Builder engineer reviews for code/spec compliance):**
- Pros: Fast, efficient
- Cons: Potential for design-construction conflicts to be missed; conflict of interest concern

**Option B — Dual-party (Design-Builder engineer + Consultant Designer of Record both review):**
- Pros: Design intent preserved; OSR compliance confirmed
- Cons: Slower; adds coordination step

**Recommendation:** Dual-party review is the appropriate approach given the RFP §7.3 requirement to check compliance with both "approved working drawings" and "intent of the original design as per the OSR." This makes dual-party review substantively required, not merely recommended.

## Examples

### EX-001: RFI Processing Timeline

**Scenario:** Mechanical subcontractor submits an RFI requesting clarification on pipe routing through the apparatus bay floor slab.

| Step | Day | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Day 0 | Mechanical sub submits RFI via document management system with sketches and question |
| 2 | Day 1 | Superintendent reviews; classifies as design-interpretation RFI requiring Mechanical Consultant input |
| 3 | Day 1–2 | RFI forwarded to Mechanical Consultant with 3-business-day response request |
| 4 | Day 4 | Consultant responds with marked-up drawing and written clarification |
| 5 | Day 4 | Superintendent distributes response; contractor confirms and proceeds |

**Key point:** Clear category classification, published turnaround times, and documented escalation path.

---

### EX-002: Substantial Performance Consultant Inspection Protocol

**Scenario:** Project approaches substantial performance; consultant team inspections are required per RFP §7.3.

**Actions:**
1. Construction Manager notifies all discipline consultants (architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical) with minimum 10 business days' notice of substantial performance inspection date.
2. Each consultant performs independent site visit and reviews construction against their Construction Documents.
3. Each consultant issues a signed letter certifying that construction is in general conformance with their respective Construction Documents (or listing exceptions).
4. Letters are assembled by Construction Manager and delivered to Owner/Project Manager.
5. Any exceptions are entered into the deficiency tracking log for resolution.

**Key point:** This is a per-discipline obligation (not one letter); the narrative should specify which consultants are responsible.

---

### EX-003: Final Cleaning Pre-Occupancy Scope

Per RFP §7.3.1, final cleaning before final inspection includes removal of all of the following from inside and outside the facility:

| Item | Scope |
|---|---|
| Grease | All surfaces, floors, doors, hardware |
| Stains | Floors, walls, glazing |
| Labels | All adhesive labels removed from fixtures, glazing, equipment |
| Fingerprints | Glazing, stainless steel, painted surfaces |
| Dust and dirt | All horizontal surfaces, light fixtures, ventilation grilles |
| Foreign materials | Construction debris, packaging, offcuts |

**Key point:** The narrative should reference RFP §7.3.1 explicitly and commit to this scope — not a generic "broom-clean" standard.
