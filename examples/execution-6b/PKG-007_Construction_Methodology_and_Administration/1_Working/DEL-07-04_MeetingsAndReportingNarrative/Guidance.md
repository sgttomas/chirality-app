# Guidance: Meetings and Reporting Narrative

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-07-04
**Name:** Meetings and Reporting Narrative
**Package:** PKG-007 -- Construction Methodology & Administration
**Type:** Construction / Narrative
**Responsible Party:** PM / Construction Manager
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** INITIALIZED

---

## Purpose

The Meetings and Reporting Narrative demonstrates to the Town of Penhold that the Design-Builder has a clear, structured approach to project communication and transparent progress reporting throughout the construction phase. The narrative addresses RFP Section 7.3.5 and is evaluated as part of the Construction Methodology scoring criterion (OBJ-002: Project Delivery Plan -- 10 pts total; Construction Methodology sub-criterion = 3 pts per Decomposition §15).

**Scoring context:** The Construction Methodology sub-criterion is worth 3 pts out of the 10-pt Project Delivery Plan criterion (Decomposition SS15). This 3-pt sub-criterion is shared across five PKG-007 deliverables: DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology), DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration), DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach), DEL-07-04 (Meetings and Reporting), and DEL-07-05 (Quality Management). The RFP does not specify how the 3 pts are allocated among these five narratives. **TBD:** What distinguishes a high-scoring meetings/reporting narrative from a passing one is not explicitly stated; the presumption is that demonstrating structured, proactive, and complete coverage of RFP 7.3.5 requirements -- with credible implementation evidence (sample exhibits, schedule-based rationale) -- differentiates stronger submissions (Lensing F-002). The relative priority of DEL-07-04 within the PKG-007 suite should be considered in coordination with the other four narratives to ensure balanced coverage across the 3-pt sub-criterion (**ASSUMPTION** -- see Lensing D-002).

**Why this deliverable matters:**
- **Owner confidence:** A structured communication plan reduces ambiguity and gives the Owner -- represented operationally by the Project Committee (see Terminology Note below) -- visible control over project status.
- **Risk mitigation:** Regular progress reporting enables early identification of schedule risks and change order impacts before they escalate.
- **Accountability:** Documented meeting minutes create an audit trail of decisions and commitments throughout delivery.
- **Coordination:** Consistent standard agendas ensure all key topics are reliably addressed at each meeting.
- **Dispute prevention:** Transparent, frequent reporting reduces the likelihood of post-project disputes over delays, scope changes, and performance issues.

**Terminology Note -- "Owner" vs. "Project Committee" (Lensing B-003):** Throughout this deliverable suite, "Owner" refers to the Town of Penhold as the contracting party. The "Project Committee" (comprising Pendergast as Project Manager, Kowalchuk as Operations Manager, and Binnendyk as CAO -- per Decomposition SS5 Vocabulary Map) is the Owner's designated representative body for day-to-day project governance, including meeting attendance, minutes review, and decision-making during the construction phase. Where this document references interactions "with the Owner," it means interactions conducted through the Project Committee unless the context explicitly requires a broader municipal authority (e.g., Council approval). All four documents in this deliverable should use "Project Committee" when referring to meeting participants and "Owner" / "Town" only when referring to the contracting entity at large.

## Principles

### P-001: Regular, Structured Communication

Meetings must occur on a predictable, regular schedule with a consistent agenda structure. The Design-Builder is responsible for convening and chairing meetings with the Project Committee (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). A consistent meeting cadence gives the Owner reliable touchpoints and ensures issues surface promptly.

**Application:** Propose a specific meeting frequency in the narrative. Justify the choice based on the project schedule and activity levels at each phase.

---

### P-002: Preparation and Advance Notice

The 3-business-day advance agenda requirement (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22) exists to allow the Project Committee to prepare, research, and arrive ready for productive discussion. Well-prepared meetings shorten decision cycles and reduce the need for follow-up sessions.

**Application:** Develop and commit to a standard agenda template. The 3-business-day commitment is a contractual obligation and must be clearly stated in the narrative.

---

### P-003: Timely, Authoritative Documentation

Meeting minutes issued within 4 business days (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22) serve as the official record of what was discussed, decided, and assigned. The Project Manager reviews the draft and the Design-Builder makes required changes -- this ensures factual accuracy from both parties' perspectives.

**Application:** Commit explicitly to the 4-business-day timeline. Describe the review-and-correction process in the narrative. A sample minutes structure may be included as an optional exhibit to demonstrate organizational maturity.

---

### P-004: Transparency on Schedule and Milestone Progress

The RFP requires that an updated project schedule accompany each meeting agenda, showing progress against each milestone, slippage with explanations, and plans for schedule recovery (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). This is a specific and non-trivial requirement.

**Application:** Confirm this commitment explicitly in the narrative. Describe how slippage will be reported (explanation of cause, recovery actions, revised milestone dates). Note the coordination with DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule).

---

### P-005: Inclusive Participation

Subconsultants and subcontractors may call in via tele/videoconference as required; in-person attendance is not mandated for them (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). This preserves access to technical expertise without requiring unnecessary travel.

**Application:** Structure meetings to identify which agenda items require specific discipline input, and offer virtual participation for those who do not need to be present in person. Reserve in-person meetings for critical milestone decisions.

---

### P-006: Monthly Progress Reports as a Distinct Deliverable

Monthly progress reports are required throughout the construction phase (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). These are distinct from meeting minutes -- reports provide a formal written status record independent of any scheduled meeting.

**ASSUMPTION:** The specific content and format of monthly progress reports (e.g., whether they include cost tracking, photos, or safety metrics in addition to schedule and milestone information) is not detailed in RFP 7.3.5. The Design-Builder should propose a content framework in the narrative and note it is subject to Owner confirmation at contract award.

---

## Considerations

### C-001: Phase-Tailored Meeting Frequency

RFP 7.3.5 (p. 22) requires the Design-Builder to propose meeting frequency and duration "based on project schedule." A phased approach demonstrating awareness of different activity intensities is appropriate:

- **Design Phase:** More frequent (weekly or bi-weekly) to support timely design approval and coordination
- **Active Construction:** Typically weekly for full-activity periods; Design-Builder to justify in narrative
- **Closeout:** More frequent again to manage deficiency resolution and final inspections; then reduce post-occupancy

**Guidance:** Propose a phase-specific frequency table in the narrative. Justify each phase's cadence based on decision load and risk level. This demonstrates planning sophistication and schedule awareness.

**Schedule-grounded rationale (Lensing F-001):** The RFP requires the frequency proposal to be "based on project schedule" (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). Generic phase labels (e.g., "design," "construction," "closeout") are insufficient on their own; the narrative should reference specific milestone data from DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) to anchor each phase's proposed frequency. For example, if DEL-09-01 identifies a 3-month design development phase followed by a 9-month active construction phase, the narrative should tie the weekly cadence to the 9-month construction window and explain why weekly is appropriate given the activity density in that period. Where DEL-09-01 milestone data is not yet finalized, state the dependency explicitly and note frequency will be confirmed once the project schedule is baselined (**ASSUMPTION:** DEL-09-01 schedule data is available or will be available before proposal submission).

---

### C-002: Standard Agenda Content

The RFP requires a standard agenda covering progress, schedule, milestones, present challenges and issues, and proposed solutions (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). A comprehensive standard agenda could include:

| Agenda Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Safety and site status | Safety metrics, incidents, site conditions |
| Schedule performance | Progress against milestones, slippage, recovery plan |
| Budget and changes | Approved change orders, RFI status, budget tracking |
| Design issues and approvals | Outstanding clarifications, shop drawing review status |
| Quality and inspections | Inspection findings, non-conformances |
| Upcoming work and procurement | Next-phase activities, long-lead items |
| Action items review | Outstanding items from prior meetings |
| Other business | Ad hoc topics |

**ASSUMPTION:** Change order status and safety reporting are not explicitly listed in RFP 7.3.5's agenda content requirements but are standard construction administration agenda items and would be expected by a municipal owner. They should be included in the proposed agenda.

---

### C-003: Minutes Review and Correction Process

The RFP specifies that the Project Manager reviews the minutes and that any required changes are made by the Design-Builder (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). This implies a draft-review-finalize cycle that must fit within the 4-business-day window.

**Guidance:** A practical internal target of 2 business days for draft minutes submission to the Project Manager, with 2 business days for review and corrections, achieves the 4-business-day window. State this internal protocol in the narrative to show a credible implementation plan.

---

### C-004: Schedule Update Protocol

The requirement to issue an updated project schedule with each agenda (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22) means the schedule update must be prepared before the meeting -- not after. The schedule update must show:
1. Progress against each milestone
2. Any slippage, with explanations
3. Plans for schedule recovery

**Guidance:** Describe how the project schedule (from DEL-09-01) will be maintained and updated. Note that the schedule update serves as a proactive risk management tool, not just a reporting artifact.

---

### C-005: Close-Out Meetings

The RFP requires close-out meetings "as required for the completion of all close-out activities" (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). This is event-driven, not a fixed schedule.

**Guidance:** Describe the close-out meeting structure in the narrative. Common close-out meetings include: substantial performance walk-through, deficiency review meeting, and final acceptance meeting. Coordinate with DEL-08-01 (Commissioning/Closeout) and DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management) for alignment on what "close-out activities" entail.

---

### C-006: Differentiating Meeting Minutes from Monthly Progress Reports

Both meeting minutes and monthly progress reports are required (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). They serve different purposes:

- **Meeting minutes:** Specific record of one meeting -- attendees, decisions, action items, schedule update
- **Monthly progress report:** Formal written status document covering the full month -- schedule performance, budget status, key accomplishments, upcoming activities, issues log

**Guidance:** Explain both in the narrative. If meetings are weekly, the monthly report provides a management-level summary that the Owner can use for municipal reporting purposes.

---

### C-007: Proposal Commitments to Post-Award Obligations (Lensing E-001)

The meetings and reporting narrative is a proposal document: it states what the Design-Builder *intends* to do. Upon contract award, those stated intentions become contractual obligations enforceable under CCDC 14-2013 with Appendix J Supplementary Conditions. This transition has practical implications:

- **Language matters:** Use precise commitment language in the narrative (e.g., "will issue," "will chair") rather than aspirational language (e.g., "intends to," "plans to"). The RFP evaluators and subsequent contract administrators will interpret the narrative as binding commitments.
- **CCDC 14 integration:** The specific meeting and reporting obligations described in the narrative will operate within the broader CCDC 14 contract administration framework. Where the narrative establishes protocols (e.g., 3-day agenda lead time, 4-day minutes window), these should be understood as supplementing -- not contradicting -- CCDC 14 provisions. **ASSUMPTION:** Specific CCDC 14 clauses governing meeting and reporting obligations have not yet been located (see Lensing A-002); once identified, the narrative commitments should be confirmed as compatible.
- **Post-award handover:** The narrative approach should be transmissible to the operational construction management team. If the proposal team differs from the execution team, a briefing or handover step is needed to ensure the committed approach is actually implemented as described.

**TBD (Lensing E-002):** Confirm whether a formal post-award implementation briefing or handover procedure is needed to ensure the meetings/reporting approach described in the narrative is executed as committed. Procedure.md Records table lists "Post-award briefing materials" but no step currently produces them and no guidance explains the timing or format of this transition. This should be resolved with the PM before proposal finalization.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Meeting Frequency vs. Administrative Burden

**Trade-off:** More frequent meetings (e.g., weekly) maximize Owner visibility and speed issue resolution, but increase Design-Builder administrative overhead and may distract from active construction work.

| Frequency | Benefit | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly (active construction) | High transparency; fast issue resolution | Higher PM time commitment; scheduling complexity |
| Bi-weekly | Reduced overhead; still regular | Slower issue response; less Owner visibility |
| Monthly | Minimal overhead | Significant visibility gaps; risks compounding |

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** Weekly meetings during active construction and design phases represent the appropriate balance for a project of this scale and municipal owner profile. Transition to bi-weekly during lower-activity phases.

---

### T-002: In-Person vs. Virtual Participation

**Trade-off:** In-person meetings (in Town of Penhold) are higher-touch and build stronger working relationships, but require travel from potentially distributed team members. Virtual participation lowers barriers but may reduce decision-making effectiveness.

**Guidance:** The RFP explicitly names the Town of Penhold as the in-person meeting location (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). In-person should be the default for the Design-Builder's core team. Sub-consultants and sub-contractors may call in virtually as appropriate.

---

### T-003: Agenda Depth vs. Meeting Duration

**Trade-off:** A comprehensive agenda (8+ items) ensures thorough coverage but lengthens meetings. A streamlined agenda (4-5 items) is faster but may miss issues.

**Recommendation (ASSUMPTION):** A standard 6-8 item agenda with 90-minute target duration is appropriate for active construction phase progress meetings. Allow an "other business" slot for ad hoc items.

---

## Examples

### EX-001: Phased Meeting Frequency Proposal

A strong narrative approach proposes phase-specific frequency, demonstrating schedule-based thinking:

> "The Design-Builder proposes the following meeting schedule, based on anticipated project phasing and activity intensity:
> - Design Phase: Weekly meetings to coordinate design reviews, Owner approval cycles, and procurement strategy
> - Active Construction: Weekly progress meetings to maintain close coordination and timely issue resolution
> - Closeout: Weekly meetings during deficiency resolution and final inspections; reduce to as-needed following occupancy
>
> Meeting frequency may be adjusted by mutual agreement with the Project Committee if activity levels change significantly from projected."

**Why this works:** Demonstrates schedule awareness, flexibility, and Owner-centric thinking.

---

### EX-002: Standard Agenda Sample (Exhibit in Narrative)

A sample agenda table embedded in the narrative or as an exhibit demonstrates organizational maturity:

| No. | Agenda Item | Alloc. |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Safety and site status | 10 min |
| 2 | Schedule performance (vs. milestones; slippage; recovery) | 15 min |
| 3 | Budget and change orders | 10 min |
| 4 | Design issues and approvals | 15 min |
| 5 | Quality and inspections | 10 min |
| 6 | Upcoming work and procurement | 10 min |
| 7 | Action items review | 10 min |
| 8 | Other business | 10 min |
| | **Total** | **90 min** |

---

### EX-003: Schedule Update Slippage Narrative

A strong narrative excerpt demonstrates how slippage will be reported to the Owner:

> "For any milestone showing slippage, the updated project schedule will include: (1) the cause of delay, (2) the mitigation action being taken, (3) the revised milestone date, and (4) the impact on downstream milestones and overall project completion. Example: 'Foundation slab pour delayed 5 days due to extended cold weather. Mitigation: accelerated curing blankets and adjusted pour schedule. Revised: foundation complete by [date]. Impact: structure erection start delayed 3 days; no impact to overall project completion date due to float on this activity.'"

**Why this works:** Directly responds to the RFP's requirement for slippage explanations and recovery plans (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22), and demonstrates proactive risk management.

---

### EX-004: Close-Out Meeting Approach

A concise close-out meeting description demonstrates awareness of the full project lifecycle:

> "The Design-Builder will hold close-out meetings as required by project progress. These will include: (1) a substantial performance walk-through meeting to review construction completion and initiate the deficiency review process; (2) a formal deficiency review meeting with the Project Committee to confirm the consolidated deficiency list; and (3) a final acceptance meeting to confirm all deficiencies have been resolved and the project is ready for final payment. Additional close-out meetings will be convened as required for any complex outstanding items."
