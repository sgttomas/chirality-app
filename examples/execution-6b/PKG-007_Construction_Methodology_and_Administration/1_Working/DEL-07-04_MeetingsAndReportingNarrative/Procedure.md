# Procedure: Meetings and Reporting Narrative

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-07-04
**Name:** Meetings and Reporting Narrative
**Package:** PKG-007 -- Construction Methodology & Administration
**Type:** Construction / Narrative
**Responsible Party:** PM / Construction Manager
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** INITIALIZED

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps to produce the Meetings and Reporting Narrative proposal section (DEL-07-04) in response to RFP Section 7.3.5. The narrative must clearly demonstrate the Design-Builder's approach to project meetings and progress reporting throughout the construction phase, satisfying all explicit RFP 7.3.5 requirements and contributing to the Construction Methodology evaluation criterion (OBJ-002, 3 pts).

This procedure covers:
- Drafting the narrative section for proposal submission
- Development of supporting exhibits (optional but recommended)
- Integration with sibling PKG-007 narratives and DEL-09-01 (Schedule)
- Internal review and final formatting for proposal assembly

## Steps

### Step 1 -- Read and Extract RFP Requirements

**Action:**
1. Read RFP Section 7.3.5 (p. 22) in full and extract each explicit requirement.
2. Build a requirements checklist with the following items confirmed:
   - [ ] Design-Builder chairs and minutes meetings with Project Committee
   - [ ] Meetings may be in-person (Town of Penhold) or tele/video-conference
   - [ ] Design-Builder proposes meeting frequency and duration (based on project schedule)
   - [ ] Sub-consultants / sub-contractors call in via tele/videoconference as required
   - [ ] Design-Builder develops a standard agenda for all meetings
   - [ ] Agenda issued 3 business days before each meeting
   - [ ] Meeting minutes issued within 4 business days after each meeting
   - [ ] Minutes reviewed by Project Manager; changes made by Design-Builder
   - [ ] Progress meeting content: progress, schedule, milestones, present challenges, proposed solutions
   - [ ] Updated project schedule issued with each agenda (milestone progress, slippage, recovery plans)
   - [ ] Close-out meetings held as required for all close-out activities
   - [ ] Monthly progress reports provided
3. Note any ambiguities (e.g., monthly report content not specified -- flag as ASSUMPTION for narrative).

**Output:** Completed requirements checklist (internal reference document).
**Responsible:** PM / Construction Manager.

---

### Step 2 -- Develop Meeting Frequency and Phasing Proposal

**Action:**
1. Review DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) to understand:
   - Total project duration and major phase boundaries
   - Activity intensity at each phase (design, construction, closeout)
   - Decision-dense periods (design approval gates, critical construction milestones)
2. Propose a phase-based meeting frequency. Justify each phase's cadence in the narrative (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22 requires Design-Builder to propose frequency based on project schedule). Typical ASSUMPTION: weekly during active design and construction; adjusted at other phases.
3. Propose meeting duration (ASSUMPTION: 90 minutes for standard progress meetings; adjust for closeout or milestone-specific meetings).
4. Confirm primary format: in-person in Town of Penhold is the default for Design-Builder core team (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). Sub-consultants may participate via videoconference.

**Output:** Meeting frequency and phasing proposal (table or narrative).
**Responsible:** Construction Manager / PM.

---

### Step 3 -- Develop Standard Agenda Template

**Action:**
1. Design a standard agenda template addressing all required meeting content (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22): project progress, schedule, milestones, present challenges and issues, proposed solutions.
2. Add standard construction administration topics as appropriate (ASSUMPTION: safety status, change orders, upcoming work, action items review are expected by a municipal owner even if not explicitly listed in RFP 7.3.5).
3. Assign time allocations to confirm the agenda is feasible within the proposed meeting duration.
4. Prepare a sample agenda as an optional exhibit to embed in the narrative.

**Output:** Standard agenda template (for narrative description and optional exhibit).
**Responsible:** Construction Manager.

---

### Step 4 -- Develop Meeting Minutes and Review Protocol

**Action:**
1. Define the minutes structure: header (date/attendees/location), agenda item summaries with decisions highlighted, action item log (item number, description, responsible party, due date, status), and attachments list.
2. Define the internal timeline: ASSUMPTION: draft minutes completed within 2 business days of meeting; submitted to Project Manager for review; corrections and final distribution within 4 business days of meeting (meeting the RFP 7.3.5, p. 22 requirement).
3. Confirm the review-and-correction process: Project Manager reviews draft; Design-Builder makes required changes; final minutes distributed.
4. Optionally prepare a sample minutes structure as an exhibit.

5. Address escalation / recovery actions if timelines are missed (Lensing A-004): The narrative should describe what happens if the 3-business-day agenda issuance or 4-business-day minutes issuance timelines cannot be met (e.g., notification to the Project Committee, compressed review cycle, or next-meeting acknowledgment). **ASSUMPTION:** A brief escalation protocol (e.g., "If the 3-business-day agenda window cannot be met, the Design-Builder will notify the Project Committee immediately and issue the agenda no later than 1 business day before the meeting, with a verbal agenda summary provided in advance") strengthens the narrative by demonstrating contingency awareness.

**Output:** Minutes protocol description (for narrative); optional sample minutes exhibit.
**Responsible:** PM.

---

### Step 5 -- Develop Schedule Update and Monthly Report Approach

**Action:**
1. Define the schedule update format for agenda packages:
   - Shows progress against each milestone (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22)
   - Identifies any slippage with explanations (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22)
   - States plans for schedule recovery (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22)
   - References the master project schedule (DEL-09-01)
2. Define the monthly progress report content (ASSUMPTION -- RFP 7.3.5, p. 22 requires monthly reports but does not specify content): propose to include schedule performance summary, key accomplishments, upcoming activities, open issues and risks, and any change order status.
3. Clarify the distinction between meeting minutes and monthly progress reports in the narrative.

**Output:** Schedule update protocol and monthly report content framework (for narrative).
**Responsible:** PM / Scheduling lead.

---

### Step 6 -- Draft the Narrative

**Action:**
1. Organize the narrative to address all RFP 7.3.5 requirements in a logical sequence:
   - Meeting structure and format (in-person / virtual)
   - Meeting frequency and duration (phased proposal with rationale)
   - Standard agenda development (template description; reference exhibit)
   - Agenda issuance (3-business-day commitment)
   - Meeting minutes (4-business-day commitment; Project Manager review; correction process)
   - Progress reporting at meetings (all five required content elements)
   - Schedule update with agenda (milestone progress, slippage, recovery)
   - Monthly progress reports (content description)
   - Close-out meetings (event-driven; approach description -- see sub-step 2a below)
2. Include cross-references to related deliverables: DEL-07-02 (document management coordination), DEL-09-01 (schedule baseline).

**2a. Close-Out Meeting Narrative Content (Lensing C-002):** Develop a distinct sub-section within the narrative addressing close-out meeting preparation and execution. This should go beyond simply stating that close-out meetings will be held "as required" and should describe:
   - The types of close-out meetings anticipated (e.g., substantial performance walk-through, deficiency review, final acceptance -- see Guidance C-005 and EX-004)
   - How close-out meetings will be convened (trigger events, notice period, attendee list)
   - Agenda structure for close-out meetings (which may differ from the standard progress meeting agenda)
   - Coordination with DEL-08-01 (Commissioning/Closeout) and DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management) to ensure meeting outputs align with closeout workflow
   - Documentation requirements for close-out meetings (minutes, action items, sign-off records)

3. ASSUMPTION: Target narrative length of 2-4 pages plus optional exhibits. Use clear headings and tables for readability.

**Output:** Draft narrative section.
**Responsible:** Senior PM / Construction Manager.

### Step 7 -- Cross-Reference Review with Sibling Narratives

**Action:**
1. Confirm the following against completed sibling deliverables:

| Check | Sibling | What to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Meeting frequency aligns with project staffing | DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) | PM / CM team capacity supports proposed meeting cadence |
| Document control compatible | DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration) | Meeting minutes and report distribution align with document management protocols |
| Sub-consultant participation consistent | DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach) | Virtual participation approach matches subconsultant engagement strategy |
| Schedule milestone list referenced consistently | DEL-09-01 (Schedule) | Same milestones tracked in meeting schedule updates as in the master project schedule |

2. Resolve any inconsistencies before proceeding. Record unresolvable conflicts in Guidance.md Conflict Table.

**Output:** Cross-reference checklist (internal); any resolved inconsistencies documented.
**Responsible:** PM / Construction Manager.

---

### Step 8 -- Internal Review and Quality Check

**Action:**
1. Conduct internal review against this checklist:
   - [ ] All 12 Specification requirements (R-MR-01 through R-MR-12) addressed in the narrative?
   - [ ] Proposed meeting frequency justified with reference to project schedule?
   - [ ] 3-business-day agenda and 4-business-day minutes commitments explicitly stated?
   - [ ] Project Manager minutes review process described?
   - [ ] All five progress meeting content elements covered (progress, schedule, milestones, challenges, proposed solutions)?
   - [ ] Schedule update commitment explicit (milestone progress, slippage, recovery)?
   - [ ] Close-out meetings addressed?
   - [ ] Monthly progress reports confirmed with content description?
   - [ ] Consistent terminology throughout (Design-Builder, Project Committee, Town)?
   - [ ] Terminology consistent with other PKG-007 narratives?
   - [ ] All inferences and additions labeled ASSUMPTION?
2. Revise narrative based on review comments.
3. Obtain sign-off from Construction Manager and PM before submission to Proposal Manager.

**Output:** Reviewed and approved narrative; sign-off record.
**Responsible:** Construction Manager, Senior PM.

---

### Step 9 -- Format and Submit to Proposal Assembly

**Action:**
1. Format narrative to match proposal document template (font, headings, margins, headers/footers).
2. Confirm section placement: Section 7.3.5 of the proposal (Construction Phase and Administration -- Project Meetings and Reporting).
3. Attach any exhibits (agenda template, minutes sample) in the correct location.
4. Submit to Proposal Manager (DEL-01-02 -- Formal Submission Package assembly).
5. Archive: final narrative PDF, exhibits, review checklist, and requirements traceability record.

**Output:** Final formatted narrative (ready for proposal assembly).
**Responsible:** Proposal Manager, Construction Manager.

## Records

| Record | Description | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Meetings and Reporting Narrative (final) | Primary proposal artifact (DEL-07-04) | Proposal file; minimum 7 years post-project (**ASSUMPTION** -- Lensing D-001: the "7 years post-project" retention period is assumed based on standard professional liability and construction record-keeping practice; the specific source and authority for this period has not been confirmed from the RFP, CCDC 14, or municipal records bylaw -- **TBD: confirm retention period authority from contract or municipal policy**) |
| Exhibits (optional) | Sample agenda, minutes structure, schedule update, monthly report format | Proposal file |
| Requirements checklist | Internal traceability of RFP 7.3.5 requirements to narrative elements | Proposal file; post-award implementation reference |
| Cross-reference checklist | Verification of consistency with DEL-07-01, 07-02, 07-03, 09-01 | Proposal file |
| Review sign-off record | Internal approval record | Proposal file |
| Post-award briefing materials | If contract awarded: briefing to Construction Management team on committed meeting and reporting approach. **Note (Lensing E-002):** No step in this procedure currently produces these materials; a post-award handover step should be defined if the proposal team differs from the execution team -- see Guidance C-007 for transition considerations. **TBD: confirm whether a formal handover procedure is required.** | Project Execution Plan file |

## Notes

### Authoring Tips

1. **Lead with commitment, then detail:** State the RFP 7.3.5 requirements explicitly (agenda 3 days, minutes 4 days, monthly reports) at the top of the narrative section. Then describe how each commitment will be achieved. Evaluators scan for these specific values.
2. **Use a table or exhibit for the agenda template:** A visual agenda table is more persuasive than a paragraph description. It demonstrates that the Design-Builder has actually thought through meeting content rather than just acknowledging the requirement.
3. **Phase the frequency proposal:** Proposing a single frequency for the entire project reads as less sophisticated than a phased approach. Show awareness of project intensity variation.
4. **Tie the schedule update to DEL-09-01:** Referencing the project schedule (milestone list from the Detailed Project Schedule section) demonstrates integration between the meetings/reporting and schedule management approaches.
5. **Distinguish minutes from monthly reports:** Clearly differentiate the two in the narrative. Monthly reports are a management-level summary; meeting minutes are a transactional record of each session.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Missing the 3-day / 4-day timelines:** These are explicit RFP requirements. A narrative that describes the meeting approach without stating these exact timelines fails a key requirement check.
2. **Omitting the schedule update requirement:** The RFP requires an updated project schedule showing slippage and recovery to accompany each meeting agenda (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). This is easy to overlook; it must be stated explicitly.
3. **Treating close-out meetings as part of regular progress meetings:** Close-out meetings are separate and event-driven (RFP 7.3.5, p. 22). Address them as a distinct topic.
4. **Inconsistent terminology:** Use "Design-Builder," "Project Committee," and "Town" consistently. Inconsistent terminology in the narrative creates confusion and signals poor quality control.
5. **Overpromising:** Do not commit to unrealistically frequent meetings (e.g., 3x/week) or elaborate report formats unless the team can genuinely deliver them. Evaluators may ask clarifying questions or hold the proposal to its stated commitments.
