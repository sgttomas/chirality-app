# Warranty Requirements Narrative — Specification

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-08-03
**Package:** PKG-008 (Commissioning, Closeout & Warranty)

---

## Scope

### What is Covered

This deliverable specifies the Design-Builder's warranty obligations and approach for the Penhold Public Services Building (Design-Build delivery). The warranty narrative must:

1. **Describe the 12-month base warranty** covering all labour and materials from the date of occupancy permit issuance (RFP §7.6).
2. **Explain Supplementary Condition enhancements** (SC54–SC55) that modify the CCDC 14-2013 contract form's standard GC 12.5 warranty terms.
3. **Define the scope of defect coverage** including what constitutes a defect versus excluded conditions (normal wear and tear, misuse, inadequate maintenance, accident).
4. **Address Design-Builder obligations** including investigation costs, repair timelines, and remediation standards.
5. **Clarify manufacturer warranty handover** and integration with the Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Manual.
6. **Present the Owner's rights and remedies**, including exhaustive inspection rights, notice requirements, and overtime work scheduling.

### What is NOT Covered

- Specific individual manufacturer warranty terms (these appear in the O&M Manual, produced under DEL-08-01).
- Post-warranty maintenance or extended coverage options.
- Detailed warranty claims procedure (primarily addressed in DEL-08-01, Commissioning Narrative).
- Warranty bond or insurance cost pricing (covered in PKG-001 pricing deliverables).
- Commissioning program or training delivery (covered by DEL-08-01).
- Deficiency identification and resolution during construction punch-out (covered by DEL-08-02).

## Requirements

### R-01: Base Warranty Term and Scope
**Requirement:** The narrative must clearly state that the Design-Builder will provide a twelve (12) month all-inclusive (labour and materials) warranty on all materials and workmanship, effective from the date the occupancy permit is issued.

**Source:** RFP §7.6, first bullet, page 25 — "Twelve (12) month all-inclusive (labour & materials) warranty on all materials and workmanship from the date the occupancy permit is issued."
**Verification:** Narrative includes explicit statement of 12-month period, coverage scope (labour and materials), and trigger event (date of occupancy permit issuance). All three elements must be present.

---

### R-02: Defect Definition — Exclusions (SC54, adds to CCDC 14 GC 12.5.4)
**Requirement:** The narrative must incorporate SC54's enhanced defect definition preamble. Specifically, the term "defect" shall not be construed as embracing such imperfections as would naturally follow misuse, failure to perform recommended maintenance, accident, or the wear and tear of normal use.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC54 (adds to end of CCDC 14-2013 GC 12.5.4 — preamble), page 71
**Verification:** Narrative explicitly states all four categories of conditions excluded from the defect definition, consistent with SC54 preamble language.

---

### R-03: Manufactured Item Performance Standard (SC54, GC 12.5.4.1)
**Requirement:** The narrative must state that any manufactured item or material, when used as directed, shall be capable of such use for the duration of the specified warranty period. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered being a "defect."

**Source:** Appendix J, SC54 (GC 12.5.4.1), page 71 — verbatim: "Any manufactured item or material, which when used as directed, shall be capable of such use for the duration of the specified warranty period. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered as being a 'defect'."
**Verification:** Narrative includes the "used as directed / capable for warranty period / failure = defect" standard and confirms that failure constitutes a defect.

---

### R-04: Investigation and Repair Cost Allocation (SC54, GC 12.5.4.2)
**Requirement:** The narrative must make clear that the costs of investigations, tests, repairs and/or replacement, and the making good of any resulting damage, shall be borne by the Design-Builder. The Design-Builder is responsible for ensuring that all required, corrective, remedial, or replacement Work is performed without undue delay.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC54 (GC 12.5.4.2), page 71 — verbatim: "The costs of investigations, tests, repairs and/or replacement and the making good of any resulting damage shall be borne by the Design-Builder. The Design-Builder shall be responsible for ensuring that all required, corrective, remedial or replacement Work is performed without undue delay."
**Verification:** Narrative explicitly assigns all investigation and repair cost responsibility to the Design-Builder, including making good resulting damage; does not split or condition this allocation.

---

### R-05: Warranty Work Scheduling and Overtime (SC54, GC 12.5.4.3)
**Requirement:** The narrative must state that all corrective, remedial, or replacement Work shall be executed at such times as shall be convenient for the Owner, which may entail overtime Work on the part of the Design-Builder. The Owner shall give notice of observed defects promptly. Additional charges for overtime Work, prior to the expiry of the warranty, shall be borne by the Design-Builder.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC54 (GC 12.5.4.3), page 71
**Verification:** Narrative addresses Owner-convenience scheduling, overtime cost allocation to Design-Builder, and the Owner's prompt-notice obligation. All three sub-elements addressed.

---

### R-06: Owner Exhaustive Inspection Right (SC54, GC 12.5.4.3 and .4)
**Requirement:** The narrative must describe the Owner's right to carry out a detailed and exhaustive inspection of the Project with regard to all Work carried out under the Contract. The Design-Builder shall be required to make good, correct, repair, or replace the defective or unsatisfactory materials and/or workmanship such inspection shall have disclosed.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC54 (GC 12.5.4.3 — inspection right stated within; GC 12.5.4.4 — remedy obligation continuation), pages 71–72
**Verification:** Narrative grants the Owner this inspection right and states the Design-Builder's obligation to remedy everything disclosed by such inspection.

---

### R-07: Excessive Servicing Provision (SC55, adds GC 12.5.9)
**Requirement:** The narrative must address SC55's addition of GC 12.5.9, which states that any material or equipment requiring excessive servicing during the warranty period (or free maintenance period, if applicable) shall be considered defective, and the warranty (or free maintenance period) shall be deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC55 (adds GC 12.5.9), page 72 — verbatim: "Any material or equipment requiring excessive servicing during the warranty period (or free maintenance period if applicable) shall be considered defective and the warranty (or free maintenance period) shall be deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected."
**Verification:** Narrative includes (a) the excessive servicing = defective rule, and (b) the "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" mechanism. If "excessive servicing" thresholds are not defined, narrative flags this as requiring clarification (see CON-01 in Guidance.md Conflict Table).

**Note on source language:** The source uses "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected." This is more precise than "restarts" — the warranty is not simply re-started but is treated as if it commenced fresh at the correction date.

---

### R-08: Repair Commencement Timeline and Standard (SC55, adds GC 12.5.10)
**Requirement:** The narrative must state that the Design-Builder shall make good in a permanent manner, satisfactory to the Owner, any and all damage to the Work during the period of warranty. The Design-Builder shall commence repairs on any Work identified as defective within twenty (20) working days of receipt of notice from the Owner.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC55 (adds GC 12.5.10), page 72 — verbatim: "The Design-Builder shall make good in a permanent manner, satisfactory to the Owner, any and all damage to the Work during the period of warranty as aforesaid. The Design-Builder shall commence repairs on any Work identified as defective within twenty (20) working days of receipt of notice from the Owner."
**Verification:** Narrative explicitly cites the "twenty (20) working days" commencement requirement, confirms repairs must be permanent and satisfactory to the Owner, and includes making good all damage to the Work during the warranty period.

---

### R-08a: Voluntary Tiered Response Enhancement (if adopted)
**Requirement:** If the narrative commits to a tiered response time framework (e.g., immediate for safety-critical, 10 working days for priority, 20 working days for routine per Procedure Step 3.9 and Guidance T-002), the narrative must clearly distinguish this commitment as a **voluntary enhancement** beyond the GC 12.5.10 minimum floor of twenty (20) working days. The narrative must not inadvertently create binding obligations beyond SC55 without acknowledging that such commitments exceed the minimum contractual requirement.

**Source:** Appendix J, SC55 (GC 12.5.10), page 72 — establishes the 20-working-day floor; Guidance T-002 proposes tiered response as a voluntary differentiator; Procedure Step 3.9 drafts the tiered commitment language
**Verification:** If tiered response times appear in the narrative, verify that the text labels them as voluntary enhancements and confirms the GC 12.5.10 twenty (20) working day maximum as the contractual floor.

**Note:** This requirement applies only if the final narrative adopts the tiered approach recommended in Guidance T-002. If the narrative uses the 20-working-day floor only, R-08 is sufficient. *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing A-001)*

---

### R-09: Manufacturer Warranty Integration
**Requirement:** The narrative must clarify that all other warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers (for example, roofing, flooring, appliances, equipment, etc.) will be provided in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manual and assigned to the Owner.

**Source:** RFP §7.6, second bullet, page 25 — verbatim: "All other warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, for example roofing, flooring, appliances, equipment, etc. will be provided in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manual and assigned to the Owner."
**Verification:** Narrative explicitly states manufacturer warranty collection, O&M Manual inclusion, and assignment to Owner. All three elements present.

**R-09a: Warranty Summary Schedule Format (recommended)**
The narrative should reference that manufacturer warranties will be compiled in the O&M Manual in a structured warranty summary schedule format containing: product/system name, manufacturer name, warranty period start/end dates, manufacturer contact information, and claim procedure. This schedule format ensures the Owner has a single reference document for all warranty coverage. *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing X-001; Guidance.md C-004)*
**Verification:** Narrative references a warranty summary schedule with the five required fields (product/system, manufacturer, period, contact, claim procedure), or references Guidance C-004 as the format specification.

---

### R-10: Narrative Format and Proposal Integration
**Requirement:** The warranty narrative must be written as a standalone section suitable for direct incorporation into the formal proposal response (Part 7, Delivery Plan). It must use professional language appropriate for proposal evaluation and cross-reference related deliverables (DEL-08-01 and DEL-08-02) where relevant. The proposal must present information in the order of Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 (RFP §4.3 / constraint C-02).

**Source:** RFP §4.3 (proposal structure, page 10); RFP §7.6 (narrative requirement, page 25); Hard Constraint C-02 (Decomposition §3)
**Verification:** Narrative reads coherently and professionally; is correctly positioned for proposal Part 7; integrates with other PKG-008 deliverables; adheres to proposal structure requirements.

### Supporting Documents (External, not produced by this deliverable)

- **RFP §7.6:** Warranty Requirements — normative source
- **Appendix J (SC54–SC55):** Supplementary Conditions to CCDC 14-2013 — normative source
- **O&M Manual** (context from DEL-08-01): Manufacturer warranty assignments
- **Commissioning Narrative (DEL-08-01):** Warranty handover and O&M context
- **Deficiencies Management Narrative (DEL-08-02):** Deficiency-to-warranty period transition

## Notes and Assumptions

**ASSUMPTION:** "Excessive servicing" (SC55, GC 12.5.9) is not numerically or procedurally defined in the RFP or Supplementary Conditions. The narrative should flag this as requiring Owner/Design-Builder agreement at contract kickoff, or propose a definition by reference to O&M Manual maintenance schedules.

**ASSUMPTION:** The twenty (20) working day timeline in SC55 (GC 12.5.10) refers to standard construction industry "working days" (excluding weekends and statutory holidays in Alberta); no conversion to calendar days is implied.

**NOTE:** SC54 and SC55 amend CCDC 14-2013 General Conditions as follows:
- SC54 = adds to end of GC 12.5.4, introducing a preamble (defect exclusions) and sub-clauses .1 through .4 (manufactured item standard, investigation costs, overtime/scheduling/inspection right, remedy obligation)
- SC55 = adds new GC 12.5.9 (excessive servicing = defective; warranty deemed to take effect from correction date) and GC 12.5.10 (permanent repairs within twenty working days)

**NOTE:** GC 12.5.10 source language uses "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" for the warranty restart mechanism (GC 12.5.9). This precise formulation is legally significant and must be reflected accurately in the narrative.

**TBD (A-002):** The full text of CCDC 14-2013 GC 12.5 (base warranty article) has not been directly reviewed. SC54-SC55 modify GC 12.5.4 and add GC 12.5.9 and GC 12.5.10, but the remaining base GC 12.5 provisions (e.g., GC 12.5.1 through GC 12.5.3, GC 12.5.5 through GC 12.5.8) have not been confirmed. Obtain or summarize the CCDC 14-2013 GC 12.5 base text to verify that SC54-SC55 modifications are complete and no additional base warranty obligations are inadvertently omitted from this narrative. *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing A-002)*
