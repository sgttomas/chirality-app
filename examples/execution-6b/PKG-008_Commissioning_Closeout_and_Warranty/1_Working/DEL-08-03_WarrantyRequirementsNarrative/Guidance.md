# Warranty Requirements Narrative — Guidance

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-08-03
**Package:** PKG-008 (Commissioning, Closeout & Warranty)

---

## Purpose

The Warranty Requirements Narrative serves to:

1. **Communicate the Design-Builder's warranty commitment** clearly to the Owner and evaluation committee, demonstrating understanding of the warranty obligations under CCDC 14-2013 GC 12.5 as enhanced by Supplementary Conditions SC54–SC55.
2. **Contribute to Project Delivery Plan scoring** (OBJ-002): A well-articulated warranty approach demonstrates professional competence in risk management and Owner protection, supporting the 2-point sub-criterion for "Commissioning, Training, Closeout Procedures" shared across PKG-008 (RFP §8.2, page 26).
3. **Provide transparency on cost assumptions** regarding warranty execution (investigation, repair, overtime work), so the Owner understands the Design-Builder's approach to warranty cost distribution.
4. **Establish a shared understanding** between Design-Builder and Owner on what constitutes a defect, repair timelines, and remedy procedures, reducing the risk of post-award disputes.
5. **Bridge commissioning to operational warranty** by coordinating with DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Narrative) and DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management Narrative) to present a coherent closeout and protection strategy.

## Principles

### P-001: Accuracy to SC Source Language
Use the precise language from SC54 and SC55 when describing critical provisions. In particular:
- SC54 defect exclusions: "misuse, failure to perform recommended maintenance, accident, or the wear and tear of normal use" (not "normal wear and tear").
- SC54 GC 12.5.4.2: costs borne by Design-Builder "without undue delay" (not merely "promptly").
- SC55 GC 12.5.9 warranty restart: "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" (not simply "restarts"). This formulation is legally meaningful — the warranty is treated as having never run during the period of the uncorrected defect.
- SC55 GC 12.5.10: "twenty (20) working days" — use the parenthetical number form as in the source.

### P-002: Clarity Over Contract Language
Do not reproduce raw contract clauses verbatim throughout the narrative — paraphrase and explain in plain language. However, cite the GC sub-clause numbers (e.g., "per GC 12.5.4.2") so evaluation reviewers can verify compliance. Explicitly state what is covered (labour, materials, investigation, consequential damage) and what is not (normal wear and tear, misuse, inadequate maintenance, accidents).

### P-003: Acknowledge and Embrace the Supplementary Conditions
SC54 and SC55 represent deliberate Owner enhancements to standard CCDC 14-2013 warranty terms. These enhancements shift investigation cost and schedule risk toward the Design-Builder. The narrative should not minimize or hedge these obligations; instead, acknowledge them as reasonable protections for a public facility with long-term municipal stewardship requirements.

### P-004: Frame from the Owner's Perspective
Frame the warranty approach around what assurances the Owner receives: who pays for investigation, who bears overtime, who has the right to inspect, and how long the Owner is protected. This framing is more persuasive for proposal evaluation than a purely Design-Builder-centric presentation.

### P-005: Operational Practicality for an Active Public Facility
The Penhold PSB is a critical public services building (Fire Hall + Public Works operations). The facility will be occupied and fully operational during the 12-month warranty period. The narrative must acknowledge this reality and explain how warranty work will be executed without disrupting emergency response capability or municipal operations.

### P-006: Two-Tier Warranty Structure
Clearly distinguish the Design-Builder's 12-month warranty (labour, materials, workmanship) from manufacturer warranties (product longevity, typically 1–20+ years). Explain how both tiers are provided to the Owner and where each is documented (O&M Manual per RFP §7.6).

### P-007: Warranty Quality Begins at Commissioning
The best warranty strategy is one rarely invoked. Strong commissioning (DEL-08-01), thorough deficiency resolution (DEL-08-02), and complete O&M training reduce post-occupancy warranty call-outs. The narrative should explicitly connect warranty quality to upfront commissioning quality.

## Considerations

### C-001: Defect Definition Nuance
**Context:** SC54 excludes normal wear and tear, misuse, and inadequate maintenance from defect coverage. However, "normal wear" and "adequate maintenance" can be subjective in practice.

**Guidance:** The narrative should:
- Acknowledge that SC55 GC 12.5.9 provides a functional test: equipment requiring excessive servicing during the warranty period is deemed defective regardless of other arguments.
- Recommend that the Owner and Design-Builder agree at contract kickoff on maintenance interval standards for major systems (HVAC, roofing, plumbing, electrical), and that these be documented in the O&M Manual.
- Propose that deviations from documented maintenance intervals may be a factor in determining whether the wear-and-tear exclusion applies.

**Risk:** Ambiguity on the defect/wear boundary can lead to disputes at months 10–12 of the warranty period when early failures emerge.

**Cross-reference:** CON-01 in Conflict Table below.

### C-002: Investigation Cost Allocation
**Context:** SC54 GC 12.5.4.2 places all investigation costs on the Design-Builder, including making good resulting damage, performed "without undue delay." This is a significant departure from a standard CCDC 14-2013 position and represents material financial exposure.

**Guidance:** The narrative should:
- Acknowledge this cost allocation clearly and without qualification.
- Explain how the Design-Builder will manage investigation efficiency: rapid response, qualified technicians (subcontractor retention agreements), and thorough documentation to minimize repeated investigations.
- Note that investigation costs are minimized when the facility is constructed to code, properly commissioned (DEL-08-01), and deficiencies fully resolved before occupancy (DEL-08-02).

**Rationale:** Demonstrating awareness of this obligation — and explaining how upfront quality reduces its exposure — is a positive signal to the evaluation committee.

### C-003: Occupied-Building Warranty Execution
**Context:** SC54 GC 12.5.4.3 requires that warranty work be executed at times convenient for the Owner, which may include evenings, weekends, and statutory holidays (overtime work). The Design-Builder bears these overtime costs.

**Guidance:** The narrative should:
- Acknowledge that the Penhold PSB houses active emergency services and municipal operations.
- Explain that the Design-Builder will maintain a designated warranty coordinator with 24/7 contact availability for emergency defect notifications.
- Describe a triage process: safety-critical defects (e.g., structural, fire suppression, emergency generator, apparatus bay doors) are prioritized for immediate response; minor defects are scheduled at Owner convenience.

**Risk Mitigation:** Strong commissioning and O&M training (DEL-08-01) reduce warranty call-outs and help the Owner manage minor issues independently.

### C-004: Manufacturer Warranty Coordination
**Context:** The Design-Builder assigns manufacturer warranties to the Owner (RFP §7.6), creating a multi-party warranty landscape. For major building systems (roofing, HVAC, generators, overhead doors), manufacturer warranties may run 5–20+ years.

**Guidance:** The narrative should:
- Confirm that all manufacturer warranties and guarantee certificates will be collected prior to substantial performance.
- State that these will be compiled in the O&M Manual with contact information, warranty periods, and claim procedures for each manufacturer.
- Recommend including a warranty summary schedule in the O&M Manual: product/system, manufacturer name, warranty period start/end, contact information, and claim procedure.
- Clarify that the Design-Builder's 12-month warranty applies to workmanship and materials; manufacturer warranties cover product performance for extended periods.

**Owner Benefit:** The Owner receives dual protection — short-term workmanship coverage from the Design-Builder and long-term product coverage from manufacturers.

### C-005: Warranty Start Timing vs. Commissioning Completion
**Context:** The warranty period starts from the date the occupancy permit is issued (RFP §7.6), not from the date of substantial completion or commissioning handoff. The occupancy permit is a regulatory event (issued by the Authority Having Jurisdiction), not a Design-Builder or Owner unilateral decision.

**Guidance:** The narrative should:
- Explain this distinction clearly.
- Commit that commissioning will be completed and all deficiencies resolved before occupancy permit issuance — so the facility is in a defect-free state when the warranty clock starts.
- Identify the risk: if the Owner delays occupancy permit application after commissioning completion, interim maintenance responsibility is undefined. Flag as CON-02 (Conflict Table).

**Cross-reference:** DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Narrative) governs the sequence from commissioning completion to occupancy permit to warranty activation.

### C-006a: GC 12.5.4.3 vs GC 12.5.4.4 Distinction (Vocabulary Clarification)
**Context:** SC54 adds four sub-clauses to GC 12.5.4. Sub-clauses .3 and .4 are sometimes cited together (e.g., Specification R-06 references "GC 12.5.4.3 and .4"), but they serve distinct purposes that should be clearly distinguished in the narrative.

**Guidance:**
- **GC 12.5.4.3** covers three topics: (a) warranty work executed at times convenient for the Owner (which may entail overtime at Design-Builder cost prior to warranty expiry), (b) the Owner's obligation to give notice of observed defects promptly, and (c) the Owner's right to carry out a detailed and exhaustive inspection of the Project with regard to all Work.
- **GC 12.5.4.4** covers the Design-Builder's **remedy obligation continuation**: specifically, the Design-Builder must make good, correct, repair, or replace all defective or unsatisfactory materials and/or workmanship that such inspection (under GC 12.5.4.3) shall have disclosed.

In summary: GC 12.5.4.3 establishes the Owner's **inspection right** (and scheduling/notice framework); GC 12.5.4.4 establishes the Design-Builder's **obligation to act** on everything the inspection reveals. The narrative should present these as a connected pair: the Owner inspects (per .3) and the Design-Builder remedies everything found (per .4).

### C-006: Warranty Period Review (Deficiency Alignment)
**Context:** DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management) describes a 12-month warranty period review process. Deficiencies found during the warranty period must transition cleanly to the SC55 repair framework (GC 12.5.10: twenty working day commencement, permanent repairs).

**Guidance:** The narrative should briefly note that warranty defects identified during the 12-month period will be tracked and resolved per the GC 12.5.10 framework. This signals continuity between deficiency management and warranty administration.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Investigation Cost Allocation
**Option A (RFP / SC54 position — Owner-favourable):** Design-Builder bears all investigation, testing, repair, replacement, and resulting damage costs (GC 12.5.4.2). The Owner submits notice; the Design-Builder responds at its own expense "without undue delay."

**Option B (Balanced):** Design-Builder bears investigation costs for defects found within the first 90 days; costs shared thereafter.

**Option C (Design-Builder-favourable):** Owner and Design-Builder share investigation costs; Design-Builder responsible only for confirmed construction errors.

**RFP Position:** SC54 GC 12.5.4.2 mandates Option A. No deviation is available.
**Implication:** This is a significant cost allocation favouring the Owner. The Design-Builder must price warranty risk into the contract price and must invest in commissioning quality to minimize exposure.

---

### T-002: Repair Commencement Timeline
**Option A (Tighter than RFP):** Commence all warranty repairs within 10 working days; safety-critical repairs within 24 hours.

**Option B (RFP position — minimum floor):** Commence all repairs within twenty (20) working days of Owner notice; scheduling at Owner convenience (SC55 GC 12.5.10).

**Option C (Flexible — not available):** No fixed commencement deadline; repairs scheduled by mutual agreement.

**RFP Position:** SC55 GC 12.5.10 mandates Option B as a minimum floor. The Design-Builder may commit to faster tiered response (e.g., safety-critical: immediate; priority: 10 working days; routine: 20 working days) to strengthen the proposal. The Design-Builder may not exceed the 20-working-day maximum.
**Implication:** Offering a tiered response time commitment is a positive differentiator while staying compliant with GC 12.5.10.

---

### T-003: Warranty Scope Breadth
**Option A (Two-tier / RFP position):** Design-Builder 12-month warranty covers labour and materials. Manufacturer warranties cover product performance for their specified durations. Both tiers provided to Owner (RFP §7.6).

**Option B (Extended DB warranty):** Design-Builder voluntarily extends its workmanship warranty beyond 12 months for specific high-risk systems (e.g., roofing membrane, structural connections).

**Option C (DB-favourable — not available):** Design-Builder warranty covers only construction defects; all manufacturer product failures are Owner's sole recourse against manufacturers.

**RFP Position:** RFP §7.6 specifies Option A as the minimum. Option B is a voluntary enhancement that may improve evaluation scores. Option C is not available — SC54 GC 12.5.4.2 makes the Design-Builder responsible for the full defect investigation and remediation cost regardless of root cause.

## Examples

### EX-001: Defect vs. Normal Wear — HVAC Compressor
**Scenario:** At month 8 of the warranty, the main apparatus bay HVAC compressor fails.

**Analysis (per SC54):**
- HVAC compressors in commercial/institutional applications typically operate 10–20 years before failure.
- Failure at 8 months (less than 2 years of operation) is not consistent with "the wear and tear of normal use" (SC54 preamble).
- If the Owner followed recommended maintenance (per O&M Manual), usage was appropriate.
- **Conclusion:** This is a defect. The Design-Builder investigates at Design-Builder cost (GC 12.5.4.2), determines root cause (manufacturing defect, installation error, or design failure), and repairs or replaces without undue delay. Manufacturer warranty may also apply if the failure traces to a manufacturing defect in the compressor unit.
- Repair commences within twenty (20) working days of Owner notice (GC 12.5.10).

---

### EX-002: Excessive Servicing Trigger — Plumbing System
**Scenario:** The apparatus bay plumbing system requires service calls at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 11 to fix recurrent drain blockages and slow drainage.

**Analysis (per SC55 GC 12.5.9):**
- The drainage system was not misused; the issue is a latent installation defect (inadequate slope, incorrect drain sizing, or construction debris).
- The frequency of service calls constitutes "excessive servicing."
- **Conclusion:** The drain system (or relevant component) is deemed defective. The warranty is "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" — giving the Owner a fresh warranty period from the root-cause repair date.

---

### EX-003: Occupied-Building Emergency — Apparatus Bay Overhead Door
**Scenario:** At month 3, an apparatus bay overhead door motor fails at 02:00 on a Saturday, preventing Fire Department apparatus from leaving the bay.

**Analysis (per SC54 GC 12.5.4.3):**
- The facility is an active Fire Hall. A blocked apparatus bay door is a safety-critical emergency.
- The Owner provides immediate notice (by phone and written follow-up).
- Design-Builder's designated warranty coordinator dispatches a certified overhead door technician. Overtime charges apply.
- **Conclusion:** Design-Builder bears overtime and emergency call-out costs. The facility's operational continuity is maintained. If the door motor fails again within the warranty period, SC55 GC 12.5.9 excessive servicing provision may apply and the warranty would be deemed to take effect from the correction date.

---

### EX-004: Manufacturer Warranty Integration — EPDM Roofing Membrane
**Scenario:** At month 7, the EPDM roof membrane begins to separate at a flashing detail.

**Analysis:**
- The Design-Builder's 12-month warranty applies: Design-Builder investigates (at Design-Builder cost per GC 12.5.4.2) and determines whether the separation is a workmanship defect or a product manufacturing defect.
- The roofing membrane manufacturer's warranty (typically 10–20 years for EPDM) may also apply.
- If workmanship defect: Design-Builder repairs at own cost; manufacturer warranty continues for remaining product life.
- If product defect: Design-Builder arranges the repair and may pursue manufacturer warranty as recourse. The Design-Builder remains the Owner's single point of contact; Owner is not responsible for pursuing the manufacturer directly during the 12-month warranty period.
- **Conclusion:** From the Owner's perspective, the Design-Builder is the single point of accountability for all defects during the 12-month warranty period, regardless of root cause. Manufacturer warranty recovery is between the Design-Builder and the manufacturer.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CON-01** | "Excessive servicing" (GC 12.5.9) is not defined numerically or procedurally — what frequency or pattern of service calls triggers this provision? | SC55 (adds GC 12.5.9), Appendix J page 72 | No definition in RFP body or other SC clauses | Specification R-07; Procedure Steps 2–3; Guidance C-001 | Propose definition in O&M Manual maintenance schedule (agreed at contract kickoff between Owner and Design-Builder); deviations from scheduled maintenance intervals may be a triggering factor | TBD |
| **CON-02** | Warranty clock starts at occupancy permit issuance (RFP §7.6). If the occupancy permit is delayed (whether by Owner or AHJ) after commissioning completes, who is responsible for maintaining the facility defect-free during that interim period? | RFP §7.6 (warranty from permit date, page 25) | RFP §7.5 (substantial performance prerequisites list, page 24) | Datasheet Conditions; Specification R-01; Procedure Prerequisites | RFP §7.6 governs warranty start; interim responsibility requires explicit contractual clarification; recommend sequencing agreement in DEL-08-01 Commissioning Narrative. The prudent assumption is that the Design-Builder **maintains** the facility during the interim period, meaning: (a) routine maintenance of all building systems per O&M Manual schedules (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, building envelope), (b) defect repairs for any deficiencies identified during or after commissioning, and (c) emergency response for safety-critical failures (structural, fire suppression, apparatus bay doors, emergency power). This interim maintenance does **not** include Owner-caused damage, third-party interference, or modifications requested by the Owner outside the original scope. *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing D-001; Guidance C-005)* | TBD |

## Notes

- **Related Deliverables:** DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Narrative) provides the warranty handover context (O&M Manual delivery, staff training, system commissioning). DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management) handles the punch list and deficiency resolution process that precedes warranty activation.
- **Scoring Context:** This narrative contributes to the 2-point "Commissioning, Training, Closeout Procedures" sub-criterion shared across PKG-008 (DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, DEL-08-03) within OBJ-002 (Project Delivery Plan). A clear, Owner-protective warranty narrative that demonstrates precise understanding of SC54–SC55 GC sub-clause language will score above a generic warranty statement.
- **Scoring Weight Allocation Guidance (ASSUMPTION):** The 2-point sub-criterion is shared across DEL-08-01 (Commissioning, Training, Closeout), DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management), and DEL-08-03 (Warranty Requirements). The RFP does not specify how these points are weighted across the three deliverables. **Recommended approach:** DEL-08-01 (Commissioning) likely carries the heaviest weight because it covers the broadest scope (commissioning program, O&M training, closeout procedures); DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies) bridges construction to operations; DEL-08-03 (Warranty) is the most narrowly scoped. For the warranty narrative, prioritize **compliance precision** (exact SC54-SC55 language, clause-level specificity) and **Owner-protective framing** over narrative length. A concise, technically precise warranty narrative (400-600 words) that demonstrates mastery of the Supplementary Conditions is more valuable than an extended but generic treatment. The key differentiator is showing that the Design-Builder has read and understood each GC sub-clause, not merely summarized the RFP bullets. *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing F-001)*
- **Vocabulary Note (Review Authorities):** The Procedure (Prerequisites and Step 8) identifies **Quality Lead** and **Legal / Contract Advisor** as required reviewers and approval authorities for this narrative, in addition to the PM (Responsible Party per _CONTEXT.md). These roles are the designated internal review authorities for all warranty-related content. The Quality Lead verifies compliance completeness; the Legal / Contract Advisor verifies that contractual language accurately reflects SC54-SC55 obligations without inadvertently creating additional binding commitments. *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing F-002)*
- **ASSUMPTION:** The narrative assumes that occupancy permit issuance is a clear, identifiable event and that commissioning and deficiency resolution are completed on schedule such that the permit is not delayed by Design-Builder default.
- **ASSUMPTION:** "Working days" in SC55 GC 12.5.10 means calendar days excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and statutory holidays in Alberta — standard construction industry interpretation. The source text uses parenthetical "(20)" which is the notation used in CCDC contract documents for clarity.
