## Steps

### Step 1 — Review Source Requirements

**Action:**
1. Read RFP §7.6 in full (page 25). Note the two main warranty bullets:
   - Twelve (12) month all-inclusive (labour and materials) warranty on all materials and workmanship from the date the occupancy permit is issued.
   - All other warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers (roofing, flooring, appliances, equipment, etc.) provided in O&M Manual and assigned to the Owner.
2. Read Appendix J (pages 71–72) in full:
   - **SC54** (adds to end of GC 12.5.4) — preamble + four sub-clauses:
     - Preamble: "defect" excludes misuse, failure to perform recommended maintenance, accident, or the wear and tear of normal use.
     - GC 12.5.4.1 — Manufactured item performance standard: capable of intended use for warranty period when used as directed; failure = defect.
     - GC 12.5.4.2 — Design-Builder bears all investigation, test, repair, replacement, and resulting damage costs; without undue delay.
     - GC 12.5.4.3 — Warranty work at Owner convenience (overtime at Design-Builder cost prior to warranty expiry); Owner gives notice promptly; Owner reserves right to carry out detailed and exhaustive inspection.
     - GC 12.5.4.4 — Design-Builder must make good, correct, repair or replace all defective or unsatisfactory materials and workmanship disclosed by inspection.
   - **SC55** (adds new GC 12.5.9 and GC 12.5.10):
     - GC 12.5.9 — Excessive servicing during warranty period = deemed defective; warranty (or free maintenance period) deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected.
     - GC 12.5.10 — Design-Builder makes good in permanent manner, satisfactory to Owner, any and all damage to the Work during warranty period; commences repairs within twenty (20) working days of receipt of notice from Owner.
3. Read RFP §7.5 (page 24) to understand substantial performance prerequisites — five items that must be received by Owner before Work is considered fit for intended use (Occupancy Permit, final commissioning documents, all O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, Legal Survey).
4. Review Specification.md (R-01 through R-10) and Guidance.md (Principles P-001–P-007, Considerations C-001–C-006, Conflict Table CON-01 and CON-02).

**V-1 (Verification):**
- [ ] RFP §7.6 read; both warranty bullets understood.
- [ ] SC54 preamble and all four GC 12.5.4 sub-clauses (.1 through .4) read and noted.
- [ ] SC55 GC 12.5.9 and GC 12.5.10 read and noted; "deemed to take effect" language confirmed.
- [ ] RFP §7.5 read; five substantial performance prerequisites identified.
- [ ] Specification.md R-01 through R-10 reviewed.
- [ ] Guidance.md Conflict Table CON-01 and CON-02 reviewed.

---

### Step 2 — Establish Narrative Structure and Outline

**Action:**
1. Create a draft outline with the following recommended sections (adjust as appropriate):
   - **Introduction:** Why warranty matters for a critical public facility; Design-Builder's commitment.
   - **Warranty Scope:** 12-month all-inclusive coverage; start date (occupancy permit); what is covered (all materials and workmanship).
   - **Defect Definition:** What constitutes a defect (SC54 framework); what is excluded (misuse, maintenance failure, accident, wear and tear of normal use).
   - **Design-Builder Obligations:** Investigation and repair costs (GC 12.5.4.2); repair commencement timeline — twenty (20) working days (GC 12.5.10); permanent repairs; making good all damage.
   - **Owner Convenience Scheduling and Overtime:** Owner-convenience scheduling; overtime at Design-Builder cost (GC 12.5.4.3); prompt notice obligation.
   - **Owner Rights:** Exhaustive inspection right (GC 12.5.4.3 and .4); Design-Builder remedy obligation for all disclosed defects.
   - **Excessive Servicing:** Deemed defective provision (GC 12.5.9); "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" mechanism.
   - **Manufacturer Warranties:** Collection, O&M Manual inclusion, assignment to Owner (RFP §7.6).
   - **Warranty Support and Integration:** Warranty coordinator contact; alignment with DEL-08-01 commissioning and DEL-08-02 deficiencies.

2. Estimate section length: approximately 400–600 words total (ASSUMPTION: typical proposal narrative section of 1.5–2 pages; length not specified in RFP).

3. Cross-check outline against Specification.md R-01 through R-10 to confirm every requirement has a designated section.

**V-2 (Verification):**
- [ ] Outline covers all ten requirements (R-01 through R-10) in identified sections.
- [ ] Structure flows logically (scope → definitions → obligations → rights → excessive servicing → manufacturer warranties → integration).
- [ ] Word count estimate noted.

---

### Step 3 — Draft Narrative Sections

**Action:**

1. **Introduction (1 paragraph):**
   - Identify the Penhold PSB as a critical public facility (Fire Hall + Public Works operations) requiring robust, unambiguous warranty coverage.
   - State that the Design-Builder's warranty approach is designed to protect the Owner's investment and ensure operational continuity during the 12-month warranty period.
   - Note that warranty is coordinated with commissioning (DEL-08-01) and deficiency resolution (DEL-08-02) to present a seamless closeout-to-operations strategy.

2. **Warranty Scope (1–2 paragraphs):**
   - State explicitly: "The Design-Builder will provide a twelve (12) month all-inclusive warranty covering all labour and materials for all work performed. The warranty period commences from the date the occupancy permit is issued."
   - Clarify scope: "The warranty covers all materials, products, and workmanship performed by the Design-Builder and its subtrades and subcontractors."

3. **Defect Definition (2 paragraphs):**
   - Paragraph 1 — preamble exclusions (SC54): "The term 'defect' does not include imperfections that would naturally follow misuse, failure to perform recommended maintenance, accident, or the wear and tear of normal use."
   - Paragraph 2 — manufactured item standard (GC 12.5.4.1): "Any manufactured item or material, when used as directed, must be capable of its intended use for the full warranty period. Failure to meet this standard constitutes a defect, whether the cause is traced to a product manufacturing issue or installation error."

4. **Design-Builder Obligations (2 paragraphs):**
   - Paragraph 1 — full cost bearing (GC 12.5.4.2): "The Design-Builder bears the full cost of investigating, testing, repairing, and replacing any defective work, including the cost of making good any resulting damage. The Owner will not be asked to share investigation or remediation costs. All required corrective or replacement work will be performed without undue delay."
   - Paragraph 2 — repair timeline and permanence (GC 12.5.10): "Upon receiving notice of a defect from the Owner, the Design-Builder will commence corrective or replacement work within twenty (20) working days. All warranty repairs will be made in a permanent manner, satisfactory to the Owner, including making good any and all damage to the Work during the warranty period."

5. **Owner Convenience Scheduling and Overtime (1 paragraph per GC 12.5.4.3):**
   - "All corrective, remedial, or replacement work will be executed at times convenient for the Owner, which may entail overtime work. Additional charges for overtime work prior to warranty expiry are borne by the Design-Builder. The Owner is asked to give notice of observed defects promptly."

6. **Owner Rights (1 paragraph per GC 12.5.4.4):**
   - "The Owner retains the right to carry out a detailed and exhaustive inspection of the Project at any time during the warranty period. The Design-Builder is obligated to make good, correct, repair, or replace all defective or unsatisfactory materials and workmanship that any such inspection discloses."

7. **Excessive Servicing (1 paragraph per GC 12.5.9):**
   - "Any material or equipment that requires excessive servicing during the warranty period shall be deemed defective. In such cases, the Design-Builder will identify and correct the root cause, and the warranty shall be deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected — ensuring the Owner receives a full warranty protection period following each correction. The Design-Builder and Owner will define maintenance interval standards in the O&M Manual; service call frequencies significantly exceeding those standards may trigger this provision."
   - Note (for PM): Flag CON-01 (Guidance.md Conflict Table) — quantitative "excessive servicing" threshold is not defined in the RFP; to be clarified at contract kickoff.

8. **Manufacturer Warranties (1–2 paragraphs per RFP §7.6):**
   - "All manufacturer warranties and guarantee certificates for building products and systems — including but not limited to roofing, flooring, HVAC, electrical fixtures, plumbing, overhead doors, and appliances — will be collected by the Design-Builder and assigned to the Owner."
   - "These warranties are compiled in the Operation & Maintenance Manual, along with manufacturer contact information, warranty periods, and claim procedures for each product. Manufacturer warranties typically provide long-term protection (1–20+ years) on product performance, extending the Owner's protection well beyond the 12-month Design-Builder warranty."

9. **Warranty Support and Integration (1 paragraph):**
   - "The Design-Builder will designate a warranty coordinator with 24/7 availability for emergency defect notifications during the 12-month period. Contact information will be provided in the O&M Manual (DEL-08-01). A triage process will be established: safety-critical defects (structural, fire suppression, emergency generator, apparatus bay doors) receive immediate response; priority defects receive response within 10 working days; routine defects are scheduled at Owner convenience within the twenty (20) working day maximum. This warranty approach is coordinated with the Commissioning Narrative (DEL-08-01) and Deficiencies Management Narrative (DEL-08-02) to present a unified closeout and Owner-protection strategy."

**V-3 (Verification):**
- [ ] Introduction identifies public facility context and warranty intent.
- [ ] Warranty Scope explicitly states 12 months, "labour and materials," and "date the occupancy permit is issued."
- [ ] Defect Definition uses SC54 preamble language (misuse, maintenance failure, accident, wear and tear of normal use); manufactured item standard included.
- [ ] Design-Builder Obligations cover full cost bearing, "without undue delay," twenty (20) working day timeline, permanent repairs, making good all damage.
- [ ] Owner Convenience Scheduling addresses Owner-convenience scheduling and overtime costs.
- [ ] Owner Rights section includes exhaustive inspection right (GC 12.5.4.4) and remedy obligation.
- [ ] Excessive Servicing uses "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" language (not merely "restarts").
- [ ] Manufacturer Warranties section covers collection, O&M Manual, and assignment to Owner.
- [ ] Warranty Support section references DEL-08-01 and O&M Manual; describes coordinator and tiered triage.

**V-4 (Verification):**
- [ ] R-01 through R-10 each confirmed as addressed in the designated sections.
- [ ] No requirement is missing, qualified, or incorrectly described.
- [ ] TBD flags (if any) documented in Guidance.md Conflict Table (CON-01, CON-02).

---

### Step 5 — Review for Consistency with Related Deliverables

**Action:**
1. **Cross-reference with DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Narrative):**
   - Does the warranty narrative align with the commissioning and O&M handover strategy?
   - Is the warranty start timing (occupancy permit) consistent with the commissioning completion sequence in DEL-08-01?
   - Are there any contradictions in how the O&M Manual is referenced (format, contents, timing of delivery)?
   - Is the warranty coordinator role consistent with, or distinct from, the commissioning lead role in DEL-08-01?

2. **Cross-reference with DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management Narrative):**
   - Does the warranty narrative clearly distinguish between deficiencies (pre-occupancy permit) and warranty defects (post-occupancy permit)?
   - Is the transition from deficiency resolution to warranty coverage unambiguous?
   - Does the 12-month warranty period review mentioned in DEL-08-02 align with the warranty terms here?

3. **Cross-reference with Datasheet.md:**
   - Are all attribute values consistent: 12 months, occupancy permit date trigger, SC54–SC55 clause references, twenty (20) working days, "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected"?
   - Are source page references consistent (RFP page 25, Appendix J pages 71–72)?

**V-5 (Verification):**
- [ ] Warranty narrative consistent with DEL-08-01 commissioning strategy and O&M Manual delivery.
- [ ] Commissioning completion occurs before occupancy permit issuance — sequencing consistent.
- [ ] Deficiency period and warranty period clearly distinguished; no overlap.
- [ ] Datasheet.md attribute values consistent with narrative commitments.
- [ ] "Deemed to take effect" language consistent between Datasheet, Specification, and Guidance.
- [ ] No internal contradictions across DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, and DEL-08-03.

---

### Step 6 — Validate Against Evaluation Scoring Context

**Action:**
1. Review RFP §8.2 Scoring Matrix (page 26):
   - "Commissioning, Training, Closeout Procedures" = 2 points (shared across DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, and DEL-08-03 within PKG-008).
   - Scoring scale: Unacceptable (0–40%) through Exceptional (100%); Very Good = 80%; Good = 70%; Acceptable = 50%.

2. Assess narrative strength against evaluation criteria:
   - Does the narrative demonstrate **competence** in warranty risk management and Owner protection?
   - Does it explicitly show **understanding of SC54–SC55 GC sub-clause numbering** (not just cite them by SC number)?
   - Does it use **precise source language** (e.g., "deemed to take effect," "wear and tear of normal use," "without undue delay")?
   - Does it **distinguish** the Design-Builder's approach from a generic CCDC 14-2013 warranty statement?
   - Is the **Owner-protective framing** appropriate for a public municipal facility?
   - Does it **coordinate** with commissioning and deficiency management strategies?

3. Benchmark against scoring rubric:
   - Exceptional (100% = 2 pts): Exceeds expectations; adds innovation (e.g., tiered emergency response, warranty tracker in O&M Manual, voluntary extended coverage on high-risk systems).
   - Excellent (90%): Clear understanding; certainty of compliance; precise SC clause language.
   - Very Good (80%): Meets expectations; demonstrates solid understanding of SC54–SC55.
   - Below 70%: Risk to project success; fails to address SC54–SC55 adequately.

**V-6 (Verification):**
- [ ] Narrative demonstrates competence in warranty and risk management.
- [ ] SC54–SC55 provisions are explained with GC sub-clause references (not just "SC54" or "SC55").
- [ ] Precise source language used for key terms ("deemed to take effect," "wear and tear of normal use," "twenty (20) working days," "without undue delay").
- [ ] Owner protections are clearly articulated from the Owner's perspective.
- [ ] Narrative could be scored "Very Good" or above on the RFP evaluation rubric.

### Step 7 — Final Proofreading and Quality Check

**Action:**
1. **Spelling and Grammar:** Use spell-check; read aloud for clarity and natural flow.
2. **Terminology Consistency:**
   - "Design-Builder" (not "contractor," "DB," or "builder" unless defined on first use).
   - "Owner" (consistent with RFP terminology).
   - "Defect" (as per SC54 enhanced definition — not "flaw," "failure," or "issue" interchangeably).
   - "Wear and tear of normal use" (SC54 preamble exact phrase — not "normal wear and tear").
   - "Deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" (GC 12.5.9 exact phrase — not "restarts").
   - "Twenty (20) working days" (GC 12.5.10 exact form — not "20 calendar days" or "20-day").
   - Acronyms defined on first use: "Operation and Maintenance (O&M)," "CCDC 14-2013," "Supplementary Conditions (SC)."
3. **Requirement Compliance:** Verify all ten requirements (R-01 through R-10) are met. Check that no SC54–SC55 obligations are softened or omitted.
4. **Format:** Use consistent heading levels (H2, H3) for section organization. Check line length and paragraph breaks for readability. Ensure document is in Markdown or Word format suitable for PDF conversion.

**V-7 (Verification):**
- [ ] Spell-check and grammar review complete.
- [ ] Terminology consistent: "Design-Builder," "Owner," "defect," "wear and tear of normal use," "deemed to take effect," "twenty (20) working days" all used uniformly.
- [ ] **P-001 Source-Language Fidelity Checklist** — confirm each phrase appears **verbatim** in the final narrative (not paraphrased):
  - [ ] "wear and tear of normal use" (SC54 preamble) — NOT "normal wear and tear"
  - [ ] "deemed to take effect from the time that the defect has been corrected" (SC55 GC 12.5.9) — NOT "restarts" or "resets"
  - [ ] "without undue delay" (SC54 GC 12.5.4.2) — NOT "promptly" or "as soon as possible"
  - [ ] "twenty (20) working days" (SC55 GC 12.5.10) — NOT "20 calendar days" or "20-day"
  *(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing C-001; Guidance P-001)*
- [ ] Acronyms defined on first use.
- [ ] All ten requirements confirmed as met.
- [ ] Format clean and readable; suitable for proposal PDF.
