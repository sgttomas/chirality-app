# Guidance — DEL-08-01: Commissioning, Training, and Closeout Narrative

---

## Purpose

This deliverable responds to RFP §7.3.6 and §7.5 (Town of Penhold PSB RFP 2024_004). The Town requires a credible, systematic account of how the Design-Builder will: (1) commission all building systems to verify they operate as designed, (2) conduct and document staff training, (3) prepare and deliver O&M manuals and as-built drawings in specified formats, (4) collect and assign product warranties and guarantees, (5) close out all deficiencies prior to Final Completion, and (6) support the Owner through the 12-month Warranty Period.

This deliverable is one of three in PKG-008 (Commissioning, Closeout & Warranty):
- **DEL-08-01** (this deliverable): Commissioning, training, and closeout narrative
- **DEL-08-02**: Deficiencies management narrative (punch list process, holdback, warranty review)
- **DEL-08-03**: Warranty requirements narrative (warranty terms, scope, SC enhancements)

Together, these three deliverables represent the Design-Builder's end-of-project strategy and are evaluated under the "Commissioning, Training and Closeout Procedures" sub-criterion worth **2 points** of the 100-point evaluation (RFP §8.2, p. 26), contributing to OBJ-002 (Maximize Project Delivery Plan score).

## Principles

**P-001 — Commissioning is planned, not improvised.** Commissioning is not an afterthought; it is a structured process planned from the start of construction, with defined milestones, roles, and test criteria, culminating in verified system performance and Owner sign-off before occupancy.

**P-002 — Owner readiness is the primary outcome.** The endpoint is not a signed-off checklist but a building where operations staff understand their systems, possess the documentation to maintain them, and can respond to faults. The narrative must make this intent credible and specific.

**P-003 — Documentation preconditions Substantial Performance.** RFP §7.5 is explicit: the Work is not fit for its intended use until the Owner holds five specific documents (Occupancy Permit, final commissioning documents, all O&M manuals, as-built drawings, legal survey). The narrative must acknowledge this contractual trigger and demonstrate readiness to meet it.

**P-004 — Warranty period support extends the relationship.** The Commissioning and Closeout narrative is not complete without addressing how the Design-Builder will assist the Owner through the 12-month Warranty Period and rectify identified deficiencies before warranty end. This is explicitly required by RFP §7.3.6.

**P-005 — Specificity wins evaluations.** A generic commissioning description is scored at "Acceptable" or "Fair" (50–60%) on the evaluation matrix (RFP §8.3). A response that names systems, roles, timelines, and documentation specifics to the Penhold PSB context — Fire Hall, Public Works, 50-year main building, 20-year ancillary — demonstrates "clear understanding of the requirements" (80–100% range).

## Considerations

**C-001 — What systems require commissioning?**
The Penhold PSB is a combined Fire Hall and Public Works facility. Systems likely requiring commissioning include:
- Mechanical: HVAC (apparatus bay exhaust, make-up air, station area, admin area), plumbing, hot water, fire suppression (if provided), in-floor heating (if provided)
- Electrical: main distribution, lighting and controls, emergency power (standby generator), fire alarm, security/access control (if included as options)
- Life safety: fire alarm, emergency lighting, exit signage, emergency communications
- Specialty: diesel standby generator, 2-inch water fill stations, apparatus bay overhead doors (secondary opening), bay sump systems
- Envelope: occupancy-related envelope performance (thermal, moisture) is verified through code inspections; not typically full commissioning

ASSUMPTION: The exact system list depends on final design. The proposal narrative should acknowledge a broad scope and commit to commissioning all systems per design intent.

**C-002 — Level of commissioning depth.**
RFP language ("ensure all systems operate as designed") implies functional verification, not advanced retro-commissioning. For Penhold:
- Minimum: basic verification (systems energized and operating within design parameters)
- Appropriate: moderate commissioning (functional performance testing; systems meet design specifications; Owner sign-off per system)
- Enhanced: would add optimization, trend logging, and post-occupancy verification — beyond RFP requirements but could differentiate at evaluation

ASSUMPTION: Moderate commissioning is appropriate for a municipal fire/public works facility of this scale.

**C-003 — O&M manual content list (complete per RFP §7.5).**
The RFP §7.5 specifies that O&M manuals shall include:
- All maintenance equipment documentation
- Testing certificates of new systems, equipment, and materials
- Manufacturer/supplier contact list
- Product warranties and guarantee certificates
- Start-up reports
The narrative must commit to all five content categories, not just the format (2 hard copies + digital).

**C-004 — As-built drawing format distinction.**
RFP §7.5 makes a specific distinction: As-built drawings of all physical building attributes, with **electrical, mechanical, and plumbing details** submitted in CAD (DWG and PDF), and **all others submitted in PDF**. This is a specific, testable requirement. The narrative (and proposal) must match this precisely — do not expand the CAD requirement to all disciplines unless the Design-Builder is voluntarily providing more.

**C-005 — Training audience for this facility.**
Training audiences at a Fire Hall + Public Works facility differ from a typical office building:
- Firefighting crews (apparatus operation, generator, fill stations, specialty equipment)
- Maintenance and public works staff (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, sump systems, site equipment)
- IT/communications staff (if security, access control, and network systems are included)
- Senior staff / facility manager (overall system overview, emergency shutdown, warranty claims)
The narrative should acknowledge this multi-audience context.

**C-006 — Deficiency closeout linkage.**
RFP §7.3.6 requires the narrative to describe how deficiencies will be closed prior to Final Completion Date. While the detailed deficiency management process lives in DEL-08-02, this narrative must contain enough to demonstrate that commissioning findings and trade punch list items will be tracked, resolved, and confirmed closed before final payment. A cross-reference to DEL-08-02 is appropriate but not a substitute for the specific description required here.

**C-007 — Warranty period support.**
RFP §7.3.6 requires describing how the Owner will be assisted through the Warranty Period and how identified deficiencies will be rectified before its end. Key elements:
- Who is the Design-Builder's point of contact during the 12-month warranty period?
- What is the response time commitment for warranty calls?
- How is the 12-month warranty period review (per DEL-08-02 context) coordinated?
- How are manufacturer warranties escalated vs. Design-Builder warranty obligations?

**C-008 — Digital O&M format.**
RFP §7.5 says digital copy in "a format approved by the Owner." This leaves the format open for negotiation. Practical options: searchable PDF package, cloud storage folder, or integration with a Facility Management system. The proposal should specify a proposed format and invite Owner approval, which demonstrates flexibility and Owner-orientation.

**C-009 — Commissioning sequence prioritization.** (Enrichment ref: B-003)
For a Fire Hall with life-safety systems, the order in which systems are commissioned affects schedule risk and safety readiness. The narrative should consider a prioritized commissioning sequence. ASSUMPTION — a reasonable sequencing approach based on facility type:
1. **Life-safety systems first:** Fire alarm, emergency lighting, emergency communications, exit signage — these must be functional before occupancy-related testing and inspections.
2. **Mechanical / HVAC:** Apparatus bay exhaust, make-up air, in-slab heating, station HVAC — these affect occupant health and safety and must be verified before extended occupancy.
3. **Electrical:** Main distribution, lighting controls, standby generator (including load bank test) — generator testing may require coordination with utility and should be scheduled early enough for re-testing if needed.
4. **Specialty systems:** 2-inch water fill stations, apparatus bay overhead doors, bay sump systems — these are operationally critical for Fire Hall function.
5. **Envelope / code inspections:** Final building and fire code inspections, occupancy permit application — these are the culmination of the commissioning sequence.

The rationale for life-safety-first sequencing is that any failures in these systems require resolution before the building can be occupied, and early testing provides maximum schedule float for remediation. Source: ASSUMPTION based on facility type (Fire Hall with life-safety obligations) and general commissioning practice.

**C-010 — Post-occupancy seasonal verification.** (Enrichment ref: D-001)
Guidance C-002 discusses commissioning depth but stops at pre-occupancy. For a Fire Hall with HVAC, in-slab heating, and a standby generator operating across Alberta's seasonal extremes (winter lows of -30C and below; summer highs above +30C), the proposal author should consider whether the narrative describes any post-occupancy seasonal commissioning or system tuning during the 12-month warranty period.

Options:
- **Minimum (RFP baseline):** All commissioning completed pre-occupancy; warranty period covers defect rectification only.
- **Differentiated:** The narrative commits to a seasonal performance check (e.g., heating system verified during first winter, cooling/ventilation verified during first summer) as part of warranty-period support. This would be a voluntary enhancement and potential evaluation differentiator, not an RFP requirement.

ASSUMPTION: RFP does not explicitly require post-occupancy seasonal verification; this is a potential enhancement that could strengthen the "Commissioning, Training and Closeout Procedures" score. Source: RFP §7.3.6 (warranty support); Guidance C-002 (commissioning depth); **location TBD** for any RFP language on post-occupancy performance verification.

**C-011 — End-to-end quality lifecycle framing.** (Enrichment ref: E-002)
Guidance addresses commissioning (C-001/C-002), deficiency closeout (C-006), and warranty support (C-007) as separate considerations. The proposal author should consider whether the narrative benefits from an explicit end-to-end quality lifecycle framing that connects these phases into a continuous thread: commissioning verification leads to deficiency identification, deficiency closeout confirms system readiness, warranty-period monitoring confirms sustained performance, and the 12-month warranty review provides formal closure.

TBD: Whether to frame commissioning-to-deficiency-to-warranty as a continuous quality lifecycle in the narrative, or treat each as a standalone phase. An integrated framing may demonstrate stronger "clear understanding of the requirements" (RFP §8.3, 80–100% scoring band) but adds narrative complexity. This is a question for the proposal author. Source: RFP §7.3.6 (commissioning + warranty support); RFP §7.3.7 (deficiency management); Guidance C-001, C-006, C-007.

**C-012 — Evaluation scoring mapping.** (Enrichment ref: C-002)
P-005 states that specificity wins evaluations and references the 80–100% vs 50–60% scoring bands, but does not map specific narrative elements to score improvement. To guide the author more precisely:

| Scoring Band | Narrative Characteristics | Example Elements |
|---|---|---|
| 80–100% ("Clear understanding") | Names Penhold PSB-specific systems; defines commissioning roles by name/title; commits to measurable timelines; addresses all five Substantial Performance trigger documents explicitly; describes multi-audience training; provides O&M manual structure outline | EX-001 (commissioning scope), EX-003 (O&M commitment), EX-004 (warranty support with response timelines) |
| 60–80% ("Acceptable") | Addresses all RFP requirements but in general terms; systems not enumerated; timelines vague; training described generically | Generic commissioning statement covering "all systems" without listing them |
| 50–60% ("Fair") | Addresses most requirements; missing one or more key elements; no facility-specific detail | EX-002 (weak commissioning statement) |
| Below 50% | Missing requirements; contradicts RFP; no credible methodology | Omitting deficiency closeout or warranty support |

Source: RFP §8.3 (evaluation matrix scoring bands); ASSUMPTION on specific mapping — scoring interpretation is evaluator-dependent. (Enrichment ref: C-002)

## Trade-offs

**T-001 — Commissioning depth vs. cost and schedule.**
Comprehensive commissioning (system optimization, trend logging, post-occupancy review) adds cost and schedule risk. Basic functional testing may miss latent issues that manifest within the warranty period, increasing warranty call volume. For a 50-year facility with significant life-safety systems (generator, fire suppression, apparatus exhaust), a moderate commissioning level is the appropriate balance. Source: ASSUMPTION based on facility type and RFP language.

**T-002 — Specificity in proposal narrative vs. flexibility in execution.**
A highly specific commissioning plan in the proposal (naming exact test protocols, staffing levels, and timelines) is credible and scores well but limits post-award flexibility. A general description is flexible but may score poorly. Recommendation: name systems, sequence, and key responsibilities; avoid prescriptive test protocols (which will be refined post-award with the actual design).

**T-003 — Training depth vs. Owner staff capacity.**
Deep multi-day training is thorough but may exceed the availability and absorption capacity of a small municipal operations team. Tiered training (operator-level orientation for all staff; maintenance-level training for designated facility leads) is more practical. Documentation (manuals, quick-reference guides, video recordings) extends training effectiveness beyond the on-site session.

**T-004 — Hard copy vs. digital O&M emphasis.**
Hard copies are RFP-required (2 binders) and physically durable in a fire hall environment. Digital copies are required too but serve a different purpose (searchability, version updates, system integration). The proposal should not frame these as alternatives — both are mandatory per RFP §7.5 — but should describe how each format serves different operational needs.

## Examples

**EX-001 — Strong commissioning scope statement (Good Practice):**
"The Design-Builder will commission all building systems prior to occupancy permit application, including: apparatus bay exhaust and make-up air units, station HVAC and in-slab heating (if applicable), plumbing and hot water systems, diesel standby generator (load bank testing), 2-inch water fill stations, fire alarm and emergency lighting, apparatus bay overhead doors and sump systems, and electrical main and sub-panels. Functional performance testing will be conducted per manufacturer specifications and design intent, with written sign-off by the responsible trade, the commissioning lead, and the Owner's representative."

Source: ASSUMPTION — based on RFP §7.5 and Penhold PSB systems described in RFP Appendix A/B and Addendum 03.

**EX-002 — Weak commissioning scope statement (What to Avoid):**
"The Design-Builder will commission all systems in accordance with applicable standards and ensure the building is operational upon handover." This is too generic to score above "Fair" (60%) on the evaluation matrix. It does not name systems, describe testing methodology, or demonstrate understanding of the specific facility.

**EX-003 — O&M manual commitment (Good Practice):**
"O&M manuals will be delivered as: (1) two hard copies in 3-ring binders with labelled tabs organized by building system, and (2) a complete digital copy in searchable PDF format, provided via secure cloud storage or USB drive in a format approved by the Owner prior to delivery. Each manual will include: manufacturer data sheets, operating procedures, preventive maintenance schedules, troubleshooting guides, emergency procedures, start-up reports, testing certificates, supplier/vendor contact directory, and all product warranties and guarantee certificates. Manuals will be compiled throughout the construction phase and finalized and delivered at least five (5) business days before the occupancy permit application."

Source: ASSUMPTION — procedural recommendation based on RFP §7.5 requirements and industry practice.

**EX-004 — Warranty period support statement (Good Practice):**
"Following occupancy permit issuance, the Design-Builder will assign a designated warranty coordinator as the Owner's single point of contact for all warranty claims during the 12-month all-inclusive warranty period. The warranty coordinator will acknowledge warranty calls within [TBD — recommend 2 business days], provide written investigation reports within [TBD — recommend 5 business days], and coordinate repairs within [TBD — recommend 20 working days]. A formal 12-month warranty review meeting will be scheduled approximately 10 months after occupancy to identify and plan resolution of outstanding warranty items before the warranty period expires."

Source: ASSUMPTION — procedural recommendation; response timing TBD (Design-Builder's commitment); 20-working-day repair commencement referenced in Supplementary Conditions (location TBD in Appendix J per DEL-08-03 context).

*Note on EX-004 TBD values:* The three TBD response timelines (acknowledgement, investigation report, repair commencement) are essential commitment values for the proposal. These should be resolved by the proposal author and recorded as firm commitments in the narrative and in Specification R-006 / Datasheet Attributes table. Without concrete values, the warranty support promise remains non-committal and may score in the lower evaluation bands. (Enrichment ref: B-001)
