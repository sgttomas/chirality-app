# Specification — DEL-08-01: Commissioning, Training, and Closeout Narrative

---

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Commissioning approach narrative for all building systems
- Handover and training documentation strategy
- O&M manual preparation, format, and delivery approach
- As-built drawing capture and delivery approach
- Product warranty and guarantee certificate collection and provision
- Description of staff training program and delivery method
- Description of how all deficiencies will be closed out prior to Final Completion Date
- Description of how the Owner will be assisted through the Warranty Period

**Out of Scope:**
- Deficiencies management process detail (covered by DEL-08-02)
- Warranty terms and conditions detail (covered by DEL-08-03)
- Detailed commissioning test procedures (post-award artifact; not this proposal narrative)
- Actual training content development (post-award artifact; not this proposal narrative)

**Implicit Constraint:** This deliverable provides the proposal narrative response to RFP §7.3.6 and §7.5, demonstrating the Design-Builder's commissioning, training, and closeout methodology. The actual commissioning procedures, training materials, and O&M manuals are post-award construction-phase artifacts.

| R-014 | ASSUMPTION: Commissioning approach shall align with applicable building codes (NBCC / Alberta Building Code) and industry standards for building systems commissioning. Confirm whether ASHRAE Guideline 0 or another commissioning standard should be cited as prescriptive direction, or whether RFP functional verification language is sufficient. | RFP §7.3.6 (implied) | Yes | Commissioning methodology references applicable standards; TBD whether a specific commissioning standard (e.g., ASHRAE Guideline 0) is adopted or RFP functional verification language governs (Enrichment ref: A-001; see also CFT-08-01-B in Guidance.md Conflict Table) |
| R-015 | Coordinate with deficiencies management process (DEL-08-02) to ensure commissioning findings are logged and closeout sequence is aligned. | RFP §7.3.6; §7.3.7 (implied coordination) | Yes | Narrative acknowledges coordination with deficiency process |
| R-016 | Provide confirmation that all five Substantial Performance trigger documents (Occupancy Permit, final commissioning documents, O&M manuals, as-built drawings, legal survey per RFP §7.5) have been delivered as an integrated closeout-readiness verification before Substantial Performance is claimed. | RFP §7.5 | Yes | Single integrative check confirming all five trigger documents are delivered; cross-references V-008 in Procedure (Enrichment ref: F-003) |
