# Procedure — DEL-08-01: Commissioning, Training, and Closeout Narrative

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes how to draft and finalize the Commissioning, Training, and Closeout narrative (DEL-08-01), which is a written section of the Design-Build proposal responding to RFP §7.3.6 and §7.5.

The artifact produced is a proposal narrative (typically 2–4 pages) that describes the Design-Builder's systematic approach to: (1) commissioning all building systems, (2) conducting and documenting staff training, (3) preparing and delivering O&M manuals and as-built drawings, (4) collecting product warranties and guarantees, (5) closing out all deficiencies before Final Completion, and (6) supporting the Owner through the 12-month Warranty Period.

---

## Prerequisites

**P-001 — Source documents read:**
- RFP 2024_004 §7.3.6 (pp. 22–23): Commissioning, Training, and Closeout Procedures requirements
- RFP 2024_004 §7.5 (p. 24): Substantial Performance of the Work — 5-document trigger list and Design-Builder obligations
- RFP 2024_004 §7.6 (p. 25): Warranty Requirements — 12-month all-inclusive warranty from occupancy permit date
- RFP 2024_004 §8.2–8.3 (pp. 26–27): Evaluation criteria and scoring matrix (2-point allocation for this criterion)

**P-002 — Decomposition and context reviewed:**
- Penhold PSB Project Decomposition v2.3 FINAL: SOW-0023, PKG-008 scope, OBJ-002 definition
- All three PKG-008 deliverables understood (DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, DEL-08-03) and their boundaries

**P-003 — Cross-deliverable coordination confirmed:**
- **DEL-08-02** (Deficiencies Management Narrative): closeout sequencing and deficiency tracking; commissioning findings feed into deficiency register
- **DEL-08-03** (Warranty Requirements Narrative): warranty terms, scope, and SC enhancements; commissioning handover triggers warranty period start
- **DEL-07-05** (Quality Management Narrative): QA/QC framework; commissioning is part of quality closure
- **DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02** (Construction Methodology and Administration Narratives): site procedures and administration sequence; commissioning is coordinated with construction close-out phase
- **DEL-09-01** (Detailed Project Schedule): commissioning and closeout milestones confirmed as scheduled activities

**P-004 — Design input available:**
- Conceptual design sufficiently advanced (DEL-02-01 through DEL-02-05) to identify all systems requiring commissioning
- Building systems strategy from mechanical (DEL-02-03), electrical (DEL-02-04), and civil/structural concepts

**P-005 — Owner-side training readiness confirmed:** (Enrichment ref: X-001)
- Owner has identified training attendees by role/function (firefighting crews, public works staff, facility manager designate, IT/security staff as applicable)
- Owner has designated a facility manager or operations lead who will serve as the primary training recipient and sign-off authority for competency verification
- If Owner has not yet designated attendees, the narrative should note this as a post-award coordination item and include a trigger for requesting the attendee list at a defined project milestone (e.g., 60 days before scheduled training)

## Steps

### Step 1 — Establish Commissioning Scope and Systems List

**Action:**
1. Working from the conceptual design (DEL-02-xx) and RFP Appendix A (OSR) and Appendix B (Functional Program), identify all building systems requiring commissioning. Candidates for the Penhold PSB include:
   - Mechanical: HVAC (apparatus bay exhaust, make-up air, station/admin areas), in-slab heating (ASSUMPTION: if included), plumbing, hot water systems
   - Electrical: main distribution, lighting and controls, emergency power (standby generator with load bank test), fire alarm, security/access control (if included as options)
   - Life safety: fire alarm, emergency lighting, exit signage, emergency communications
   - Specialty: diesel standby generator, 2-inch water fill stations, apparatus bay overhead doors (secondary opening function), bay sump systems
   - Envelope / building integrity: occupancy-related code compliance verified through mandatory inspections (building and fire code)

2. Define commissioning depth: functional performance testing (moderate level) is appropriate for this facility — verify each system operates within design parameters, responds to controls, meets safety requirements, and is ready for Owner operation. (Source: RFP §7.5; ASSUMPTION on commissioning level.)

3. Define commissioning roles: Commissioning Lead (Design-Builder); mechanical/electrical contractors (primary test participants); Owner's representative (sign-off); AHJ inspectors (code-related systems).

4. Define commissioning timeline: commissioning activities begin during final construction phase; all systems commissioned and documented before occupancy permit application.

**Output:** Commissioning systems list and approach outline (input to narrative draft).

---

### Step 2 — Define Training Program Approach

**Action:**
1. Identify training audiences for the Penhold Fire Hall + Public Works facility (confirm against P-005 Owner-designated attendee list, if available):
   - Firefighting and apparatus crew (apparatus bay systems, generator, fill stations, overhead doors)
   - Public works / maintenance staff (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, sump systems, site services)
   - Facility manager or designate (overall building operation, emergency shutdowns, warranty claims)
   - IT/security staff (access control, security cameras, communications — if options included)

2. Confirm Owner has designated training attendees and facility manager lead per P-005. If not yet designated, include a coordination trigger in the narrative (e.g., "Owner to confirm training attendees by [milestone]"). (Enrichment ref: X-001)

3. Define training scope per audience: each system receives a dedicated training module; scope linked directly to commissioning systems list from Step 1.

4. Define delivery method: on-site hands-on sessions at system locations; supplemented by training manuals, quick-reference guides, and (ASSUMPTION) video recording of key sessions for future reference.

5. Define competency verification: attendance log per session; hands-on sign-off per system module; written acknowledgement by Owner's designated lead. (Source: ASSUMPTION — RFP §7.3.6 requires documentation; method not specified.)

6. Define training schedule: training completed before or at occupancy permit; key operator training completed before handover; refresher training availability noted for post-occupancy.

**Output:** Training program approach outline (input to narrative draft).

---

### Step 3 — Define O&M Manual Strategy

**Action:**
1. Confirm RFP §7.5 format requirement: 2 hard copies in 3-ring binders with labelled tabs + 1 complete digital copy in Owner-approved format.

2. Define O&M manual content per RFP §7.5 (all five items must be included):
   - All maintenance equipment documentation (manufacturer data sheets, operating procedures, maintenance schedules)
   - Testing certificates of new systems, equipment, and materials
   - Supplier/manufacturer contact list
   - Product warranties and guarantee certificates (roofing, flooring, electrical fixtures, appliances, equipment)
   - Start-up reports for all commissioned systems

3. Organize manual structure: table of contents; system-by-system sections (matching commissioning systems list); cross-system sections (emergency contacts, regulatory information, building overview).

4. Define digital format: propose searchable PDF package organized to mirror hard copy structure; note that final format is subject to Owner approval per RFP §7.5 (CFT-08-01-A).

5. Define O&M preparation timeline: collect trade documents throughout construction; compile and review during closeout; final delivery at least 5 business days before occupancy permit application. (Source: ASSUMPTION — specific lead time not stated in RFP.)

**Output:** O&M manual strategy outline (input to narrative draft).

---

### Step 4 — Define As-Built Drawing Strategy

**Action:**
1. Confirm RFP §7.5 format requirement precisely:
   - As-built drawings of all physical building attributes, including **electrical, mechanical, and plumbing details**: submitted in CAD (DWG and PDF)
   - **All other drawings**: submitted in PDF

2. Define as-built scope by discipline:
   - Electrical (CAD): panel schedules, single-line diagrams, circuiting, device locations
   - Mechanical (CAD): HVAC layout, equipment, piping, ductwork, controls schematics
   - Plumbing (CAD): supply, waste, drainage, fixtures
   - Architectural (PDF): floor plans, elevations, sections, details reflecting as-built construction
   - Structural (PDF): framing plans, connection details, as-built notes
   - Civil/site (PDF): grading, utilities, paving, drainage as-built
   - Specialty (PDF or CAD as applicable): generator, sump, specialty equipment

3. Define update process: field change and substitution log maintained throughout construction; trade contractors responsible for red-lining drawings; Design-Builder responsible for compiling and issuing final as-built set; final QA review before delivery.

4. Define delivery: DWG and PDF files organized by discipline and sheet number; delivered via USB drive or secure cloud storage to Owner; two printed PDF sets provided per O&M binder set.

**Output:** As-built drawing strategy outline (input to narrative draft).

---

### Step 5 — Define Warranty and Guarantee Certificate Collection

**Action:**
1. Confirm warranty framework (RFP §7.6):
   - 12-month all-inclusive (labour and materials) warranty from occupancy permit issuance date
   - All manufacturer warranties and guarantees assigned to Owner via O&M manual

2. Define collection process: require all trades and suppliers to provide original product warranties and manufacturer guarantee certificates before or at Substantial Performance; Design-Builder responsible for completeness. (Enrichment ref: F-002 — normalized from "substantial completion" to "Substantial Performance" per RFP/CCDC contractual terminology)

3. Create warranty register: index by system/trade, product name, warranty period, claim procedures, and contact information; include in O&M manual and provide as separate standalone document for Owner reference.

4. Define warranty-period support structure (per RFP §7.3.6): designate a single warranty coordinator; define acknowledgement and response timelines (TBD — Design-Builder's commitment); schedule formal 12-month warranty period review approximately 10 months after occupancy to identify and plan resolution of outstanding items.

**Output:** Warranty and guarantee certificate collection approach (input to narrative draft).

---

### Step 6 — Define Deficiency Closeout and Warranty Period Support

**Action:**
1. Describe deficiency closeout linked to commissioning: commissioning deficiencies and trade punch list items are logged in a single deficiency register (coordinated with DEL-08-02); all deficiencies are classified and resolved before Final Completion Date; any items deferred to warranty period are formally documented and tracked.

2. Describe handover milestone: the Work is not considered fit for intended use until the Owner has received all five documents (Occupancy Permit, final commissioning documents, all O&M manuals, as-built drawings, legal survey) per RFP §7.5; handover formally marked by delivery of all five.

3. Describe warranty period support: Design-Builder provides warranty coordinator contact; commits to timely response and repair of deficiencies identified during warranty period; conducts a warranty review near end of period to ensure all outstanding items are resolved before warranty expiry.

4. Cross-reference DEL-08-02 (detailed deficiency management process) and DEL-08-03 (detailed warranty terms) in the narrative to keep DEL-08-01 appropriately scoped.

**Output:** Deficiency closeout and warranty-period support approach (input to narrative draft).

---

### Step 7 — Draft the Narrative Section

**Action:**
1. Using outputs from Steps 1–6, draft the narrative (target 2–4 pages) organized as follows:
   - **Introduction:** Why commissioning matters for a combined Fire Hall / Public Works facility; Design-Builder's commitment to Owner readiness
   - **Commissioning Approach:** Systems scope; verification methodology; commissioning roles and timeline
   - **Training Program:** Audience; scope per system; delivery method; competency documentation
   - **O&M Manuals:** Content (all five RFP §7.5 categories); organization; format (2 hard copies in 3-ring binders + digital); delivery timeline
   - **As-Built Drawings:** CAD (DWG+PDF) for electrical/mechanical/plumbing; PDF for others; update process; delivery method
   - **Product Warranties and Guarantees:** Collection process; warranty register; assignment to Owner
   - **Deficiency Closeout:** Process for closing all deficiencies prior to Final Completion Date; link to DEL-08-02
   - **Warranty Period Support:** Warranty coordinator; response commitments; 12-month review; deficiency rectification before warranty end; link to DEL-08-03

2. Verify narrative directly addresses RFP §7.3.6 and §7.5 language. Use the checklist below:

| RFP Requirement (§7.3.6 / §7.5) | Addressed in Narrative? |
|---|---|
| Commissioning approach described | [ ] |
| How handover and training will work | [ ] |
| Documentation of training and instruction manuals | [ ] |
| Approach to completing as-built drawings and O&M manuals quality and timely | [ ] |
| How all deficiencies will be closed out prior to Final Completion Date | [ ] |
| How Owner assisted through Warranty Period | [ ] |
| How identified deficiencies rectified before end of Warranty Period | [ ] |
| Closeout procedure coordinated with vendors, designers, Building Operations staff | [ ] |
| Staff training on all building systems, fully documented | [ ] |
| Regulatory approvals for occupancy (building, fire code, occupancy, environmental permits) | [ ] |
| O&M manuals: 2 hard copies (3-ring binders, labelled tabs) + digital (Owner-approved format) | [ ] |
| As-built drawings: CAD (DWG+PDF) for electrical/mechanical/plumbing; PDF for others | [ ] |
| Product warranties and guarantee certificates provided and assigned to Owner | [ ] |
| O&M includes testing certificates, supplier contacts, start-up reports | [ ] |

**Output:** Draft narrative section (2–4 pages).

### Step 7A — Draft Completeness Gate (Enrichment ref: D-002)

**Action:**
Before proceeding to full QA/QC review, perform a brief completeness gate to confirm the draft narrative addresses all minimum required elements. This prevents rework by catching structural omissions before detailed review.

1. Verify that the draft narrative contains content addressing each of the five Substantial Performance trigger documents (RFP §7.5):
   - [ ] Occupancy Permit procurement process described
   - [ ] Final commissioning documents production described
   - [ ] O&M manuals content, format, and delivery described
   - [ ] As-built drawings scope, format, and delivery described
   - [ ] Legal survey coordination acknowledged (cross-reference to DEL-10-02)

2. Verify that each major narrative section from Step 7 (Introduction, Commissioning Approach, Training Program, O&M Manuals, As-Built Drawings, Product Warranties, Deficiency Closeout, Warranty Period Support) has substantive content (not just placeholder headings).

3. If any element is missing or empty, return to Step 7 to address the gap before proceeding.

**Output:** Completeness confirmation; draft ready for full QA/QC review.

---

### Step 8 — QA/QC Review and Cross-Deliverable Consistency

**Action:**
1. **Compliance check:** Verify all R-001 through R-016 requirements from Specification are addressed.

2. **Consistency check across PKG-008:**
   - DEL-08-01 narrative must not contradict DEL-08-02 (deficiency management) or DEL-08-03 (warranty terms)
   - Terminology consistent: "Substantial Performance," "Final Completion Date," "Warranty Period," "Occupancy Permit"
   - 12-month warranty period start date consistent across DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, and DEL-08-03

3. **Consistency check across proposal:**
   - As-built drawing commitments consistent with design delivery (DEL-06-02)
   - Training approach consistent with operations-awareness stated in durability narratives (DEL-05-xx)
   - Commissioning timeline consistent with project schedule (DEL-09-01)

4. **Credibility check:** Does the narrative demonstrate specific knowledge of the Penhold PSB context (Fire Hall + Public Works; specialized systems; 50-year / 20-year design lives)?

5. Revise based on review findings. Document any unresolvable conflicts in the Conflict Table in Guidance.md.

**Output:** Reviewed and revised narrative section.

---

### Step 9 — Final Integration and Closure

**Action:**
1. Insert finalized narrative into the proposal at the location responding to RFP §7.3.6.

2. Confirm the five Substantial Performance trigger documents (per RFP §7.5) are recognized in the narrative and that the Design-Builder's commitments are clearly tied to delivering all five before claiming Substantial Performance.

3. Confirm status of open items from Conflict Table (CFT-08-01-A, CFT-08-01-B, CFT-08-01-C) — either resolved in narrative or escalated to human author for ruling.

4. Mark deliverable as ready for editorial review.

**Output:** Finalized, integrated narrative ready for proposal submission.
