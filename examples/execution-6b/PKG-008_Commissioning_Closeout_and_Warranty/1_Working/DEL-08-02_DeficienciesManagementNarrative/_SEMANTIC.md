# Deliverable: DEL-08-02 Deficiencies Management Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to articulate the structured process by which construction deficiencies are identified, valued, tracked on a single consolidated register, and resolved to contractual satisfaction across the phases of substantial performance, post-occupancy addition, and warranty-period review. It must carry the knowledge needed to demonstrate transparent accountability from punch list initiation through final closeout, including the financial protection mechanisms that govern holdback and payment during deficiency resolution.
