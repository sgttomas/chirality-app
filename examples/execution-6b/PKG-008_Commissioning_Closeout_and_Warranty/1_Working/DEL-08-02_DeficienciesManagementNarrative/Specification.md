## Scope

**What this deliverable covers:**
- The Design-Builder's structured deficiency management process from end of construction through Substantial Performance, 12-month warranty period review, and final resolution
- Trade punch list protocol, formal deficiency review, comprehensive inspection, and monetary valuation methodology
- Substantial Performance calculation, Owner's 2.5x deficiency holdback right, and holdback release conditions
- Payment Certifier's independent fund retention obligation from progress draws
- Single consolidated deficiency list management and Owner's 6-week post-occupancy deficiency addition right
- 12-month warranty period review process, outstanding warranty issue documentation, and SC54–SC55 obligations
- Integration with commissioning (DEL-08-01) and warranty enforcement (DEL-08-03) processes

**What this deliverable does NOT cover:**
- Commissioning methodology and system operational handover — scope of DEL-08-01 (RFP 7.3.6)
- Warranty enforcement mechanisms, claim procedures, or post-warranty legal obligations — scope of DEL-08-03 (RFP 7.6)
- Construction QA/QC daily site inspections during construction — scope of DEL-07-02 (RFP 7.3)
- Defect definition or liability standards beyond narrative summary — stated in CCDC 14-2013 and Appendix J; narrative incorporates by reference

**Terminology note:** Throughout this specification, "deficiency" refers to any item failing to meet contract documents, applicable codes, or the OSR (used during the formal closeout process per RFP 7.3.7). "Defect" has a specific contractual meaning under SC54 (Appendix J, p.71) referring to warranty-period obligations. See Guidance P-007 for the detailed vocabulary distinction. (Lensing item B-002)
