## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-condition: Trade punch lists** | Design-Builder establishes trade punch lists and submits them prior to confirming building readiness for formal deficiency review | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Pre-condition: Formal Deficiency Meeting** | A formal Deficiency Meeting must be held to agree on approach and review dates before comprehensive inspection proceeds | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Monetary valuation required** | Each deficiency item must have a monetary value assigned; values compared with Substantial Performance calculation including approved change orders before Substantial Performance is claimed | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Substantial Performance documents** | Work shall not be considered fit for intended use until Owner receives: Occupancy Permit, final commissioning documents, all O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, Legal Survey | RFP 7.5, p.24 |
| **Terminology: "Deficiency" vs. "Defect"** | **"Deficiency"** refers to any item failing to meet contract documents, applicable codes, or the OSR; used during the formal closeout process (RFP 7.3.7). **"Defect"** has a specific contractual meaning under SC54 (Appendix J, p.71) and refers to warranty-period obligations under CCDC 14-2013 as modified. During the 12-month warranty period, items may be both deficiencies (on the consolidated list) and defects (triggering SC54-SC55 obligations). See Guidance P-007 and Procedure Step 3, item 4 for the detailed terminology guide. (Lensing item B-002) | Appendix J SC54 (p.71); RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Guidance P-007 |
| **Defect definition (SC54)** | "Defect" excludes imperfections naturally following misuse, failure to perform recommended maintenance, accident, or normal wear and tear. Manufactured items must be capable of specified use for the full warranty duration; failure to comply = defect | Appendix J SC54 (p.71) |
| **Cost of investigations** | All costs of investigations, tests, repairs and/or replacement, and making good any resulting damage shall be borne by the Design-Builder | Appendix J SC54.2 (p.71) |
| **Corrective work timing** | Corrective, remedial, or replacement Work executed at times convenient for the Owner (may entail overtime at Design-Builder's cost); Owner may carry out detailed and exhaustive inspection prior to warranty expiry | Appendix J SC54.3 (p.71) |
| **Excessive servicing = defect** | Material or equipment requiring excessive servicing during warranty period is deemed defective; warranty (or free maintenance period) restarts from time defect is corrected | Appendix J SC55 / GC 12.5.9 (p.72) |
| **Repair commencement timeline** | Design-Builder shall commence repairs on Work identified as defective within 20 working days of receipt of notice from Owner | Appendix J SC55 / GC 12.5.10 (p.72) |
| **Scope boundary** | Covers deficiency management from end of construction through 12-month warranty review and final resolution; excludes commissioning methodology (DEL-08-01) and warranty enforcement mechanisms (DEL-08-03) | Deliverable context |
| **Coordination with DEL-08-01** | Deficiency review begins after commissioning completion; commissioning agent may be available for system-level deficiency assessment | RFP 7.3.6–7.3.7, p.22–23 |
| **Coordination with DEL-08-03** | 12-month warranty period deficiencies and SC54–SC55 provisions align with DEL-08-03 warranty obligations | RFP 7.6, p.25; Appendix J SC54–SC55 |

## Construction

| Component | Details | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1: Trade punch lists** | Design-Builder establishes trade-level punch lists; submits prior to confirming building readiness for formal deficiency review | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Phase 2: Formal Deficiency Meeting** | Design-Builder holds formal meeting with Owner to agree on deficiency review approach and scheduling dates | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Phase 3: Comprehensive inspection** | Complete inspection of all construction work; comprehensive deficiency list prepared with monetary values assigned to each item for comparison with Substantial Performance calculation (including approved change orders) | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Phase 4: Substantial Performance claim** | Monetary values compared against Substantial Performance calculation; Owner asserts holdback right (up to 2.5x deficiency value); holdback payment submitted to Owner for review and acceptance | RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC36 |
| **Phase 5: Single consolidated list** | One unified list combining Design-Builder's identified deficiencies and Owner's identified deficiencies | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Phase 6: Owner 6-week addition window** | Owner may add deficiencies up to 6 weeks after occupancy; same resolution process applies; Payment Certifier retains sufficient progress draw funds for coverage | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 |
| **Phase 7: Resolution** | All deficiencies corrected expeditiously to satisfaction of Owner and OSR; prerequisite for claiming total completion and final payment; Design-Builder commences repairs within 20 working days of notice from Owner | RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC55 / GC 12.5.10 |
| **Phase 8: 12-month warranty review** | At end of warranty period, Design-Builder conducts review and prepares list of outstanding warranty issues; excessive servicing items deemed defective with warranty restart | RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC55 / GC 12.5.9 |
| **Key assumptions** | **ASSUMPTION:** Monetary valuation follows standard repair/replacement cost methodology (labour + materials + overhead). **ASSUMPTION:** Comprehensive inspection means systematic building-wide walkthrough with documented punch list. **ASSUMPTION:** Post-occupancy 6-week window commences from occupancy permit issuance date. **ASSUMPTION:** "Excessive servicing" threshold to be defined in the operational deficiency register (no specific threshold given in SC55); Specification R-18 requires the narrative to either define this threshold or explicitly identify it as a project-specific determination with a stated resolution pathway (Lensing item A-001). Deficiency forms/templates to be finalized before Procedure Step 6 activation (Lensing item A-002; see Specification Documentation table for template milestone requirements). | |
