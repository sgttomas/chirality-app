## Steps

### Step 1: Establish RFP Compliance Map and Narrative Outline (2–4 hours)

**Action:**

1. Extract and list all explicit requirements from RFP Section 7.3.7 (p.23). The complete requirement set — 8 bullet points plus the post-occupancy paragraph and Payment Certifier sentence — is:

   | # | Requirement (verbatim from RFP 7.3.7, p.23) |
   |---|---|
   | 1 | Establish the necessary trade punch lists and submit prior to confirming that the building is ready for a formal deficiency review |
   | 2 | Hold a formal Deficiency Meeting to discuss and agree to the approach and dates which the deficiency review(s) will take place |
   | 3 | Undertake a complete inspection of the construction work and prepare a comprehensive list of all deficiencies prior to claiming Substantial Performance of the Project with monetary values assigned to each of the remaining and deficient items for comparison with the calculation of Substantial Performance including approved change orders |
   | 4 | The Owner may retain up to 2.5 times the value of the calculated deficiency cost until all deficiencies are corrected, unless otherwise agreed to by the Owner |
   | 5 | Conduct a 12-month warranty period review and prepare a list of outstanding warranty issues |
   | 6 | Generate a single deficiency list for the Project and it is to include the Design-Builder's deficiencies and the Owner's identified deficiencies |
   | 7 | Ensure all deficiencies are corrected expeditiously and to the satisfaction of the Owner and the OSR prior to claiming total completion and final payment |
   | POST | The Owner reserves the right to add any additional deficiencies to the list up to six (6) weeks after occupancy and these deficiencies are to follow the same process for resolution |
   | PC | The Payment Certifier will retain sufficient funds from progress draws to cover the completion of unfinished and deficient work |

2. Map each requirement to a narrative section:

   | Narrative Section | Content | Maps to Requirement(s) |
   |---|---|---|
   | Section A: Overview | What deficiency management is; lifecycle context; distinction from QA/QC | Context |
   | Section B: Trade Punch List Protocol | Initiation, format, distribution, sign-off | Req #1 |
   | Section C: Formal Deficiency Meeting | Participants, agenda, scheduling, decision authority | Req #2 |
   | Section D: Comprehensive Inspection | Scope, methodology, documentation | Req #3 |
   | Section E: Monetary Valuation | Cost basis, process, Owner review, Substantial Performance linkage | Req #3 |
   | Section F: Substantial Performance, Holdback, and Payment Certifier | SP definition, Owner 2.5x right, holdback release, Payment Certifier retention | Req #4, PC; SC36 |
   | Section G: Single Consolidated Deficiency List | Format, versioning, stakeholder access, change control | Req #6 |
   | Section H: Owner Post-Occupancy Addition Right | 6-week window, process, incorporation, deadline enforcement | Req POST |
   | Section I: Resolution Timeline and Closeout | Categories, re-inspection, sign-off, final closeout, Total Completion | Req #7; SC5 |
   | Section J: 12-Month Warranty Period Review and SC54–SC55 | Timing, scope, outstanding issues list, excessive servicing, 20-WD commencement | Req #5; SC54–SC55 |

3. Create outline document with section headings and key content bullets for each section.
4. Circulate outline to Commissioning Lead, Construction Manager, and Quality Lead before drafting.

**Output:** Narrative outline (1–2 pages) with section structure, complete RFP requirement map, and key content bullets.

---

### Step 2: Draft Deficiency Process Narrative (6–10 hours)

**Action:**

1. **Section A (Overview):** Introduce deficiency management as a formal documented process at project closeout. Position timeline: follows commissioning completion (DEL-08-01); runs in parallel with 12-month warranty period (DEL-08-03); leads to Total Completion of the Work and final payment (SC5 definition). Distinguish from daily QA/QC (DEL-07-02). Reference RFP 7.3.7, p.23 as governing requirement.

2. **Section B (Trade Punch List Protocol):** Describe initiation: when construction is substantially complete and systems are commissioned, Design-Builder establishes trade punch lists and submits them to confirm the building is ready for formal deficiency review (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). Describe format (standardized form with Item #, Location, Description, Trade Responsible, Priority level). Distribution: Design-Builder team, PM, Owner. Sign-off: preliminary punch list signed by PM and Owner; becomes baseline for formal deficiency review.

3. **Section C (Formal Deficiency Meeting):** Describe meeting purpose — to discuss and agree on approach and dates for deficiency review(s) (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). Participants: PM, Design-Builder PM/QA Lead, Owner PM, Owner Representative. Agenda items: review punch list; confirm deficiency criteria (vs. contract documents, OSR, and applicable codes); assign trade responsibility and resolution timelines; establish monetary valuation process and who reviews; confirm consolidated list format and access. Minutes signed by PM and Owner; serve as basis for the consolidated deficiency list.

4. **Section D (Comprehensive Inspection):** Describe systematic walkthrough of all construction work (interior and exterior, all systems, all finishes, all visible structural elements, all site work). Methodology: structured room-by-room and system-by-system walk using checklist of common deficiency types by trade. Commissioning agent available for mechanical/electrical system-level items. Documentation: photographs and written notes for all items; compiled into deficiency inspection report distributed to all parties.

5. **Section E (Monetary Valuation):** Define monetary valuation as the cost to repair or replace each deficiency item. Cost basis: Labour (skilled trade rate × estimated hours) + Materials (replacement cost) + Overhead/Profit (proportional percentage per trade standard). Process: Design-Builder QA Lead or trade supervisor estimates costs; PM reviews for reasonableness; Owner receives and may challenge items. Final agreed values entered into consolidated deficiency list. State currency (CAD). State Substantial Performance linkage: monetary values are compared against the calculation of Substantial Performance including approved change orders (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). Note: Design-Builder bears all costs of investigations, tests, and repairs under SC54.2 (Appendix J, p.71).

6. **Section F (Substantial Performance, Holdback, and Payment Certifier):** Define Substantial Performance: Work is safe, functional, and fit for intended use; requires Occupancy Permit, final commissioning docs, O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, and Legal Survey received by Owner (RFP 7.5, p.24). Describe Owner's 2.5x holdback right: Owner may retain up to 2.5 times the value of the calculated deficiency cost until all deficiencies are corrected, unless otherwise agreed by the Owner (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). State that Substantial Performance holdback payment is submitted to Owner for review and acceptance (SC36, Appendix J, p.67). Note: statutory holdback rate for this project is 2% (SC3, Appendix J, p.61). Separately, state that the Payment Certifier will retain sufficient funds from progress draws to cover completion of unfinished and deficient work (RFP 7.3.7, p.23) — this is an independent financial protection mechanism. Describe Owner's election: Owner may choose to fund remediation from holdback, defer to warranty obligation, or a combination.

7. **Section G (Single Consolidated Deficiency List):** State the RFP requirement explicitly — a single deficiency list combining the Design-Builder's deficiencies and the Owner's identified deficiencies (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). Describe format (master register: Item #, Location, Description, Trade, Status, Monetary Value, Date Added, Added By, Sign-off Date, Closed Date). Versioning: dated; revisions numbered; all parties receive updates promptly. Stakeholder access: PM maintains master; copies to Owner, Design-Builder Field PM, and trade supervisors. Change control: new items added only within permitted windows; completed items signed off and marked Closed with date; no items removed without Owner approval.

8. **Section H (Owner Post-Occupancy Addition Right):** State that the Owner reserves the right to add additional deficiencies to the list up to 6 weeks after occupancy, following the same process for resolution (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). Process: Owner submits in writing to PM within the 6-week window; Design-Builder and PM evaluate against contract documents, OSR, and applicable codes; approved items added to consolidated list with unique item number and "Owner-Post-Occupancy" flag. PM issues written reminder to Owner at week 5. Deadline at end of week 6 is firm — enables Design-Builder to finalize warranty commitment scope and initiate holdback release process.

9. **Section I (Resolution Timeline and Closeout):** Categorize deficiency resolution timelines:
   - Critical (safety/life-safety/code compliance): Resolved before Substantial Performance; target 5–15 working days.
   - Major (functional/system performance): Resolved within 15–30 working days; if not resolved before Substantial Performance, deferred to warranty with holdback applied.
   - Minor/Cosmetic: Target 30–60 working days; typically deferred within warranty period.
   Describe resolution process: Trade executes remediation; notifies PM; PM schedules re-inspection within 3 working days; Owner inspects and signs off; item marked Closed on consolidated list with date. Note the 20-working-day repair commencement obligation: Design-Builder shall commence repairs within 20 working days of receipt of notice from Owner (SC55/GC 12.5.10, Appendix J, p.72). Final closeout: all items Closed or formally transitioned to warranty obligations register; final closeout meeting; holdback released or final invoice issued; deficiency register archived. State: all deficiencies corrected expeditiously to the satisfaction of the Owner and the OSR prior to claiming total completion and final payment (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). "Total Completion of the Work" per SC5 means the entire Work performed in accordance with Contract Documents, except items arising from GC 12.3-WARRANTY.

10. **Section J (12-Month Warranty Period Review and SC54–SC55 Obligations):** Describe the formal 12-month warranty period review (RFP 7.3.7, p.23): timing (at or before month 12 from occupancy permit date per RFP 7.6, p.25); scope (all deficiencies and warranty issues arising during the warranty term). Output: list of outstanding warranty issues. Reference SC54–SC55 obligations (Appendix J, p.71–72) explicitly:
    - SC54.1: Manufactured items must perform for the full warranty duration; failure = defect.
    - SC54.2: All costs of investigations, tests, repairs, and/or replacement borne by Design-Builder.
    - SC54.3: Corrective work at times convenient to the Owner; may include overtime at Design-Builder's cost.
    - SC54.4: Owner may carry out detailed and exhaustive inspection before warranty expiry.
    - SC55/GC 12.5.9: Material or equipment requiring excessive servicing during warranty period is deemed defective; warranty restarts from the time the defect is corrected.
    - SC55/GC 12.5.10: Design-Builder shall commence repairs within 20 working days of receipt of notice from Owner.
    Design-Builder commits to resolving all outstanding warranty issues before warranty expiry and documenting any unresolved items on the outstanding warranty issues list per RFP 7.3.7, p.23.

**Output:** Full draft narrative (~1,500–2,500 words, or as appropriate for any RFP page limits).

---

### Step 3: Align with Related Deliverables (1–2 hours)

**Action:**

1. Cross-reference with DEL-08-01 (Commissioning): Confirm deficiency management begins after commissioning completion; commissioning agent is available during deficiency inspection for system-level assessments. Verify that the handoff point (commissioning complete → deficiency review begins) is consistent across both narratives. Check that O&M manuals, commissioning docs, and As-Built Drawings sequence (required for Substantial Performance per RFP 7.5, p.24) is reflected.

2. Cross-reference with DEL-08-03 (Warranty): Confirm that warranty period deficiency obligations in Section J above are consistent with warranty provisions in DEL-08-03. Verify SC54–SC55 obligations (cost of investigations, corrective work timing, excessive servicing provision, 20-working-day commencement) are aligned and not contradictory between both narratives.

3. Cross-reference with DEL-09-01 (Schedule): Verify that deficiency management milestones (punch list, formal meeting, Substantial Performance, 6-week window, 12-month review) are reflected in or compatible with the project Gantt. Resolution timelines (5–60 working days by category; 20-WD commencement under SC55) should be achievable within the project schedule context.

4. Terminology consistency check:
   - Use "Owner" consistently — SC5 (Appendix J, p.61) defines "Town of Penhold" as having the same definition as "Owner."
   - Use "Design-Builder" consistently.
   - Use "deficiency" consistently for items failing to meet contract documents/OSR/codes; use "defect" when referencing SC54 warranty obligations (per CCDC 14-2013 language as modified by Appendix J).
   - Use "Total Completion of the Work" per SC5 definition (not "final completion" or "project completion" as interchangeable terms).

5. Circulate cross-reference notes to Commissioning Lead, Construction Manager, PM, and Quality Lead.

**Output:** Revised narrative incorporating cross-document alignment corrections.

---

### Step 4: Integrate Contract References and Final Compliance Verification (1–2 hours)

**Action:**

1. Add explicit references to all governing contract documents:
   - RFP Section 7.3.7 (p.23) — primary governing requirement.
   - RFP Section 7.5 (p.24) — Substantial Performance documents.
   - RFP Section 7.6 (p.25) — 12-month all-inclusive warranty.
   - Appendix J SC1 (p.61) — 10% retention; prompt payment.
   - Appendix J SC3 (p.61) — statutory holdback 2%.
   - Appendix J SC5 (p.61) — "Total Completion" definition; "Owner" = Town of Penhold.
   - Appendix J SC36 (p.67) — Substantial Performance holdback payment submitted to Owner for review and acceptance.
   - Appendix J SC53 (p.70) — 50% Labour/Materials Bond + 50% Performance Bond.
   - Appendix J SC54 (p.71) — warranty/defect provisions; Design-Builder bears costs.
   - Appendix J SC55/GC 12.5.9–12.5.10 (p.72) — excessive servicing = defect; 20-WD commencement.
   - CCDC 14-2013 — base contract form; Substantial Performance, defect, warranty provisions.

2. Verify that the narrative explicitly addresses ALL requirements from RFP 7.3.7 (p.23):
   - [ ] Trade punch lists established and submitted before confirming readiness for formal review
   - [ ] Formal Deficiency Meeting — approach and dates agreed
   - [ ] Comprehensive inspection — monetary values assigned per item; compared with Substantial Performance calculation including approved change orders
   - [ ] Owner 2.5x holdback right stated with correct language
   - [ ] 12-month warranty period review — outstanding issues list prepared
   - [ ] Single consolidated deficiency list — Design-Builder's + Owner's deficiencies
   - [ ] Expeditious resolution to satisfaction of Owner and OSR before total completion and final payment
   - [ ] Owner 6-week post-occupancy addition right — same resolution process
   - [ ] Payment Certifier retains sufficient progress draw funds
   - [ ] SC54 obligations addressed (cost of investigations, corrective work timing)
   - [ ] SC55 provisions addressed (excessive servicing = defect; warranty restart; 20-WD commencement)

3. Add closing paragraph affirming Design-Builder's commitment to transparent, fair, and thorough deficiency management aligned to contract requirements and Owner's operational objectives for the Public Services Building.

**Output:** Final narrative draft with complete contract citations and compliance checklist confirmed.

---

### Step 5: QA Review, Formatting, and Submission Preparation (1–2 hours)

**Action:**

1. Internal QA review (PM): Check for clarity, completeness (all RFP 7.3.7 and SC54–SC55 requirements covered), consistency (terminology, timeline, cost methodology aligned), and realism (timelines achievable given project context; 20-WD commencement practical given Penhold trade availability).

2. Proposal formatting: Verify writing style matches other proposal narrative sections; confirm any tables use proposal template formatting; remove sensitive cost data (use generic ranges: e.g., "skilled trade rate plus overhead and profit" rather than specific dollar rates).

3. Length check: Trim if necessary to fit within any page limits specified in RFP Section 4.3 or 7.3.7; prioritize coverage of all required elements.

4. Stakeholder sign-off: Circulate final narrative to Commissioning Lead, Construction Manager, PM, and Quality Lead; document sign-off for proposal records.

5. Convert to PDF for final proposal; confirm searchable text; add page numbers per RFP format standards.

**Output:** Final approved narrative ready for inclusion in the proposal PDF (Section 7.3.7 response).

---

### Step 6 (Operational): Activate Deficiency Process at Construction Closeout

**Action (during construction phase):**

1. When construction is substantially complete and systems have been commissioned (DEL-08-01), activate the deficiency process per the narrative:
   - Issue trade punch lists; obtain PM and Owner preliminary sign-off.
   - Schedule and hold Formal Deficiency Meeting; distribute and execute minutes.
   - Execute comprehensive inspection; assign monetary values; generate deficiency inspection report.
   - Calculate Substantial Performance deficiency holdback (monetary total × 2.5); submit to Owner for review and acceptance (SC36).
   - Generate single consolidated deficiency list; distribute to all parties.

2. Assign each item a priority category (Critical / Major / Minor) and resolution timeline.

3. Issue formal deficiency notices to responsible trades; initiate the 20-working-day commencement clock per SC55/GC 12.5.10.

**Output:** Active consolidated deficiency register; Substantial Performance holdback amount confirmed with Owner.

---

### Step 7 (Operational): Manage Active Deficiency Resolution

**Action (during construction closeout and early warranty period):**

1. Track all deficiency items against consolidated register; update status weekly.
2. Schedule re-inspections within 3 working days of trade completion notification.
3. Facilitate Owner sign-off on each resolved item; mark Closed with date.
4. Monitor 6-week post-occupancy window; issue week-5 reminder to Owner.
5. Process any Owner post-occupancy additions; incorporate into consolidated list with "Owner-Post-Occupancy" flag.
6. Initiate partial holdback releases as deficiency categories are resolved; submit each release to Owner for review and acceptance per SC36.
7. **Dispute Escalation** (Lensing item D-001): If the Owner and Design-Builder disagree on whether an item constitutes a deficiency, or on the monetary valuation of a deficiency item:
   - Step 7a: PM documents the disputed item with both parties' positions and supporting evidence (photographs, contract references, specifications).
   - Step 7b: PM, acting in the Owner's Advisor role per SC13.2.3.5.1 (Appendix J), reviews the evidence and makes a finding in first instance.
   - Step 7c: If either party rejects the PM's finding, the dispute is escalated to the contract authority (per CCDC 14-2013 dispute resolution provisions as modified by Appendix J).
   - Step 7d: Contested items remain on the consolidated deficiency list with "DISPUTED" status and are treated at full estimated value in the holdback calculation until resolved (see Specification R-17; Guidance T-004).

**Output:** Deficiency register with progressive closure of items; partial holdback releases documented.

---

### Step 8 (Operational): 12-Month Warranty Period Review

**Action (at or before month 12 from occupancy permit date):**

1. Conduct systematic 12-month warranty review walkthrough (all systems, all spaces, all finishes, site work) with Owner and PM.
2. Flag any items meeting SC55/GC 12.5.9 excessive servicing criteria; classify as defects; restart warranty period for those items.
3. Issue formal written notices for all identified defects (triggers 20-WD commencement clock per SC55/GC 12.5.10).
4. Prepare list of outstanding warranty issues per RFP 7.3.7, p.23.
5. Execute all repairs and remediation before warranty expiry; obtain Owner sign-off.
6. Archive final deficiency register and outstanding warranty issues list for contract records.

**Output:** Outstanding warranty issues list; all items resolved or documented; warranty period closed.
