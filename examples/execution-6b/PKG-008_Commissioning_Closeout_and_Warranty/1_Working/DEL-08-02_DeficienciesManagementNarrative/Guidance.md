# Guidance — Deficiencies Management Narrative

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-08-02
**Type:** Commissioning / Narrative
**Audience:** Design-Builder proposal team (primary internal reference); Owner Evaluation Committee (evaluates the produced narrative)

---

## Purpose

**Why this deliverable exists:**

RFP Section 7.3.7 (p.23) requires the Design-Builder to describe a credible, transparent deficiency management process as part of the overall project delivery methodology. This narrative serves three critical purposes:

1. **Compliance:** Directly addresses RFP Section 7.3.7 mandatory content; contributes to OBJ-002 (Project Delivery Plan evaluation, commissioning/training/closeout sub-criterion = 2 pts per RFP p.26, shared across DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, DEL-08-03).

2. **Owner Confidence:** Demonstrates that the Design-Builder understands:
   - The distinction between construction QA/QC (ongoing site quality, DEL-07-02/07-05) and post-construction deficiency management (end-of-project structured closeout, this deliverable);
   - The Owner's contractual rights — 2.5x holdback up to deficiency correction, 6-week post-occupancy addition window (both in RFP 7.3.7, p.23);
   - The 12-month warranty period as a distinct, formal review and resolution phase (RFP 7.3.7, p.23; RFP 7.6, p.25);
   - The role of monetary valuation and Substantial Performance calculation (including approved change orders) in deficiency prioritization and holdback determination;
   - The Payment Certifier's independent obligation to retain progress draw funds for unfinished and deficient work (RFP 7.3.7, p.23);
   - The SC54 and SC55 warranty obligations (Appendix J, p.71–72): Design-Builder bears cost of investigations, corrective work is at Owner's convenience, excessive servicing equals defect, 20-working-day repair commencement.

3. **Internal Framework:** Gives the proposal team a shared operational understanding of the deficiency process to be implemented during construction, enabling realistic cost and schedule allocation.

## Principles

**P-001: Transparency and Accountability**
All punch lists are documented, shared among stakeholders, and tracked through the process. Monetary valuations follow a consistent, defensible cost methodology. The single consolidated deficiency list (per RFP 7.3.7, p.23) ensures all parties see the same information. Owner, Design-Builder, PM, and Payment Certifier have clear, distinct roles throughout. No deficiency item should be closed without written sign-off by the Owner or PM.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23.

**P-002: Structured Timing**
Deficiency identification and formal review are sequential, not ad-hoc: trade punch lists first; formal Deficiency Meeting second; comprehensive inspection and valuation third. The 12-month warranty period review is scheduled and formal. The Owner's 6-week post-occupancy addition window is a defined, time-limited right (not an open-ended obligation). The 20-working-day repair commencement obligation (SC55/GC 12.5.10) provides a firm trigger for action during the warranty term.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC55/GC 12.5.10, p.72.

**P-003: Financial Clarity**
Monetary valuation drives the holdback calculation (up to 2.5x deficiency value) and Owner's decision on how to fund resolution. Two parallel financial protection mechanisms exist: (a) Owner's 2.5x holdback right per RFP 7.3.7, and (b) Payment Certifier's independent retention of progress draw funds per RFP 7.3.7. Additionally, the statutory holdback rate for this project is modified to 2% (SC3) and the 10% retention on progress claims (SC1) provides further security. The Design-Builder bears all costs of investigations, tests, and repairs under SC54.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC1, SC3, SC54, p.61, p.71.

**P-004: Warranty Alignment**
Deficiency process and warranty period operate in parallel after occupancy. Deficiencies discovered during the 12-month warranty term are warranty obligations governed by SC54–SC55 (Appendix J):
- Cost of investigations, tests, repairs, and replacement borne by Design-Builder (SC54.2);
- Corrective work at times convenient for Owner, including overtime at Design-Builder's cost (SC54.3);
- Owner may conduct detailed and exhaustive inspection before warranty expiry (SC54.4);
- Excessive servicing = defect; warranty restarts from time defect corrected (SC55/GC 12.5.9);
- Repairs commenced within 20 working days of Owner notice (SC55/GC 12.5.10).
Source: Appendix J SC54–SC55, p.71–72; RFP 7.3.7, p.23; RFP 7.6, p.25.

**P-005: OSR Compliance as Resolution Standard**
Deficiencies are not resolved until both the Owner and the OSR (Owner's Statement of Requirements) are satisfied — per RFP 7.3.7, p.23: "to the satisfaction of the Owner and the OSR prior to claiming total completion and final payment." This is a higher standard than merely completing the physical repair; the repair must meet the original functional intent. "Total Completion of the Work" is defined in SC5 as the entire Work performed in accordance with Contract Documents, except items arising from GC 12.3-WARRANTY.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC5, p.61.

**P-006: Single Consolidated List**
The RFP requires a single deficiency list combining Design-Builder's and Owner's deficiencies (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). This is an explicit requirement, not an option. The narrative must describe how this unified list is generated, maintained, and updated through the lifecycle of deficiency resolution. Maintaining a single master list prevents parallel or competing registers that lead to items being missed, re-opened, or disputed.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23.

**P-007: Formal Vocabulary — "Deficiency" vs. "Defect"**
Throughout these documents, the following terminology distinction applies (Lensing item B-002):
- **"Deficiency"** refers to any item failing to meet contract documents, applicable codes, or the OSR. This is the general term used during the formal closeout process (RFP 7.3.7) covering pre-warranty items on the consolidated list.
- **"Defect"** has a specific contractual meaning under SC54 (Appendix J, p.71) and refers to warranty-period obligations under CCDC 14-2013 as modified. SC54 excludes imperfections from misuse, failure to perform recommended maintenance, accident, or normal wear and tear.
- During the 12-month warranty period, items may be both "deficiencies" (on the consolidated list) and "defects" (triggering SC54-SC55 obligations). The Procedure (Step 3, item 4) provides a detailed terminology guide.

## Considerations

**C-001: Deficiency vs. QA/QC Distinction**
The RFP distinguishes construction QA/QC (continuous, daily site inspections per DEL-07-02) from deficiency management (end-of-project formal closeout per DEL-08-02). A well-executed QA/QC program reduces the deficiency list at closeout, but some items are inevitable on any construction project. The narrative should clarify that deficiency management is the formal structured process after systems are commissioned and the building is substantially complete — not a catch-all for construction oversight failures.

**C-002: Punch List Scope and Owner Expectations**
Punch lists can vary in interpretive rigor. The narrative should clarify that "deficiency" refers to items failing to meet contract documents, applicable codes, or the OSR. Cosmetic preferences that do not affect function, safety, or compliance with the contract standard are not deficiencies per se. The Owner has the right to raise items during the deficiency review and 6-week post-occupancy windows; the Design-Builder and PM evaluate each item against the contract standard. The SC54 defect definition (Appendix J, p.71) explicitly excludes normal wear and tear, misuse, and failure to perform recommended maintenance.

**C-003: Monetary Valuation Methodology**
"Monetary valuation" means estimating the cost to repair or replace each deficiency item. This drives the holdback calculation and Substantial Performance determination. The valuation approach must be defensible and transparent.
- Valuation basis: Labour (skilled trade rate × estimated hours) + Materials (replacement cost) + Overhead/Profit (proportional percentage per trade standard).
- Who performs: Design-Builder QA Lead or trade supervisor estimates; PM reviews; Owner receives and may challenge high-cost items.
- Currency: All costs in CAD.
- ASSUMPTION: No contingency applied to deficiency repair costs (costs are firm estimates at time of valuation).
- Note: SC54.2 (Appendix J, p.71) confirms that all costs of investigations, tests, repairs, and replacement are borne by the Design-Builder — not the Owner.

**C-004: Substantial Performance vs. Final Completion**
Substantial Performance is a contract milestone enabling Owner occupancy and triggering the 12-month warranty period. It does NOT require all deficiencies to be resolved. The narrative should clarify:
- Substantial Performance = Work is safe, functional, and suitable for intended use (per CCDC 14-2013), with Occupancy Permit, final commissioning docs, O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, and Legal Survey received by Owner (RFP 7.5, p.24), even if minor deficiencies remain.
- Major deficiencies (impairing function, safety, or code compliance) should be resolved before Substantial Performance.
- Minor/cosmetic deficiencies may be deferred within the warranty period; Design-Builder commits to a documented resolution timeline.
- "Total Completion of the Work" per SC5 (Appendix J, p.61) = all Work complete, except items arising from GC 12.3-WARRANTY provisions.
Source: RFP 7.5, p.24; RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC5, p.61.

**C-005: Owner's 2.5x Holdback Right — Dual Protection Mechanism**
The Owner's 2.5x holdback right (RFP 7.3.7, p.23) is a contractual risk mitigation tool supplementing the statutory holdback framework (SC3 sets rate at 2%) and the Payment Certifier's independent retention obligation. The narrative should:
- Explain the calculation (total deficiency valuation × 2.5 = holdback amount, subject to "unless otherwise agreed by the Owner" discretion);
- Acknowledge Owner's election right (use holdback funds vs. defer to warranty obligation);
- Confirm Design-Builder accepts this contractual right and supports it with a fair, transparent valuation process;
- Note the Substantial Performance holdback payment is subject to Owner review and acceptance (SC36, Appendix J, p.67).
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC3, SC36, p.61, p.67.

**C-006: Payment Certifier Retention — Independent Obligation**
Separately from the Owner's 2.5x holdback right, the Payment Certifier has an independent obligation to retain sufficient funds from progress draws to cover unfinished and deficient work (RFP 7.3.7, p.23). The narrative should acknowledge this dual financial protection mechanism — both the Owner's 2.5x holdback and the Payment Certifier's retention serve the same ultimate purpose (ensuring funds to complete deficiency resolution) but operate independently. Design-Builder cannot control Payment Certifier retention decisions; the best mitigation is a short deficiency list at Substantial Performance.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Appendix J SC1, p.61.

**C-007: 12-Month Warranty Period and Deficiency Overlap**
The 12-month warranty period (from occupancy permit date, per RFP 7.6, p.25) overlaps with deficiency resolution activity. Key interaction points:
- Deficiencies identified at Substantial Performance may be holdback-funded or deferred to warranty obligation.
- Deficiencies identified DURING the warranty term: Design-Builder bears all costs of investigation and remediation (SC54.2).
- Owner's 6-week post-occupancy addition window (RFP 7.3.7, p.23) falls within the warranty term; items added are incorporated into the consolidated deficiency and warranty process.
- Excessive servicing during the warranty period = defect; warranty restarts from correction date (SC55/GC 12.5.9).
- At 12 months, formal review identifies outstanding warranty issues; items must be resolved before warranty expiry; unresolved items documented on outstanding warranty issues list.
Source: RFP 7.3.7, p.23; RFP 7.6, p.25; Appendix J SC54–SC55, p.71–72.

**C-008: Re-Inspection and Sign-Off Protocol**
Deficiency resolution requires verified proof of completion. The narrative should describe:
- Re-inspection (PM and/or Owner verifies remediation meets contract standard and OSR requirements);
- Sign-off (Owner acknowledges completion and accepts the remediated item; entered as "Closed" on consolidated list with sign-off date);
- Dispute escalation (if Owner rejects sign-off: rework required, re-inspection scheduled, escalation to PM or contract authority if needed).
ASSUMPTION: Joint inspection (Design-Builder + Owner + PM) is preferred for efficiency and dispute avoidance.

**C-009: "Total Completion" Definition and Final Payment**
SC5 (Appendix J, p.61) defines "Total Completion of the Work" as the entire Work performed in accordance with Contract Documents, except items arising from GC 12.3-WARRANTY. This means warranty work items do not block final payment as long as the deficiency register is resolved or appropriately transitioned to warranty obligations. The narrative should clarify the distinction between the deficiency resolution milestone (precondition for total completion claim) and items legitimately transitioning into the warranty obligations register.
Source: Appendix J SC5, p.61; RFP 7.3.7, p.23.

**C-010: Alberta Prompt Payment and Construction Lien Act Interaction** (Lensing item C-001)
The Alberta Prompt Payment and Construction Lien Act is cited as an applicable standard (via SC1, Appendix J, p.61), but its specific interaction with the deficiency holdback and Payment Certifier retention mechanisms requires confirmation. Key questions:
- Does the Act's prompt payment framework affect the Owner's ability to retain the 2.5x deficiency holdback (RFP 7.3.7, p.23) beyond statutory timelines?
- How does the SC1 10% retention interact with the Act's provisions on retention release?
- Are there Act-specific timelines that override or constrain the Owner's election right on holdback release?
**TBD: Confirm which specific Act provisions interact with SC1 retention and 2.5x holdback mechanisms. Flag for Legal review before finalizing narrative language on financial protections.**
Source: Appendix J SC1, p.61; provincial legislation (Alberta Prompt Payment and Construction Lien Act).

**C-011: OBJ-002 Scoring Allocation Strategy** (Lensing item C-002)
The commissioning/training/closeout sub-criterion under OBJ-002 carries 2 points (RFP p.26, Section 8.2 Evaluation Criteria table), shared across DEL-08-01 (Commissioning), DEL-08-02 (Deficiencies Management), and DEL-08-03 (Warranty). No guidance from the RFP specifies how evaluators weight deficiency management relative to commissioning or warranty within this 2-point allocation. **ASSUMPTION: The narrative emphasis strategy should prioritize demonstrating that the Design-Builder understands the Owner's key risk concerns — specifically the 2.5x holdback mechanism, the single consolidated list requirement, and the formal 12-month warranty review — as these represent areas where the Owner has explicitly articulated detailed process expectations.** The depth of RFP 7.3.7 (8 bullets plus supplementary paragraphs) relative to the other PKG-008 scope items suggests the Owner places significant weight on deficiency management rigor.
Source: RFP p.26, Section 8.2; RFP 7.3.7, p.23; Datasheet Identification (Objective Alignment).

**C-012: Holdback Release Mechanism — Cross-Document Alignment** (Lensing item E-001)
The holdback release approach is currently stated inconsistently across documents:
- **Guidance T-002** recommends tranche releases with SC36 Owner review at each release.
- **Procedure Step 7.6** references partial holdback releases as deficiency categories are resolved.
- **Specification R-05** states only the 2.5x retention right without addressing release mechanism.
- **Datasheet Phase 4** mentions submission for Owner review without describing a release schedule.
If the narrative adopts the tranche-release recommendation per T-002, the Specification should include a corresponding requirement defining release triggers, and the Datasheet should reflect the release schedule as an attribute. **TBD: Confirm whether the narrative will adopt the tranche-release approach (T-002) or a single lump-sum release. If tranche release is adopted, update Specification and Datasheet accordingly.**

## Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Proposed Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T-001: Valuation Timing** | Valuations prepared at the Substantial Performance deficiency review (single formal valuation event after comprehensive inspection) | Valuations prepared continuously as deficiencies are identified during construction | Recommend Option A — single formal event provides Owner budget certainty at Substantial Performance and ensures monetary values reflect complete scope of outstanding items |
| **T-002: Holdback Release Schedule** | Release holdback only when all deficiencies are signed off | Release holdback in tranches as deficiency categories are signed off (e.g., all critical/major items signed off → partial release) | Recommend tranche releases for Design-Builder cash flow; define release triggers in narrative; note SC36 requires Owner review and acceptance at each release |
| **T-003: Warranty vs. Holdback Funding** | All deficiencies funded from holdback (Design-Builder executes; costs paid from holdback) | Deficiencies deferred to warranty obligation (Design-Builder executes under warranty; holdback released) | Recommend acknowledging Owner's election right per RFP 7.3.7 — Owner chooses based on risk preference; SC54.2 (Design-Builder bears all investigation/repair costs) applies regardless of funding mechanism |
| **T-004: Escalation Path for Valuation Disputes** | PM arbitrates valuation disputes as independent party per Owner's Advisor role (SC13, Appendix J SC13.2.3.5.1) | Design-Builder and Owner resolve bilaterally | Recommend PM arbitration consistent with SC13.2.3.5.1 (Owner's Advisor interprets and makes findings in first instance); Owner's Advisor not bound by PM's findings but provides neutral starting point |
| **T-005: Post-Occupancy Deadline Enforcement** | Strictly enforce 6-week deadline per RFP — Owner loses right to add deficiencies after week 6 | Allow Owner flexibility beyond 6 weeks at PM discretion | Recommend strict enforcement per RFP 7.3.7 language ("The Owner reserves the right to add...up to six (6) weeks after occupancy"); clear deadline supports Design-Builder's ability to finalize warranty commitment, trigger holdback release, and limit total exposure |

## Examples

**EX-001: Minor Cosmetic Deficiency (Drywall Touch-Up)**
- Identification: Deficiency review finds 2–3 areas of drywall finish below specification (minor dings, seam imperfections).
- SC54 Application: Not a "defect" if caused by normal wear and tear during construction, but IS a deficiency if finish fails to meet contract documents.
- Valuation: ~$200 (drywall finisher: 2 hours labour + materials for compound, primer, paint).
- Resolution: Deferred within warranty; Design-Builder commits to completion within 10 working days of formal request; 20-working-day commencement rule per SC55/GC 12.5.10 applies.
- Holdback Impact: Low — cosmetic item; does not affect Substantial Performance.
- Sign-off: Owner inspects; signs off; item marked Closed on consolidated list.

**EX-002: HVAC System Deficiency (Balancing Non-Conformance)**
- Identification: Comprehensive deficiency inspection plus commissioning agent identifies one zone with insufficient airflow (does not meet design specification from DEL-02-04).
- SC54 Application: Functional deficiency — Design-Builder bears cost of investigation and repair (SC54.2).
- Valuation: ~$2,500 (HVAC technician to rebalance dampers, test, verify airflow; labour + travel + materials).
- Resolution: Functional deficiency — should be resolved before Substantial Performance claim. Design-Builder commits to 5 working days from formal notice.
- Holdback Impact: Medium — functional deficiency; Substantial Performance may be withheld until resolved or holdback applied.
- Sign-off: Commissioning agent re-tests; Owner accepts test report; item marked Closed on consolidated list.

**EX-003: Owner Post-Occupancy Addition (Access Card Reader Calibration)**
- Identification: Week 3 post-occupancy (within 6-week window per RFP 7.3.7, p.23), Owner identifies card readers at one entrance are occasionally unresponsive.
- Process: Owner submits in writing to PM within window. Design-Builder and PM evaluate: item meets deficiency criteria (access control system not performing per contract specification).
- Valuation: ~$500 (access control technician to re-calibrate all affected readers; labour + travel).
- SC55 Application: If access control system requires repeated calibration during warranty period, excessive servicing provision (GC 12.5.9) may apply; warranty restarts from date defect corrected.
- Incorporation: Added to consolidated deficiency list; flagged as Owner post-occupancy addition. Same resolution process applies.
- Resolution: Completed within warranty period; 20-working-day commencement from Owner notice (SC55/GC 12.5.10).
- Sign-off: Owner tests and signs off; item marked Closed.

**EX-004: 12-Month Warranty Review (Roofing Membrane Defect)**
- Identification: At month 11 warranty review, Owner identifies minor membrane lifting at one rooftop penetration (discovered after first winter freeze-thaw cycle).
- SC54 Classification: Warranty obligation — roofing membrane failing to perform for full 12-month warranty duration per SC54.1 (Appendix J, p.71). Not normal wear and tear.
- Design-Builder Obligations: Cost of investigation borne by Design-Builder (SC54.2); repair executed at times convenient for Owner (SC54.3); Owner has right to detailed/exhaustive inspection (SC54.4); if excessive servicing required, warranty restarts per SC55/GC 12.5.9.
- Timeline: Design-Builder commences repairs within 20 working days of Owner's written notice (SC55/GC 12.5.10); completes before warranty expiry.
- Process: Roofing contractor mobilizes; repair executed; PM conducts re-inspection; Owner signs off before warranty expiry.
- Outstanding Issues List: If unable to fully resolve before month 12, item documented on the outstanding warranty issues list per RFP 7.3.7, p.23.

## Conflict Table

**For human ruling (if any contradictions between sources):**

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-DEF-01 | The RFP 7.3.7 deficiency process uses the term "OSR" as a satisfaction standard. OSR in the contract hierarchy per SC6 is "Owner's Statement of Requirements" — a document. The RFP text reads "to the satisfaction of the Owner and the OSR" — it is unclear whether "OSR" here means the Owner's Statement of Requirements document (i.e., requirements must be met per that document) or a separate person/role. | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 ("to the satisfaction of the Owner and the OSR") | Appendix J SC6 (document priority hierarchy, p.62); SC5 does not define "OSR" as a role | Specification R-10; Guidance P-005; Procedure Step 2 Section I | PROPOSAL: "OSR" in this context most likely means the Owner's Statement of Requirements document — deficiency resolution must meet the original functional requirements of that document, not merely a physical repair standard. This is consistent with SC6 which includes the OSR in the document priority order. Confirm with Owner. | TBD — confirm with Owner at pre-submission meeting |
| CONF-DEF-02 | SC1 establishes 10% retention on all progress claims (Appendix J SC1, p.61). The deficiency holdback right in RFP 7.3.7 allows Owner to retain "up to 2.5 times the value of the calculated deficiency cost." It is unclear whether the 10% progress retention and the 2.5x deficiency holdback are additive (stacked) financial withholdings or whether the deficiency holdback is applied from within or against the retained 10%. | RFP 7.3.7, p.23 (2.5x deficiency holdback) | Appendix J SC1 (10% retention), SC3 (2% statutory holdback modified) | Specification R-05, R-09; Guidance P-003, C-005; Datasheet Attributes | PROPOSAL: The 10% progress claim retention and 2.5x deficiency holdback appear to be separate mechanisms serving different purposes (cash flow security vs. deficiency cost coverage). However, the total financial withheld from the Design-Builder at Substantial Performance may combine multiple withholdings. Recommend Legal review of CCDC 14-2013 provisions + SC1 + SC3 interaction before finalizing narrative language on financial protections. | TBD — Legal review required |
