# Guidance — DEL-05-01: Architectural Durability and Maintenance

---

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to **demonstrate that the proposed architectural design will achieve the required 50-year (main building) and 20-year (Cold Storage) design lives through credible, operations-aware material selection, detailing strategy, and maintenance planning**.

**Why it matters:**
- OBJ-005 (Building Durability / Ease of Repair and Maintenance) is worth **15 points out of 100** — the second-highest-weighted technical criterion, equal to Project Team and Firms. (Source: RFP §8.2 Evaluation Criteria, p. 26.)
- The Owner explicitly wants to "keep operations and maintenance costs low with an efficient, cost-effective design solution" (RFP §7.1.1, p. 16).
- The Owner's Statement of Requirements specifically calls out: "The design should consider low maintenance building materials with a minimum 50 year life expectancy for the main building and a 20 year life expectancy for the sand/salt and cold storage." (OSR §10.2, p. 36.)
- Fire and public works facilities operate in high-wear environments (mud, road salt on apparatus wheels, chemical exposure, freeze-thaw cycling). Generic office building durability assumptions will not satisfy the evaluation committee.
- The Owner (Town of Penhold Operations Division) is a municipal entity with limited specialist maintenance capacity; the durability strategy must be realistic for their staffing and budget reality.

**Scoring intent (from Decomposition §Objectives):**
"Materials/systems strategy is credible, operations-aware; 50-year main building / 20-year ancillary lifespan" (Decomposition OBJ-005 — ASSUMPTION: best-effort mapping from package-level objective association).

**Evaluation scoring scale (RFP §8.3, p. 27):**
- Exceptional (100%): exceeds expectations, clear understanding, adds innovation
- Excellent (90%): exceeds expectations, certainty of success
- Very Good (80%): meets expectations, high confidence
- Good (70%): meets most expectations, moderate confidence
- Fair (60%): meets basic expectations, some risk
- Acceptable (50%): barely meets expectations, moderate risk
- Unacceptable (0–40%): missing or below expectations, serious risk

To score at Very Good (80%) or above, the narrative must go beyond generic statements and provide specific, credible durability strategies tied to this building's actual operations. With 15 points available, even moving from "Fair" (60%) to "Very Good" (80%) is worth 3 additional points on the 100-point scale — potentially decisive in a competitive evaluation.

## Principles

### P-001: Operations-First Material Selection

**Principle:** Durability decisions must be grounded in how this specific facility will actually be used, not in generic best practices.

**Application:**
- The main building houses **4 large fire apparatus + 4 small fire apparatus** (future 5 small) in apparatus bays, plus a full range of public works equipment: pickup trucks, tractors, graders, loaders, tandem dump units, street sweepers, bobcats, and other construction-type equipment (per OSR §10.3.5, p. 40). This is not a light-use facility.
- Apparatus bays will experience daily exposure to mud, road salt (on fire apparatus wheels), ice melt chemicals, and occasional washing. Interior finishes must prioritize washability and chemical resistance.
- Public works bays house the full range of municipal equipment noted above; flooring must withstand heavy axle loads and hard tire impact from equipment ranging from compact bobcats to tandem dump trucks.
- Cold Storage is intentionally unheated (equipment storage, not conditioned space); every material in that building must be rated for freeze-thaw cycling without interior heat buffering.
- Bunker gear is contaminated with sweat, soot, and moisture; the storage room must dry gear between uses. Room ventilation is an architectural durability decision, not just a comfort decision.

**Supporting evidence:** RFP §7.1.4 p. 17; OSR §10.3.5 p. 40; Addendum 03 §1.3 (flooring resilience), §1.8 (sumps), §1.13–§1.14 (bunker gear ventilation).

---

### P-002: Design Life Alignment — 50 Years vs. 20 Years

**Principle:** Material selection must match the required design life. The main building and Cold Storage require different durability investment levels.

**Application:**
- **Main building (50 years):** Select cladding, roofing, and interior finishes with demonstrated 50-year longevity or documented replacement intervals within the window. Use lifecycle planning to show total cost of ownership.
- **Cold Storage (20 years):** Accept shorter design life; apply economical durability strategy. OSR §10.3.6 (p. 40) specifically states "The cold storage building has no foundation preference assuming that the most-cost effective solution would be pursued (i.e. post and frame construction (pole shed))." Metal cladding on post-frame is the cost-effective Cold Storage approach.
- Do not over-specify Cold Storage with 50-year materials; document the intentional differentiation to show the evaluation committee that the Design-Builder understands value engineering.

**Supporting evidence:** RFP OSR §10.2 p. 36; OSR §10.3.6 p. 40.

---

### P-003: Maintenance Must Be Realistic for Municipal Operations

**Principle:** Do not specify systems that require specialized craftspeople or resources the Town of Penhold Operations Division will not have.

**Application:**
- Choose finishes that can be cleaned by standard janitorial/maintenance staff with commonly available tools and chemicals.
- Specify standardized, readily available hardware and replacement parts — not custom or proprietary components.
- Plan maintenance intervals that can be budgeted for and executed by a small municipal operations team.
- For apparatus bay flooring (sealed concrete), the maintenance cycle should be: periodic power wash, periodic re-sealing — tasks achievable in-house.
- Avoid "lifetime warranty" claims unless backed by manufacturer data; the Owner will see through generic assurances.
- OSR §10.3.4 (p. 39) requires that design be "easy to maintain" — this is an explicit evaluation criterion, not an aspiration.

**Supporting evidence:** RFP §7.1.1 p. 16 (Owner desire to keep operations costs low); RFP §7.6 (warranty requirements tied to O&M manuals); OSR §10.3.4 p. 39.

---

### P-004: Whole-Building Durability Thinking

**Principle:** Durability is a systems-level strategy integrating structure, envelope, interior systems, and maintenance access — not an individual material decision.

**Application:**
- Coordinate with DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability): the interface between cladding/air barrier and structural steel is shared responsibility. Moisture that penetrates the envelope to reach structural steel or embedded anchor bolts initiates corrosion that reduces building life.
- Coordinate with DEL-05-03 (Mechanical Maintainability): apparatus bay exhaust ventilation systems need duct access panels that are architecturally accommodated; filter-change frequency affects interior finish strategy.
- Plan for bay sump design: sump construction in the apparatus bay slab is both a structural detail (DEL-05-02) and an architectural floor design decision (drainage slopes, sealant at sump edges).
- OSR §11.2 (p. 44) explicitly addresses the envelope/moisture management interface: "Ensure positive drainage of condensation within wall construction and water entering at joints, directing it to the exterior face of the wall."

**Supporting evidence:** OSR §11.2 p. 44; Decomposition PKG-005 §Goal: "broken out by discipline responsibility"; DEL-05-01 §References.

---

### P-005: Freeze-Thaw and Salt Exposure (Penhold Climate + Operations-Specific)

**Principle:** Penhold, Alberta experiences significant freeze-thaw cycling and road salt is present on both the exterior site and inside apparatus bays (carried by fire apparatus). Material selection must account for both ambient climate and operational chemical exposure.

**Application:**
- Concrete (slabs, aprons): specify air-entrained concrete for freeze-thaw protection; plan for periodic sealant reapplication at apparatus bay slabs and exterior concrete aprons.
- Exterior cladding: choose materials with proven freeze-thaw durability and low water absorption coefficient; avoid materials that absorb moisture and fail during freeze cycles.
- Steel fasteners and hardware (particularly in apparatus bay and Cold Storage environments): specify hot-dip galvanized or stainless steel; "car wash" grade hardware is specified for main building overhead doors (per OSR §10.3.9, p. 42) specifically to "withstand impacts of salt and condensation."
- Apparatus bay slab: sealed concrete (per Addendum 03 §1.3) resists salt infiltration; plan for periodic re-sealing as part of maintenance cycle.
- Cold Storage slab/floor: compacted asphalt millings (Option 1) or concrete (Option 2) — both must handle freeze-thaw without heated building to prevent cycling.
- Site asphalt: OSR §10.3.7 (p. 40–41) calls for heavy duty asphalt for the direct routing of fire apparatus to Waskasoo Avenue — this is also a durability consideration for the building aprons and immediate site.

**Supporting evidence:** RFP OSR §10.3.5 p. 40; Addendum 03 §1.3 p. 2; OSR §10.3.9 p. 42 ("car wash grade hardware"); OSR §10.3.7 p. 40–41.

---

### P-006: Non-Combustibility Constrains Durability Material Selection

**Principle:** The OSR §11.3 requirement for "non-combustible" materials is an authoritative quality benchmark that constrains the range of acceptable durability solutions. Material selection for both cladding and interior finishes must satisfy non-combustibility before other durability criteria are considered. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing E-002; the non-combustibility constraint interacts with durability choices but was not previously integrated into guidance reasoning.)*

**Application:**
- OSR §11.3 (p. 44) requires "watertight, non-combustible construction." This is a hard constraint, not a preference.
- Certain high-durability cladding options (e.g., fiber-cement composites, certain polymer-based panels) may offer excellent freeze-thaw and impact performance but must first be verified as non-combustible per NBCC combustibility testing classification.
- Interior finishes in apparatus bays and PW bays must also meet non-combustibility requirements given the occupancy type (fire apparatus storage, occasional welding in PW bays).
- The Architect must document how the non-combustibility requirement was satisfied for each proposed material in the durability narrative, confirming that fire-resistance classification does not conflict with the preferred durability solution.
- Where a preferred durability material is combustible, the narrative should identify the non-combustible alternative selected and explain any durability trade-off accepted.
- **ASSUMPTION:** NBCC combustibility testing (CAN/ULC-S114 or equivalent) is the applicable standard for determining non-combustibility; confirm with AHJ.

**Supporting evidence:** RFP OSR §11.3 p. 44; Specification R-002 (non-combustible cladding requirement).

---

### P-007: Solar-Ready Roofing is a Design Constraint, Not Just a Feature

**Principle:** The requirement for solar-capable roofing (Addendum 03 §1.17) drives roof orientation, structural provisions, and the durability approach for the roof as a long-term energy platform.

**Application:**
- Roof orientation must be flat, south, west, or southwest sloped (per Addendum 03 §1.17, p. 4: "Solar capable roofing is required. Roof orientation can be flat, south, west, or southwest sloped to accommodate solar panels in the future.").
- This is not optional; it is a confirmed Owner requirement.
- Solar-ready provisions mean the roof membrane/material selection must accommodate future penetrations (conduit rough-ins) without compromising weather-tightness.
- Roofing system should have a service life compatible with future solar installation; plan so that roof replacement cycle does not disrupt a future solar installation.
- OSR §11.3 (p. 44) requires "heavy duty membrane cover" — this is consistent with a long-life roofing system.

**Supporting evidence:** Addendum 03 §1.17 p. 4; OSR §11.3 p. 44.

## Considerations

### C-001: Material Cost vs. Lifecycle Cost

**Trade-off:** Higher initial material cost vs. lower long-term maintenance and replacement burden.

**Guidance:**
- For the main building (50-year design life), a slightly higher-cost roofing membrane or cladding with longer service life may be superior total cost of ownership compared to budget materials requiring frequent replacement.
- Quantify lifecycle cost assumptions: material replacement intervals, maintenance labor frequency, cleaning chemical costs.
- Example: A TPO or EPDM roofing membrane at 25-year expected service life, replaced once at year 25, is often more economical over 50 years than a lower-cost membrane replaced at years 10, 20, 30, and 40.
- For Cold Storage (20-year design life), economical choices are appropriate and should be documented as intentional.

**ASSUMPTION:** Owner priorities lean toward reliability and ease of maintenance over lowest initial cost (typical for public facilities managing long-term operating budgets).

---

### C-002: Apparatus Bay Flooring — Concrete Sealing and Maintenance Cycle

**Trade-off:** Epoxy coating (higher initial cost, high durability, requires periodic recoating) vs. basic sealed concrete (lower initial cost, adequate durability, simpler maintenance).

**Guidance:**
- Addendum 03 §1.3 specifies "resilient material that can be easily cleaned of mud and dust such as sealed concrete." This confirms sealed concrete as the baseline.
- Epoxy coating is an upgrade that improves chemical resistance and cleanability; justified in fire apparatus bays given salt/chemical exposure from fire apparatus operations.
- Power-wash-compatible sealing is critical; choose sealers designed for commercial/industrial washdown environments.
- Plan for 3-5 year resealing cycles for basic sealed concrete in apparatus bays (ASSUMPTION; specific interval TBD based on product selection and usage intensity).
- **Important: maintenance intervals differ by finish type.** Basic sealed concrete requires resealing every 3-5 years (ASSUMPTION). Epoxy-coated concrete requires recoating every 7-10 years (ASSUMPTION; see T-002). These are distinct maintenance strategies with different intervals and should not be conflated. When documenting maintenance intervals in the narrative, clearly differentiate between the sealed concrete cycle and the epoxy recoating cycle. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing C-001; the Procedure maintenance table previously merged both ranges into "3-10 years," which conflates two different strategies.)*
- Sump drainage integration at slab level must not compromise sealer continuity at sump edges.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.3 p. 2.

---

### C-003: 16 ft Overhead Doors — High-Use, High-Stress Components

**Trade-off:** Standard commercial overhead door (lower cost, adequate for occasional use) vs. heavy-duty commercial system (higher cost, designed for high-frequency fire apparatus operation).

**Guidance:**
- Apparatus bay doors will be operated multiple times daily (fire response, equipment maintenance, training); this is not a light-use application.
- "Car wash" grade hardware specified for main building per OSR §10.3.9 p. 42 — this reflects the salt and condensation environment inside the apparatus bay. The OSR language confirms this is specifically intended "to withstand impacts of salt and condensation."
- Plan preventive maintenance: spring tension checks, roller lubrication, weather seal inspection and replacement (ASSUMPTION: every 5–7 years typical; confirm with manufacturer).
- Verify that replacement springs, panels, and hardware are standardized (not custom) and available through regional suppliers.
- Secondary opening mechanism (Addendum 03 §1.15, p. 4): "bay doors require secondary opening mechanisms (either by backup generation power or manually opening)" — architectural design must accommodate this without compromising door weather sealing.
- Door clearance: roof/door structural height must accommodate type 1 fire engines and type 1 ladders as well as PW equipment (graders, tandem dump trucks, loaders) per OSR §10.3.9.

**Source:** RFP OSR §10.3.9 p. 41–42; Addendum 03 §1.10 p. 3; §1.15 p. 4.

---

### C-004: Cold Storage — Accept vs. Mitigate Freeze-Thaw

**Trade-off:** Heated enclosure (expensive, reduces storage utility, not the Owner's intent) vs. fully freeze-thaw-designed unheated building.

**Guidance:**
- Cold Storage is intentionally unheated per OSR §10.2 p. 36 (unheated equipment storage). The design must accept and mitigate freeze-thaw — not eliminate it.
- Adequate ventilation or alternate air circulation is required to prevent condensation and icing (per OSR §11.1.2, p. 43).
- All plumbing (if any) in Cold Storage must either be heated (from conditioned space) or winterized (drained when not in use); no trapped water.
- Interior: minimize finish complexity; focus on structural protection. Concrete slab (Option 2) or compacted asphalt millings (Option 1) per OSR §10.3.8.
- Cladding should be metal roofing or equivalent with low water absorption; avoid claddings that retain moisture and fail in freeze cycles.
- Post-frame construction is explicitly identified by the Owner as appropriate for Cold Storage (OSR §10.3.6, p. 40).

**Source:** RFP OSR §10.2 p. 36; OSR §10.3.6 p. 40; OSR §10.3.8 p. 41; OSR §11.1.2 p. 43.

---

### C-005: Moisture Management — No Storm Sewer On-Site

**Consideration:** There is no storm sewer on-site (per OSR §11.2, p. 44). All drainage from roof structures must be directed to appropriate natural drainage off-site.

**Guidance:**
- OSR §11.2 (p. 44) explicitly states: "Since there is no storm sewer on-site, ensure efficient drainage of freshwater flow from the roof structures away to appropriate natural drainage off site."
- Roof drainage design must direct runoff to natural drainage grades; cannot rely on storm sewer connection.
- Apparatus bay sumps (Addendum 03 §1.8) collect snow melt and minor washing water internally; confirm sump discharge strategy (holding tank, grease trap, municipal connection, or other) — discharge strategy is a joint architectural/mechanical/civil decision (ASSUMPTION: municipal discharge if available at site; confirm with civil).
- Positive drainage away from all building perimeters is required (per OSR §10.3.2 p. 39).

**Source:** RFP OSR §11.2 p. 44; OSR §10.3.2 p. 39; Addendum 03 §1.8 p. 3.

---

### C-006: Coordination with DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability)

**Consideration:** The cladding/structure interface is a shared durability responsibility.

**Guidance:**
- Architect specifies cladding finish and air barrier strategy (DEL-05-01).
- Structural Engineer specifies substrate protection and embedded connection corrosion protection (DEL-05-02).
- Critical interfaces to coordinate: flashing and drainage plane at cladding/structure connection; corrosion protection for anchor bolts and embedded steel in apparatus bay environment; sump construction details at slab-on-grade.
- Water fill stations are at ground level (per Addendum 03 §1.16); slab penetration design should be coordinated between architect (floor finish continuity at penetration) and structural engineer (slab opening reinforcement).
- Risk of conflict: if architect assumes structural protection at a detail and structural engineer does not include it, the building may have unprotected vulnerability.

**Recommended action:** Joint review of envelope details and slab penetration strategy between Architect and Structural Engineer during design development.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Roofing — Long-Life Membrane vs. Economy Membrane

**Scenario:**
- **Option A (Long-life):** TPO or EPDM single-ply membrane, 25-year expected service life, excellent UV and weather resistance, solar-ready flat roof orientation; higher initial cost; "heavy duty membrane cover" per OSR §11.3.
- **Option B (Economy):** Modified bitumen or SBS membrane, 15-year expected service life, adequate weather resistance; lower initial cost.

**Analysis:** For a 50-year building, Option B requires 3–4 replacements vs. 1 replacement for Option A. Total lifecycle cost of Option B over 50 years is typically higher than Option A including 1 replacement.

**Recommendation:** Option A is preferred for the main building. Document the replacement plan (year 25) and include solar-ready electrical rough-ins during initial installation to avoid future roof penetration disruption.

**Lifecycle Cost Comparison Framework** *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing F-002; providing a template with placeholder values makes the merit judgment defensible and gives the estimator a structure to populate.)*

| Cost Component | Option A (Long-Life, 25-yr) | Option B (Economy, 15-yr) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial installation cost | $ TBD | $ TBD | Estimator to populate |
| Number of replacements over 50 years | 1 (at year ~25) | 3 (at years ~15, ~30, ~45) | Based on expected service life |
| Cost per replacement (present value) | $ TBD | $ TBD | Include tear-off, disposal, re-roofing |
| Annual maintenance cost | $ TBD | $ TBD | Inspection, minor repairs, drain clearing |
| Total 50-year lifecycle cost (NPV) | $ TBD | $ TBD | Discount rate TBD (ASSUMPTION: 3-4% typical for public facility lifecycle analysis) |
| Solar disruption risk | Low (1 replacement) | High (3 replacements may disrupt future solar installation) | Qualitative consideration |

*The estimator should populate this framework with project-specific values. Even with placeholder values, the structural argument (1 replacement vs. 3-4 replacements) supports the Option A recommendation.*

**ASSUMPTION:** Lifecycle cost difference favors Option A; specific pricing TBD from cost estimator.

---

### T-002: Apparatus Bay Flooring — Basic Sealed vs. Epoxy-Coated Concrete

**Scenario:**
- **Option A (Basic):** Sealed concrete (per Addendum 03 §1.3); adequate chemical and moisture resistance; lower cost; maintenance by re-sealing every 3–5 years (ASSUMPTION).
- **Option B (Upgrade):** Epoxy broadcast or self-leveling topcoat on concrete; improved chemical and slip resistance; easier to power wash; higher initial cost; recoating every 7–10 years (ASSUMPTION).

**Analysis:** Apparatus bay environment (salt from fire apparatus, chemicals, power washing) benefits from epoxy's superior chemical resistance and cleanability. The specification (Addendum 03 §1.3) confirms "resilient material that can be easily cleaned" as the baseline — epoxy exceeds this baseline.

**Recommendation:** Option B (epoxy-coated) for fire apparatus bays where budget permits; Option A (sealed concrete) as minimum acceptable. Confirm with cost estimator. PW bays may be Option A given less frequent chemical exposure.

---

### T-003: Cold Storage Flooring — Asphalt Millings vs. Concrete

**Scenario:** OSR §10.3.8 provides two options:
- **Option 1:** Compacted asphalt millings + 4 ft wide concrete strips at pallet racking. Lower cost; appropriate for equipment storage; smooth and safe operation.
- **Option 2:** Full concrete floor + concrete aprons at doors. Higher cost; smoother and more durable for wide range of equipment use.

**Analysis:** Cold Storage has a 20-year design life; economical Option 1 is aligned with that target and is the Owner's stated preference. Option 2 provides pricing alternative. The OSR explicitly requests pricing for both options from the Design-Builder.

**Recommendation:** Present both options with pricing per OSR §10.3.8 instruction. Architect should recommend Option 1 for base proposal with Option 2 as alternate pricing. Both options require concrete aprons at overhead and person door access points.

## Examples

### EX-001: Acceptable Apparatus Bay Flooring Strategy

**Material:** Sealed or epoxy-coated concrete slab-on-grade.
- Resilient material easily cleaned of mud and dust (per Addendum 03 §1.3).
- Sump drain integrated at slab level for snow melt and minor washing (per Addendum 03 §1.8).
- Slab edge sealant at sump to prevent salt infiltration under slab.
- Re-sealing or recoating cycle documented in maintenance plan.
- Power wash compatible.

**Why this works:** Directly responds to Owner's confirmed requirements; achievable by in-house maintenance staff; standardized materials available regionally; addresses the specific operational environment (fire apparatus with mud, road salt, and ice melt chemicals).

---

### EX-002: Problematic — Generic Durability Claims Without Specifics

**What NOT to do:**
> "We will use high-quality, durable materials throughout the facility to ensure a long service life."

**Why this fails:**
- No specific materials named.
- No lifecycle data or maintenance intervals.
- No recognition of apparatus bay environment (salt, chemical, power washing) or Cold Storage freeze-thaw context.
- Evaluation committee scoring (per RFP §8.3): this response would score at "Fair" (60%) or below — meeting only basic expectations with no demonstrated understanding.

**What to do instead:**
> "Apparatus bay floors will be sealed concrete (minimum, per Addendum 03 §1.3) with epoxy broadcast topcoat in high-wear zones, providing chemical resistance to road salt and de-icing agents carried in on apparatus wheels. Maintenance involves annual inspection and power washing, with recoating every 7–10 years using standard industrial epoxy products available from regional suppliers. Bay sumps (required per Addendum 03 §1.8) are integrated at slab level with sloped drainage toward sump edges, sealed to prevent salt infiltration."

This response is specific, operationally-aware, and credible.

---

### EX-003: Bunker Gear Room — Effective Ventilation and Moisture Strategy

**Strategy:**
- Room-level mechanical exhaust ventilation (not per-locker) per Addendum 03 §1.14: "Direct ventilation to each locker is not required, however, the room itself should have ventilation."
- Non-absorbent floor finish (sealed concrete slab; no carpet).
- Wall finishes: semi-gloss or epoxy paint (moisture-resistant, wipeable).
- Locker row layout allowing air circulation behind and between lockers.
- Room sized to 200–350 ft² (Fire Gear Storage per Addendum 03 §1.21) to accommodate 40 lockers with firefighter access clearance.
- Coordinate with DEL-05-03 (Mechanical) to confirm ventilation rate is adequate for 40 lockers with contaminated gear drying cycles.

**Why this works:** Directly addresses Addendum 03 §1.14 requirement; prevents mold growth on gear and room surfaces; achievable with standard HVAC ventilation; room sizing is consistent with Addendum 03 §1.21 guidance.

---

### EX-004: Cold Storage — Freeze-Thaw Appropriate Cladding and Structure

**Material:** Galvanized steel or aluminum metal cladding (standing seam or ribbed panel) on post-frame structure.
- Low water absorption coefficient — no moisture retention at freeze-thaw cycles.
- Proven durability in unheated agricultural and storage building applications in Alberta.
- 20-year design life achievable with minimal maintenance (inspect seams, clear debris from gutters, check fastener integrity).
- Compatible with the Cold Storage scale (60 ft x 100 ft, clear span) and cost-effective construction approach explicitly identified in OSR §10.3.6: "post and frame construction (pole shed)" is the Owner's preferred cost-effective approach.
- Consistent with OSR §11.3 requirement for "durable, flexible materials" on a 20-year design life budget.

**Why this works:** Matched to 20-year design life; appropriate to unheated environment; economical; regionally available; backed by direct OSR §10.3.6 language.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None identified | — | — | — | — | — | TBD |

*No conflicts identified during Pass 1 and Pass 2 review. Cold Storage flooring Options 1 and 2 are both valid per OSR §10.3.8; they are alternatives, not contradictions. If a contradiction between material selections in DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept) and this narrative emerges during detailed design, it should be added here.*

*Note: OSR §11.3 mentions "stainless steel base plates for corrosion resistance" specifically in the context of the pickled-sand storage building (now excluded per Addendum 03 §1.2). This does not create a conflict — the corrosion resistance principle applies broadly to apparatus bay hardware in the main building, but the specific material prescription (stainless steel base plates) is not required outside the pickled-sand context.*
