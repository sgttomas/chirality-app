## Scope

This specification establishes the requirements for producing the Architectural Durability and Maintenance narrative.

**RFP §7.1.4 requirement (verbatim, p. 17):** "Describe the approach to building durability (both exterior and interior), including design approach, selection of various systems, components, materials, and construction methods used. Also describe the ease of repair and maintenance of the building and all systems and components."

**OSR §10.3.4 design standard (verbatim, p. 39):** "Project design of all systems and assemblies must be practical, energy efficient, cost effective, and easy to maintain."

### Scope Inclusions

2. **Roofing System Strategy** — material selection, expected service life and replacement intervals, solar-ready provisions (per Addendum 03 §1.17), roof drainage, inspection and maintenance schedule.
3. **Interior Finishes Strategy** — operations-environment focus: apparatus bays (mud, salt, chemical exposure), public works bays (vehicle fluids, oil, salt), residential quarters (multi-shift occupancy, decontamination area), offices and shared spaces; washability and chemical resistance criteria.
4. **Flooring Systems by Zone** — apparatus/equipment bays, offices, residential quarters, Cold Storage building; sump drainage integration (Addendum 03 §1.8).
5. **Door and Hardware Durability** — 16 ft overhead doors (Addendum 03 §1.10), hardware grade by building type, person doors, secondary bay door opening mechanism.

- **Mechanical Engineer (DEL-05-03):** Equipment access, filter change frequency, HVAC durability, plumbing maintainability (water fill stations at ground level, sumps, sump discharge strategy).
- **Electrical Engineer (DEL-05-04):** Panel accessibility, lighting fixture replacement strategy (fixture heights adjusted to avoid machinery interference per OSR §10.5), generator provisions for bay door secondary opening.

**Artifacts:** Cross-reference notes; joint review checklist.

---

## Notes

- Specific products and manufacturers will be confirmed during detailed design; this specification establishes the performance and lifecycle criteria for selection.
- O&M manuals (required per RFP §7.5) will provide detailed maintenance schedules; this narrative establishes the strategic rationale.
- Owner expects design to "keep operations and maintenance costs low with an efficient, cost-effective design solution" (RFP §7.1.1, p. 16).
- OSR §11.3 (p. 44) references stainless steel base plates for corrosion resistance specifically in the context of the pickled-sand storage building (now excluded per Addendum 03 §1.2); however, the corrosion resistance principle is applicable to apparatus bay hardware in the main building given the operational chemical environment.
