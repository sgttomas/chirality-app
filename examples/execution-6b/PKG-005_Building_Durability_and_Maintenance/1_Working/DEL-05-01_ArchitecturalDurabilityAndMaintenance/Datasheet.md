## Construction

### Scope Statement

This deliverable documents the **architectural durability and maintenance strategy** spanning six topic areas:

1. Exterior cladding selection rationale (weather resistance, impact resistance, maintenance frequency)
2. Roofing system selection and lifecycle (including solar-ready provisions)
3. Interior finishes strategy for operations environment (mud, dust, salt, equipment wear, chemical exposure)
4. Flooring systems by zone (apparatus bays, offices, residential quarters, Cold Storage)
5. Door and hardware durability (including 16 ft overhead doors and bay secondary opening)
6. Moisture management at transitions, penetrations, and bay drainage (sumps)
