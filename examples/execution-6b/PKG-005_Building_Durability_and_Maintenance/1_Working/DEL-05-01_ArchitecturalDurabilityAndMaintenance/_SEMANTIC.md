# Deliverable: DEL-05-01 Architectural Durability and Maintenance

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to establish the architectural durability and maintenance knowledge framework for a multi-use public services building, ensuring that material selections, construction detailing, and maintenance strategies credibly demonstrate long-term serviceability under high-wear operational conditions across differentiated design life targets. It must carry the knowledge necessary to prove that envelope, finish, and component choices will endure fire apparatus chemical exposure, public works equipment wear, and severe freeze-thaw cycling over a fifty-year main building and twenty-year cold storage horizon.
