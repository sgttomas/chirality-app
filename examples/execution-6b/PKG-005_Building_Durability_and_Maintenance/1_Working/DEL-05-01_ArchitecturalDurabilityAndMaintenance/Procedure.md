---

## Steps

### Step A1: Confirm Scope and Special Requirements

**Action:**
1. Read RFP §7.1.4 (p. 17) to internalize the verbatim requirement: "Describe the approach to building durability (both exterior and interior), including design approach, selection of various systems, components, materials, and construction methods used. Also describe the ease of repair and maintenance of the building and all systems and components."
2. Read OSR §10.2 (p. 36): note exact design life language — "minimum 50 year life expectancy for the main building and a 20 year life expectancy for the sand/salt and cold storage" — and "low maintenance building materials."
3. Read OSR §10.3.4 (p. 39): note "practical, energy efficient, cost effective, and easy to maintain" as the design standard.
4. Read Addendum 03 and extract all items with architectural durability implications (§1.3, §1.8, §1.10, §1.13–§1.14, §1.15, §1.16, §1.17, §1.21).
5. Confirm the two design lives: 50-year main building, 20-year Cold Storage.
6. Confirm pickled-sand storage building is excluded from scope (Addendum 03 §1.2).
7. Create a tracking checklist mapping each RFP/Addendum 03 requirement to the corresponding narrative section.

**Output:** Scope confirmation checklist; Addendum 03 requirements map.

| Addendum 03 Item | Narrative Section | Addressed? |
|---|---|---|
| §1.3 — Flooring: resilient, easily cleaned (sealed concrete) | Flooring systems | TBD |
| §1.8 — Bay sumps required (all bays) | Moisture management / flooring | TBD |
| §1.10 — 16 ft overhead door height (main building) | Door and hardware durability | TBD |
| §1.13 — 40 bunker gear lockers | Interior finishes / bunker gear room | TBD |
| §1.14 — Bunker gear room ventilation (room level) | Interior finishes / bunker gear room | TBD |
| §1.15 — Secondary bay door opening (generator power or manual) | Door and hardware durability | TBD |
| §1.16 — Water fill stations (2" min, two locations, at ground level) | Moisture management / corrosion | TBD |
| §1.17 — Solar-capable roofing required | Roofing system | TBD |
| §1.21 — Room sizes (bunker gear room: Fire Gear Storage 200–350 ft²) | Interior finishes | TBD |

---

### Step A2: Gather Architectural Material Selections

**Action:**
1. From Architectural Concept (DEL-02-01), extract preliminary material selections:
   - Proposed exterior cladding (material type, finish, panel system or continuous)
   - Proposed roofing system (membrane type, slope, drainage strategy, orientation; confirm solar-capable orientation)
   - Interior finish materials by zone (apparatus bays, offices, residential, shared)
   - Door and hardware types (overhead door manufacturer/model preference if any)
2. For each selection not yet finalized: mark as **TBD — to be confirmed during detailed design**.
3. Identify performance data needed per material:
   - Freeze-thaw durability test results (ASTM) for exterior cladding
   - Roofing membrane service life data; "heavy duty membrane" consistent with OSR §11.3
   - Concrete sealer chemical resistance data (apparatus bay slabs)
   - Overhead door hardware rating for salt/condensation environments ("car wash" grade per OSR §10.3.9)
   - Cold Storage metal cladding freeze-thaw performance
4. **Validate overhead door spring life assumption:** Request manufacturer data on spring cycle life (number of cycles to failure) for the proposed overhead door model. Calculate expected annual cycles based on fire apparatus bay daily use frequency (multiple operations per day for response, maintenance, training). Confirm whether the 5-10 year replacement assumption (ASSUMPTION from Procedure Step A5) is consistent with manufacturer-specified cycle life. If manufacturer data indicates a different interval, update the maintenance table accordingly. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing E-001; overhead door springs in a fire hall are a critical operational component for emergency response egress.)*

**Output:** Material selection summary (preliminary); TBD list; validated spring life data or confirmed TBD with manufacturer inquiry initiated.

---

### Step A3: Coordinate with Structural Durability (DEL-05-02)

**Action:**
1. Meet with Structural Engineer to align on shared envelope durability responsibilities:
   - Air barrier location and vapor permeability (architect specifies cladding/air barrier; structural specifies substrate protection)
   - Flashing and drainage plane at cladding/structure interface (key vulnerability for 50-year envelope life)
   - Corrosion protection for embedded anchor bolts and steel in apparatus bay environment
   - Slab-on-grade sump design details: sump construction, drainage slope, sealant at sump edge, sump size and location within bay grid
   - Cold Storage slab/floor design (Options 1 and 2)
   - Water fill station slab penetration details: ground-level installation confirmed per Addendum 03 §1.16; coordinate slab opening reinforcement, sleeve, and sealant strategy
2. Document agreed interface responsibilities and any open items.

**Output:** Structural coordination notes; agreed sump design approach; cladding/structure interface approach; fill station slab penetration strategy.

---

### Step A4: Coordinate with Mechanical Maintainability (DEL-05-03)

**Action:**
1. Meet with Mechanical Engineer to understand:
   - Apparatus bay exhaust ventilation maintenance: duct access panels, filter replacement access; any architectural ceiling/soffit design implications
   - Bay sump discharge strategy: where does sump drainage go? (Municipal connection, holding tank, grease trap — confirm civil/mechanical responsibility; note Addendum 03 §1.6 confirms water and wastewater stubbed at site corner)
   - Water fill stations (2" minimum, two locations, at ground level): ground-level installation confirmed per Addendum 03 §1.16; plumbing riser location and connection strategy; corrosion considerations for the fitting and connection point in apparatus bay environment
   - Plumbing lines in Cold Storage (if any): confirm winterization or heated strategy; no trapped water in unheated environment
   - Bunker gear room ventilation: confirm mechanical ventilation rate adequate for 40 lockers with contaminated gear drying cycles
2. Identify any architectural finish or floor implications from mechanical maintenance requirements.

**Output:** Mechanical coordination notes; confirmed sump discharge approach; fill station installation strategy; bunker gear room ventilation rate confirmation.

---

### Step A5: Draft Narrative Document

**Action:**
1. Write the architectural durability and maintenance strategy narrative covering the following sections:

   **Section 1 — Executive Summary (1–2 paragraphs)**
   - Overview of durability strategy
   - Two design lives explicitly stated: "minimum 50 year life expectancy for the main building and a 20 year life expectancy for the cold storage" (OSR §10.2)
   - Key durability drivers: apparatus bay chemical environment, freeze-thaw at all exterior elements and Cold Storage, solar-ready roofing, 16 ft overhead door hardware grade
   - Design standard: "practical, energy efficient, cost effective, and easy to maintain" (OSR §10.3.4)

   **Section 2 — Exterior Cladding**
   - Material selection and rationale
   - Weather resistance (freeze-thaw, wind, UV, rain) — performance data or service life claim
   - Impact resistance relative to apparatus bay / vehicle traffic areas
   - Maintenance frequency (inspection and treatment intervals)
   - Lifecycle replacement interval aligned to 50-year design life
   - Watertight and non-combustible per OSR §11.3

   **Section 3 — Roofing System**
   - Material type and expected service life; "heavy duty membrane cover" per OSR §11.3
   - Solar-capable design per Addendum 03 §1.17: orientation (flat, south, west, or SW sloped); structural provisions for future solar panel loads; electrical rough-in conduit strategy
   - Positive drainage away from structure — no storm sewer on-site; freshwater directed to natural drainage off-site (per OSR §11.2)
   - Weather-tight construction (per OSR §10.3.9); withstands snow, lateral, and wind loads in Penhold
   - Inspection and maintenance schedule (annual inspection minimum; membrane replacement interval documented)

   **Section 4 — Interior Finishes Strategy**
   By zone:
   - *Fire apparatus bays*: Surface must withstand mud, road salt (from 4 large + 4 small fire apparatus), ice melt chemicals, power washing; sealed or epoxy-coated concrete (per Addendum 03 §1.3); washable by standard maintenance staff
   - *Public works bays*: Pickup trucks, graders, tandem dumps, bobcats, loaders; vehicle fluid and salt resistance; same minimum standard as apparatus bays
   - *Offices and shared spaces*: Commercial-grade; sealed concrete or resilient flooring per Addendum 03 §1.3; easy to clean
   - *Residential quarters and PW locker room*: Balance durability with occupant comfort; moisture-resistant in bathroom/shower zones; semi-gloss or satin paint finish (cleanable)
   - *Decontamination area (150–200 ft²) + Decontamination Shower/WR (50–60 ft² x 2)*: Full moisture resistance; chemical resistance; drainage; cleanable surfaces
   - *Bunker gear room (Fire Gear Storage: 200–350 ft²)*: Non-absorbent floor (sealed concrete slab; no carpet); moisture-resistant wall finish; room ventilation per Addendum 03 §1.14; sized for 40 lockers with firefighter access clearance per Addendum 03 §1.21

   **Section 5 — Flooring Systems by Zone**
   - Main building bays: Concrete slab (sealed or epoxy-coated) including concrete aprons for both departments per OSR §10.3.8; sump integration per Addendum 03 §1.8 (drainage slopes toward sumps; edge sealant)
   - Main building offices/shared: Most cost-effective resilient material such as sealed concrete; easily cleaned (Addendum 03 §1.3)
   - Cold Storage Option 1: Compacted asphalt millings + 4 ft wide concrete strips at pallet racking (OSR §10.3.8) — lower cost; aligned to 20-year design life
   - Cold Storage Option 2: Concrete floor + aprons at overhead and person doors (OSR §10.3.8) — provide alternate pricing
   - Concrete aprons: All overhead door access points; designed to support weight of service vehicles including Type 1 fire engines, graders, tandem dump trucks (OSR §10.3.10)

   **Section 6 — Door and Hardware Durability**
   - Main building overhead doors: 16 ft x 16 ft minimum (Addendum 03 §1.10); motorized with remote control; "car wash" grade hardware (OSR §10.3.9, p. 42: "to withstand impacts of salt and condensation") for salt/condensation resistance; window profile per door orientation (poly vs metal); clearance for Type 1 fire apparatus and ladders, graders, tandem dump trucks
   - Cold Storage overhead doors: 16 ft x 16 ft; two doors on opposite sides (OSR §10.3.9); motorized; standard grade hardware
   - Person doors: Cold Storage — two person doors with keyed deadbolt (same key as Cold Storage overhead; OSR §10.3.9 p. 42)
   - Secondary opening mechanism: Bay doors — secondary opening by backup generation power or manual (Addendum 03 §1.15, p. 4); architectural design must accommodate without compromising weather sealing
   - Hardware standardization: Confirm all overhead door springs, panels, and hardware are standard items available from regional suppliers

   **Section 7 — Moisture Management**
   - Air barrier: Design and continuity strategy (architect specifies; structural specifies substrate — see Step A3)
   - Transitions: Cladding/roof, roof/wall, foundation/wall — flashing strategy; drainage plane
   - Penetrations: Mechanical, electrical, plumbing — sealant approach; weatherproofing; ground-level fill station slab penetrations (sealed per coordination with DEL-05-02)
   - Bay sumps: All bays (Addendum 03 §1.8) — drainage slope toward sumps; sealant at sump edge to prevent salt infiltration under slab; sump discharge strategy (TBD — mechanical/civil; note services stubbed at site corner per Addendum 03 §1.6)
   - Cold Storage condensation: Adequate ventilation/alternate air circulation to prevent condensation and icing (per OSR §11.1.2); no heated envelope; no trapped water in plumbing (if any)
   - Drainage (no storm sewer on-site): All roof runoff directed to natural drainage off-site (per OSR §11.2: "ensure efficient drainage of freshwater flow from the roof structures away to appropriate natural drainage off site")

   **Section 8 — Cold Storage Building Specific Durability**
   - 20-year design life (economical but credible): differentiated from main building
   - Unheated; all materials rated for freeze-thaw cycling without interior heat buffering
   - Post-frame (pole shed) or equivalent cost-effective structural approach explicitly supported by OSR §10.3.6
   - Cladding: Metal (galvanized steel or aluminum standing seam) or equivalent low water-absorption material
   - Flooring: Options 1 (asphalt millings) and 2 (concrete) per OSR §10.3.8 — present pricing for both
   - Ventilation: Adequate air circulation to prevent condensation and icing (per OSR §11.1.2)
   - Openings: Two 16 ft x 16 ft overhead doors (opposite sides) + two person doors with keyed deadbolt (per OSR §10.3.9)

   **Section 9 — Maintenance Planning**
   - Design life maintenance intervals (example framework):

   | System/Material | Interval | Task | Notes |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Fire apparatus bay sealed concrete floor | Annual | Deep clean; inspect sealant integrity at sumps | Re-seal every 3-5 years (ASSUMPTION; confirm with product data) |
   | Fire apparatus bay epoxy-coated floor (if selected) | Annual | Deep clean; inspect coating integrity at sumps | Recoat every 7-10 years (ASSUMPTION; confirm with product data) |
   | PW bay flooring | Annual | Deep clean; inspect for cracking, oil penetration | Re-seal as needed |
   | Roofing membrane | Annual | Inspection; clear drains; inspect penetrations | Replacement per service life (TBD; estimate 20–25 years for long-life membrane) |
   | Overhead door springs | Annual | Tension check; lubricate rollers; **confirm manufacturer-specified spring cycle life and compare to actual daily use frequency** | Replace springs when worn (ASSUMPTION: 5-10 year life at daily use for fire apparatus bays). **This assumption must be validated with manufacturer data during detailed design (see Step A2, item 3); fire apparatus bay springs are a critical operational component — premature failure could delay emergency response.** *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing E-001.)* |
   | Overhead door weather seals | 5–7 years | Inspect and replace (ASSUMPTION) | "Car wash" grade seals for main building |
   | Exterior cladding | Annual | Inspect; clean | Recoat or reseal per manufacturer (TBD by material selection) |
   | Bay sump | Semi-annual | Inspect; clean debris; inspect edge sealant | Pump-out schedule TBD per volume accumulation; confirm with mechanical |
   | Bunker gear room ventilation | Annual | Inspect exhaust grilles; test air flow | Part of mechanical preventive maintenance program per DEL-05-03 |
   | Concrete aprons | Annual | Inspect for cracks; seal cracks promptly | Salt resistance maintenance critical for aprons in direct apparatus routing path |
   | Cold Storage metal cladding seams | Annual | Inspect seams and fasteners; clear debris from gutters | Low maintenance; check for rust at cut edges |
   | Water fill stations (2", ground level) | Annual | Inspect fittings; check for corrosion at slab penetration | Ground-level location in chemical environment requires corrosion monitoring |

   - Parts availability: All hardware, door components, and finish materials specified as standardized items available regionally from multiple suppliers.
   - O&M manuals: Provided at substantial performance per RFP §7.5 (two hard copies in 3-ring binders + digital copy); include manufacturer warranties for roofing, flooring, doors, and appliances per RFP §7.6.
   - Warranty: 12-month all-inclusive from occupancy permit (per RFP §7.6 — "Twelve (12) month all-inclusive (labour and materials) warranty on all materials and workmanship from the date the occupancy permit is issued"); coordinate with commissioning closeout (PKG-008).

2. Incorporate source evidence throughout: cite RFP, OSR sections, and Addendum 03 items.
3. Mark any undetermined selections as **TBD — to be confirmed during detailed design**.
4. Target length: 2,000–3,500 words.

**Output:** Draft narrative document.

## Notes

- **Proposal format:** Narrative must follow the formatting conventions established by the Proposal Manager for the formal submission package.
- **Material specificity:** If material selections are not finalized when the narrative is written, mark clearly as **TBD — to be confirmed during detailed design**. Do not invent specifics.
- **O&M manuals:** This narrative provides strategic durability rationale. Detailed maintenance schedules will be documented in O&M manuals delivered at substantial performance per RFP §7.5. Cross-reference this narrative in O&M manual development.
- **Coordination with DEL-05-02 through DEL-05-04:** All four durability narratives (PKG-005) should be reviewed together by the Proposal Manager before final submission to confirm consistent terminology, no contradictions, and no gaps in coverage.
- **Scoring leverage:** With 15 points available, even moving from "Fair" (60%) to "Very Good" (80%) on this criterion is worth 3 additional points on the 100-point scale — potentially decisive in a competitive evaluation. A "Very Good" score requires meeting expectations with high confidence; "Exceptional" requires exceeding expectations and adding innovation.
- **Cold Storage Options 1 and 2:** The Owner explicitly requested pricing for both options (OSR §10.3.8). Both must appear in the proposal; the narrative should explain the recommendation while acknowledging both.
- **Fill stations at ground level:** Addendum 03 §1.16 confirms ground-level installation in both apparatus bay and PW bay. Design must address the slab penetration durability and the corrosion environment at both locations.
