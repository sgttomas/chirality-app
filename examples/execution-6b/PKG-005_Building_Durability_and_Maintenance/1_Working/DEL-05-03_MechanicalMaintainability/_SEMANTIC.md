# Deliverable: DEL-05-03 Mechanical Maintainability

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to articulate a strategy ensuring that all mechanical systems in a combined public-safety and municipal-operations facility remain accessible, serviceable, and lifecycle-optimized throughout the building's operational life. The deliverable must carry knowledge about equipment access, preventive maintenance regimes, standardized component selection, and spare parts provisioning -- from the vantage of an operations-first philosophy that enables non-specialist municipal staff to perform routine service tasks without architectural disruption or proprietary contractor dependence.
