## Assumptions

1. **ASSUMPTION:** Geotechnical report USG1123 (2021) is current and representative of site conditions. No additional geotechnical investigation will be performed; foundation and durability design will rely solely on this report.
   *Source: Decomposition DEC-013 (CLOSED: OI-004 resolved — no additional investigation); RFP §7.3.4.*

2. **ASSUMPTION:** Site is subject to Alberta freeze-thaw cycling and potential de-icing salt exposure. Concrete and steel durability design will comply with Canadian standards for these exposures.
   *Source: Geotechnical Report §5.5; regional context.*

3. **ASSUMPTION:** Apparatus bays and PW bays are classified as "high-moisture, moderate-to-high corrosivity" environments due to vehicle traffic, snow melt, sumps, exhaust ventilation, and occasional chemical exposure.
   *Source: RFP Appendix A (OSR); Addendum 03 §1.8.*

4. **ASSUMPTION:** Slab-on-grade durability (including sump shell construction) is the responsibility of the Structural Engineer in this deliverable. Mechanical coordination (internal drain systems, sump pump specification) is addressed in DEL-05-03.
