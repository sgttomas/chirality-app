## Steps

### Phase A: Proposal Development (Durability Narrative Production)

#### Step A1: Establish Structural System Context

**Objective:** Determine structural system type and identify high-risk durability zones.

**Actions:**
1. Review Structural Concept (DEL-02-03) to confirm:
   - Primary structural frame material (steel frame, concrete, or hybrid)
   - Foundation system type (shallow footings, driven piles, screw piles)
   - Slab-on-grade locations; sump locations in apparatus and PW bays
   - Roof system and slope (affects drainage and maintenance access)

2. Identify high-corrosivity zones based on known RFP and Addendum 03 requirements:
   - **Apparatus bays:** snow melt (sumps required), vehicle salt tracking, 16 ft overhead doors (outdoor-interior cycling)
   - **PW bays:** similar to apparatus bays; welding fumes; maintenance fluids
   - **Cold Storage:** unheated; condensation cycling; vehicle traffic
   - **Foundation perimeter:** in-ground contact with potentially S-2 sulphate clay/till

3. Document zone classifications in a working table:

| Zone | Exposure Class | Concrete Strategy | Steel Strategy |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Foundation (below grade) | S-2 sulphate + frost | Type HS cement; w/c ≤ 0.45; 32 MPa @ 56 days; air-entrained | C2 paint or equivalent |
| Apparatus/PW bay slab | Freeze-thaw + C3 chloride | Air-entrained; low w/c; sealed joints; 150 mm Radon Rock; CAN/CGSB-51.34-M barrier | C3 — galvanized or enhanced paint |
| Apparatus/PW bay frame (interior) | C3 (high — salt, moisture) | N/A | Hot-dip galvanized (ASTM A123) or enhanced paint, DFT ≥150 µm |
| Protected exterior frame | C2 (moderate) | N/A | Standard paint, DFT ~100 µm |
| Cold Storage frame | C4 (very high — unheated, wet) | N/A | Hot-dip galvanized (ASTM A123) |
| Bay sumps | Freeze-thaw + S-2 + chloride immersion | Type HS cement; interior protection per Specification R-STR-13 approved options (epoxy coating, stainless steel lining, or high-density concrete with integral waterproofing) | C3--C4 at sump perimeter |

#### Step A2: Confirm Site Conditions and Design Life

**Objective:** Anchor the durability narrative to specific, cited geotechnical parameters and RFP-stated design life.

**Actions:**
1. Extract from Geotechnical Investigation Report (USG1123):
   - Frost penetration depth: **2.0 m** below finished grade (§5.5.1, p. 24)
   - Groundwater depth: **approx. 3.0–4.0 m** below grade (§4.2, Table 4.3, p. 8)
   - Sulphate classification: **S-2 (severe) assumed** — no laboratory testing performed (§4.3, p. 8)
   - Frost jacking adfreeze stress: **100 kPa** above 2.0 m depth, fine-grained soil to steel (§5.5.2, p. 24)
   - Minimum driven pile embedment: **5.3 m** for unheated structures (§5.2, §5.5.2)
   - Screw pile helix: must be below **2.0 m** frost depth (§5.3, p. 18)
   - Foundation bearing: sand ULS 300 kPa / SLS 100 kPa; till ULS 360 kPa / SLS 120 kPa (§5.4)
   - Frost heave void: min. 100 mm (sand subgrade) or 150 mm (clay subgrade) under pile-supported structures (§5.5.3)
   - Seismic Site Class: **C** (360 < Vs < 760 m/s) (§6, p. 25)
   - Soil profile: topsoil (~72 mm) → Clayey Sand SC (~1.35 m BG) → Clay CH high plasticity (~3.17 m BG) → Till (below ~3.17 m in BH101–BH108)

2. Confirm design life from RFP and decomposition:
   - **Main building:** 50 years
   - **Cold Storage (unheated):** 20 years
   - **Pickled Sand Storage:** removed from project (Addendum 03 §1.2) — do not include

3. Confirm operational environment from RFP Appendix A and Addendum 03:
   - All apparatus and PW bays: sumps required (Addendum 03 §1.8)
   - Overhead door minimum: 16 ft clear height (Addendum 03 §1.10)
   - Flooring: resilient material cleanable of mud and dust, e.g., sealed concrete (Addendum 03 §1.3)
   - Direct exhaust ventilation in fire apparatus bays (Addendum 03 §1.12) — implies moisture management requirement

#### Step A3: Develop Material Selection Philosophy

**Objective:** Define the material and protective system strategy aligned to 50-year durability.

**Actions:**
1. **Concrete below grade (sulphate + frost exposure):**
   - Type HS Portland cement (or Type 10 + ~25% Type F or CI fly ash)
   - w/c ≤ 0.45; minimum 32 MPa @ 56 days
   - No calcium chloride; no chloride-bearing admixtures; no calcium salt accelerators
   - Air entrainment per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Clause 4.3.3 and Table 4
   - Cold-weather placement: comply with CAN/CSA-A23.1 cold weather provisions

2. **Slab on grade (freeze-thaw + chloride exposure):**
   - Air entrainment per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014
   - Low w/c ratio; minimum strength per structural design
   - 150 mm Radon Rock base (20 mm screened/washed); CAN/CGSB-51.34-M vapour barrier sealed
   - Subgrade compaction min. 98% SPDD (ASTM D698); 100% for fills >1.2 m
   - Sealed control joints (polyurethane or epoxy sealant)

3. **Structural steel:**
   - C2 zones: conventional paint (epoxy primer + ester/acrylic topcoat; DFT ~100 µm); zinc-plated fasteners
   - C3 zones (bay areas): hot-dip galvanized (ASTM A123) OR enhanced paint (epoxy primer + polyurethane topcoat; DFT ≥150 µm); stainless steel (304 grade) fasteners
   - C4 zones (Cold Storage): hot-dip galvanized (ASTM A123); stainless steel (316 grade) fasteners

4. **Foundation:**
   - Select one system per structure (see Guidance C-004)
   - Type HS concrete for all below-grade elements
   - Ensure frost depth protection and positive drainage

5. Document selections in a **Material Selection Table** for inclusion in the proposal narrative.

#### Step A4: Address Accessibility and Maintenance

**Objective:** Design the structure so that 50-year inspection and maintenance do not require extraordinary measures.

**Actions:**
1. Review structural plan and sections from DEL-02-03:
   - Identify structural elements exposed and accessible from inside bays
   - Identify sump locations and preliminary sump depth
   - Identify roof penetrations and heavy equipment mounting locations

2. Plan for accessibility:
   - **Walkways:** Identify inspection routes on roof and elevated areas for visual inspection
   - **Sump inspection:** Design sump cover/grating to allow visual inspection and pump removal; opening sized ≥18" × 24" (or as required); avoid deep buried sumps requiring excavation
   - **Connection visibility:** Ensure structural connections in C3/C4 zones are accessible for touch-up and inspection
   - **Joint sealing:** Define control joint pattern with sealant inspection accessibility in mind

3. Draft a preliminary **Maintenance Access Plan** (working document) covering:
   - Annual visual inspection route (exterior slabs, joints, sump, painted surfaces in bay areas)
   - Estimated time and cost for routine maintenance tasks
   - Inspection intervals aligned to maintenance schedule (Step D2 of this procedure)

#### Step A5: Coordinate with Other Durability Deliverables

**Objective:** Ensure structural narrative integrates with Architectural (DEL-05-01), Mechanical (DEL-05-03), and Electrical (DEL-05-04) narratives.

**Actions:**
1. Coordinate with **DEL-05-01 (Architectural Durability):**
   - Confirm cladding/sealant strategy at cladding-frame interface (affects moisture management and corrosion protection in bay zones)
   - Confirm roofing material/lifespan (affects roof drainage and structural waterproofing details)
   - Confirm interior finishes strategy in apparatus/PW bays (affects slab cleaning and chemical exposure)

2. Coordinate with **DEL-05-03 (Mechanical Maintainability):**
   - Sump drainage: Confirm pump outlet size, overflow elevation, drain routing (needed before sump detail design)
   - HVAC condensation drainage provisions in apparatus bay exhaust system
   - Equipment layout to ensure maintenance access without disturbing structure

3. Coordinate with **DEL-05-04 (Electrical Maintainability):**
   - Electrical panel location: Confirm accessibility; avoid high-moisture/corrosive areas
   - Conduit routing through structural elements: Confirm sealed penetration details

4. Produce an **Interface Coordination Matrix** (working document):

| Interface | Structural Element | Related System | Coordination Point | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Sump drainage | Sump shell, floor slab | Mechanical drain/pump (DEL-05-03) | Sump depth, drain outlet size, drainage slope | TBD |
| Roof penetrations | Roof structure, sealants | HVAC exhaust (mech), conduits (elec) | Sealant detail; penetration reinforcing | TBD |
| Cladding-frame interface | Structural frame (bay zone) | Cladding (arch), moisture barriers (arch) | Drainage detail; frame corrosion protection | TBD |
| Electrical panel | Floor slab, structural wall | Panel location (elec) | Accessibility; proximity to moisture | TBD |

#### Step A6: Draft Durability Narrative

**Objective:** Write the RFP §7.1.4 durability narrative for the structural discipline.

**Content outline:**
1. Introduction (0.5 page): State 50/20-year design life objective; introduce multi-discipline approach; acknowledge site conditions (frost depth 2.0 m, S-2 sulphate, de-icing salt, heavy vehicle traffic).
2. Structural Durability (2–3 pages): Concrete durability (freeze-thaw + sulphate); steel corrosion protection (C2/C3/C4 logic); foundation approach (USG1123 basis); slab and sump design; accessibility design.
3. Lifecycle Cost and Maintenance Plan (0.5–1 page): Annual inspection schedule; expected maintenance tasks and intervals; rough 50-year maintenance cost estimate.
4. Design-Build Delivery (0.25 page): How durability will be confirmed during detailed design; quality control checkpoints (material submittals, concrete testing, coating DFT inspection); O&M manual provisions.

**Quality check:** Narrative addresses all sub-criteria in RFP §7.1.4 (design approach, material selection, construction methods, ease of repair and maintenance). Specific site conditions (USG1123) are cited. Tone is confident, operations-aware, and grounded in evidence.

### Phase B: Detailed Design (Post-Award)

#### Step B1: Foundation Design and Geotechnical Coordination

1. Engage Geotechnical PE (Union Street Geotechnical or successor) to:
   - Review detailed design against USG1123 recommendations

   - Control joint pattern and sealant specification (polyurethane or epoxy)
   - Sump location, size, depth, and interior finish specification per Specification R-STR-13 approved options: (a) epoxy coating, (b) stainless steel lining (304 or 316 grade), or (c) high-density concrete with integral waterproofing admixture -- selection confirmed per Guidance CON-002 resolution *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing F-002 -- terminology normalized to Specification R-STR-13 authoritative shortlist)*

2. Coordinate sump with mechanical engineer:
   - Confirm pump outlet size and drain routing (from DEL-05-03)
   - Confirm overflow elevation, cleanout access dimensions
   - Confirm accessibility classification (confined space or not)

3. Develop sump detail drawings: cross-section; drain outlet; interior lining; grating/cover; reinforcing cage

3. Detail control joint pattern on slab drawings; joint sealant depth and width per specification
4. Create maintenance access drawings: plan view showing walkway locations, sump access, inspection points

---

### Phase C: Construction and Quality Control

#### Step C1: Pre-Construction Meeting and Material Verification

1. Conduct pre-construction meeting with contractor, concrete supplier, and coating contractor to review:
   - All concrete durability specs (air content, w/c ratio, Type HS for below-grade, curing protocol)
   - Coating spec (paint system, DFT, surface preparation standard)
   - Galvanizing spec (ASTM A123, zinc thickness, inspection protocol)
   - Sump detail and interior lining application procedure
   - Testing protocol (concrete strength, air content, coating DFT)

2. Review and approve material submittals before any work begins:
   - Concrete mix design: verify air content, w/c ratio, cement type
   - Cement certification: Type HS confirmed
   - Paint products: compatibility verified (primer + topcoat), SDS reviewed
   - Galvanizing: ASTM A123 compliance confirmed
   - Epoxy/lining: compatibility with concrete; cure time noted

#### Step C2: Foundation and Below-Grade Concrete Construction

1. Pre-pour inspection: formwork sound; reinforcing correct; drain layer and perimeter subdrain properly placed; geotech PE present to inspect bearing surface
2. **MANDATORY HOLD POINT (H-C2-1):** Foundation pour shall not proceed until the Geotechnical PE has inspected and approved the bearing surface in writing. Construction shall not advance past this point without documented sign-off. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing A-004)*
3. Concrete placement: verify Type HS cement (check delivery ticket); monitor slump and air content on-site; proper consolidation; cold-weather provisions in effect if applicable
4. Post-pour: inspect for cracking or defects; verify drainage function; strength samples to lab
5. Testing: 7, 28, 56-day strength samples; confirm 56-day strength >= 32 MPa for Type HS below-grade concrete

#### Step C3: Slab on Grade and Sump Construction

1. Base course: verify Radon Rock layer (150 mm minimum, 20 mm screened rock); verify vapour barrier (CAN/CGSB-51.34-M) installed and sealed before reinforcing placement
2. **MANDATORY HOLD POINT (H-C3-1):** Slab pour shall not proceed until the vapour barrier inspection is complete and signed off. Inspector must confirm CAN/CGSB-51.34-M sheeting continuity, sealing at all joints and penetrations, and no tears or gaps. Construction shall not advance past this point without documented sign-off. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing A-004)*
3. Subgrade compaction: density testing at minimum 1 test per 500 m² of structural fill
4. Concrete placement: monitor air content (per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 requirement); slump and consolidation; sump reinforcing cage placement and concrete consolidation around sump
5. Sump drain outlet: verify correct size and no blockage before pour
6. Joint placement: cut control joints at correct intervals; install backer rod; apply sealant with correct depth, width, and cure time
7. Epoxy lining (after slab/sump cure): surface preparation (power wash, acid etch); epoxy application and cure; holiday detection (void/pinhole detection test) before accepting lining
8. Testing: air content on-site; strength cylinders (28, 56-day); DFT of epoxy lining; holiday detection report

#### Step C4: Structural Steel Fabrication and Coating

1. **Shop (fabrication):** verify coating schedule in shop drawings; pre-coating inspection (surface profile, cleanliness); monitor paint application and DFT; monitor galvanizing process (ASTM A123; zinc thickness >=70 um); package and protect coated members for transport
2. **Field assembly:** inspect for coating damage on arrival; touch-up as required per specification; do not field weld on galvanized members without post-weld zinc-rich epoxy touch-up (grind weld area first)
3. **Field galvanizing verification (post-transport):** After erection of galvanized members, perform visual inspection of all galvanized surfaces for transport and handling damage (scratches, abrasion, bare spots). Measure zinc thickness with a calibrated coating gauge on a representative sample of installed members (minimum 1 measurement per 5 members or 1 per bay, whichever is greater). Any area where zinc thickness is below 70 um or where bare steel is exposed shall be repaired with zinc-rich epoxy primer per ASTM A780 within 7 days of identification. **WITNESS POINT (W-C4-1):** Owner's representative or independent inspector may witness galvanizing field verification. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing X-001 -- galvanizing field verification gap)*
4. **Field inspection:** DFT spot checks on field welds and repairs; visual inspection of fasteners (confirm stainless steel in C3--C4 zones)

#### Step C5: Final Inspection and Commissioning

1. Structural walk-through: inspect all concrete surfaces (slab, foundation) for cracking, spalling, or joint sealant loss; inspect structural steel for coating damage; inspect sump condition
2. Compile documentation: concrete testing reports; coating inspection reports; O&M manual (structural section); as-built drawings
3. Punch list: identify defects; contractor corrects within warranty period
4. Handover: provide Owner with maintenance schedule, inspection checklist, material datasheets for future touch-up

---

### Phase D: Operations and Maintenance (Post-Occupancy)

#### Step D1: Annual Inspection

**Perform each spring (recommended, after freeze-thaw season):**

| Item | What to Look For | Threshold for Action |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Exterior slabs and foundation | Spalling, scaling, cracking, salt staining | Spalling or scaling: repair immediately; hairline cracks (<1.5 mm): monitor |
| Sump interior | Epoxy lining damage or delamination; drain outlet blockage | Damaged lining: repair; blocked drain: clean |
| Structural steel (bay areas) | Paint peeling, rust spots, fastener corrosion | Rust spots: clean and touch up within 1 year; major corrosion: engineer review |
| Control joints | Sealant loss, cracking, water infiltration | Sealant loss: plan re-sealing within 1 season |
| Roof penetrations | Sealant condition, water damage around penetrations | Active leaks: repair immediately |

#### Step D2: Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Interval | Action | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Visual inspection (slabs, foundation, joints, sump, painted surfaces) | Annual (spring) | Walk-through inspection; document findings with photos | Low (~$500–$1,000/year) |
| Joint sealant reapplication | Every 3–5 years | Chip out old sealant; apply new polyurethane or epoxy sealant | Moderate (~$2,000–$5,000 per round) |
| Paint touch-up (painted steel C3 zones) | Every 5–8 years | Clean surface; apply primer + topcoat to any rust or peeling areas | Moderate (~$1,000–$3,000 per round) |
| Structural coating inspection with DFT measurement | Every 10 years | Professional coating inspector; measures DFT; recommends repairs | Moderate (~$2,000–$4,000 per inspection) |
| Major coating repair or repaint (if painted) | Year 25–30 (as needed) | Strip and repaint entire structure if substantial degradation | High (~$50,000–$150,000+) |
| Galvanized steel inspection | Every 10–15 years | Visual inspection for white rust or bare spots; minimal action expected | Low (~$500–$1,000 per inspection) |
| Sump inspection and cleaning | Annually or semi-annually | Pump out; inspect epoxy lining; clean sediment; verify drain outlet | Low (~$500–$1,500/year) |
| Foundation perimeter drain inspection | Every 5–10 years | Visual inspection; ensure no blockage or backflow | Low (~$1,000–$2,000 per inspection) |
| Structural coating specialist inspection | Year 10; Year 25; Year 40 | Full professional inspection; DFT survey; repair recommendations | Moderate (~$3,000–$5,000 per inspection) |

**Note on galvanized vs. painted steel lifecycle:** Hot-dip galvanized structural steel (ASTM A123, 70+ µm zinc thickness) in a C3 environment (apparatus bay) has an expected service life of 40–50 years before significant maintenance is needed. This is a key advantage of galvanizing over paint for the 50-year design life.

#### Step D3: Maintenance Log and Record-Keeping

Maintain a running log including:
- Inspection reports (date, findings, photos)
- Maintenance work orders (date, work, contractor, cost)
- Materials used (paint lot number, epoxy product, sealant type)
- Test results (strength test reports, coating inspection reports)
- Warranty information (cement certification, paint warranties, epoxy lining warranties)
