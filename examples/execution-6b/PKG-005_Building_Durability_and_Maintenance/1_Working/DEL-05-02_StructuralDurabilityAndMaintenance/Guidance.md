# Guidance: Structural Durability and Maintenance

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-05-02
**Document Type:** Directional (Rationale & Context)
**Version:** Draft (Pass 3 -- Semantic Lensing Enrichment)

---

## Purpose

This document provides strategic rationale, principles, and considerations for the Structural Durability and Maintenance narrative (DEL-05-02). It explains **why** specific durability approaches are appropriate for the Penhold Public Services Building, given its 50-year design life, operational environment (fire apparatus, heavy equipment), and site conditions from the 2021 geotechnical investigation (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File USG1123): frost penetration depth of 2.0 m, groundwater at 3.0–4.0 m below grade, severe sulphate exposure class S-2 (assumed), and frost-active high-plasticity clay subgrade.

---

## Principles

### P-001: Design Life Drives Material Selection

**Rationale:** A 50-year main building and 20-year Cold Storage require fundamentally different material strategies than typical 30-year structures.

**Application:**
- **50-year structures** demand superior corrosion protection, high-quality concrete with protective measures, and systems designed for minimal maintenance during the design life.
- **20-year structures** (Cold Storage, unheated) may accept simpler, lower-cost solutions with planned major rehabilitation or replacement at end-of-life, but must still handle the freeze-thaw and moisture environment of an unheated Alberta building.

**Why it matters:** The RFP explicitly scores durability at 15 evaluation points (OBJ-005, second-highest technical weight). Demonstrating a credible 50-year strategy directly supports proposal competitiveness.

### P-002: Site Conditions Dictate Protective Measures

**Rationale:** The 2021 geotechnical report (USG1123) identifies specific site risks that must drive structural material choices:

| Site Condition | Key Parameter | Required Design Response |
|---|---|---|
| Severe sulphate soil (S-2 assumed) | Lab testing not done; conservative classification | Type HS cement, w/c ≤ 0.45, min. 32 MPa @ 56 days; no chloride admixtures |
| Frost depth 2.0 m | Historical Penhold temperature data | Foundation depth min. 2.0 m (unheated); pile embedment min. 5.3 m; screw pile helix below 2.0 m |
| Frost-active clay (MUSC CH) | High plasticity, significant volume change | Void space under pile-supported structures (100–150 mm); avoid unheated on-grade slabs on clay as sole system |
| Adfreeze (frost jacking) on piles | 100 kPa above 2.0 m depth, steel to fine-grained soil | Minimum driven pile length 5.3 m; full dead load on piles prior to winter |
| Groundwater 3.0–4.0 m below grade | Piezometer readings Feb. 2021 | Perimeter drainage; positive grading; no ponding adjacent to foundation |

**Why it matters:** Insufficient durability measures lead to structural deterioration, costly repairs, and potential safety risks (concrete spalling from freeze-thaw, salt-induced reinforcement corrosion, foundation movement from frost jacking). A narrative that demonstrates site-specific awareness scores higher on OBJ-005.

---

### P-003: Accessibility Supports Maintainability

**Rationale:** A 50-year structure requires periodic inspection and maintenance. Structural elements must be designed so that inspection and touch-up do not require temporary shoring, special equipment, or extraordinary effort.

**Application:**
- **Walkways on roof:** Allow safe access for visual inspection of roof penetrations, sealant conditions, and coating condition without ladder work on a sloped surface.
- **Sump accessibility:** Sumps are high-risk zones for freeze-thaw damage and salt accumulation. Design should permit visual inspection of sump interior and easy pump or drain cleaning without confined space entry (or with clear confined space protocol if unavoidable).
- **Structural connection visibility:** Bolted and welded connections in high-corrosivity zones should be visually inspectable and accessible for coating touch-up.
- **Joint sealing:** Control joints in slabs should be sealed to prevent water infiltration; design should allow for periodic sealant re-application without major excavation.

**Why it matters:** The RFP explicitly scores "ease of repair and maintenance" (RFP §7.1.4). Demonstrating that the design supports routine maintenance without special equipment or high cost directly supports the OBJ-005 score.

### P-004: Discipline Separation Ensures Completeness

**Rationale:** Durability depends on contributions from multiple disciplines: Structural (corrosion protection, concrete durability, foundation), Architectural (cladding moisture management, roof design), Mechanical (sump drainage, HVAC condensation management), Electrical (cable tray moisture protection).

**Application:**
- **DEL-05-02 (this deliverable)** focuses on **structural systems**: concrete durability, steel corrosion, foundation longevity, slab durability, sump shell construction, and element accessibility.
- **DEL-05-01** (Architectural Durability): exterior finishes, roofing, interior finishes for the operations environment, moisture management at the building envelope.
- **DEL-05-03** (Mechanical Maintainability): equipment access, replacement strategy, filter maintenance, sump drainage system.
- **DEL-05-04** (Electrical Maintainability): panel access, lighting fixture lifecycle, conduit/cable tray protection.

**Why it matters:** The decomposition decision DEC-009 splits OBJ-005 into four discipline-level deliverables to ensure no discipline is overlooked and responsibility is clear. Each narrative must explicitly address its scope and coordinate with the others.

## Considerations

### C-001: Freeze-Thaw vs. First Cost

- **High air entrainment + low w/c ratio** → superior freeze-thaw resistance but higher concrete cost (approx. 5–10%)
- **Minimal air, normal w/c** → lower cost but higher deterioration risk and future patching/replacement costs
- **Consideration:** For a 50-year facility, the upfront cost of air-entrained concrete is recovered by avoiding mid-life slab rehabilitation (chipping, patching, or full slab replacement at year 25–30).
- **Recommendation:** Specify air-entrained concrete for all freeze-thaw exposed slabs and exterior concrete. Accept the modest cost increase.

*Source: CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 (freeze-thaw durability); RFP design life requirement.*

### C-002: Sulphate Attack vs. Foundation Cost

- **Type HS cement + low w/c ratio** → approximately 10–15% higher concrete cost
- **No additional protection** → risk of spalling, cracking, and foundation distress by year 30–40
- **Key consideration:** The 2021 geotechnical report (USG1123 §4.3) confirms sulphate testing was NOT performed. The S-2 (severe) classification is a conservative design assumption.
  - **If post-award detailed design testing reveals lower sulphate levels**, concrete specification may be relaxed by the design engineer.
  - **If S-2 is confirmed**, Type HS (or Type 10 + 25% fly ash) is mandatory per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014.
- **Recommendation:** Design for S-2 now (safer, conservative); note in narrative that detailed foundation design may adjust specification if future testing clarifies soil conditions. This is a strength, not a weakness — it demonstrates professional judgment.

*Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report (USG1123) §4.3; Decomposition DEC-013 (no additional investigation at proposal stage).*

### C-003: Steel Corrosion Protection vs. Lifecycle Cost

- **Paint systems (C3 class, DFT ~150 µm):** Moderate cost; requires touch-up every 5–8 years
- **Hot-dip galvanizing (C3–C4):** Higher upfront cost (~15% premium over painted); minimal maintenance for 40+ years
- **Stainless steel (C4):** Highest cost; essentially maintenance-free for 50+ years
- **Consideration:** Apparatus bays and PW bays are where vehicle traffic, moisture, snow melt, and salt exposure are highest. A galvanized or stainless solution for structural elements in these zones has lower lifecycle cost over 50 years than frequent paint touch-up.
- **Recommendation:** Use hot-dip galvanizing (ASTM A123) for structural steel in bay areas (C3 zones); conventional enhanced paint for protected exterior frame (C2 zones). Stainless steel fasteners at all C3–C4 connection details.

### C-004: Foundation Type Selection

The 2021 geotechnical report (USG1123) provides recommendations for three foundation systems:

| Foundation Type | Best For | Key Durability Consideration |
|---|---|---|
| Shallow spread footings | Light/moderate loads; insulated/heated structures | Must be ≥ 2.0 m deep (frost); min. 0.50 m buffer above clay when bearing on sand; Type HS concrete |
| Driven steel pipe piles | Moderate-to-heavy loads; unheated structures | Min. 5.3 m embedment; adfreeze 100 kPa above 2.0 m; geotechnical resistance φ = 0.4 (compression) |
| Screw piles | Light-to-moderate loads; removable | Upper helix below 2.0 m frost depth; advantage: can be removed; disadvantage: helix may disturb clay |

**Note:** A single foundation system type per structure is recommended (USG1123 Summary item 5, p. 10) — do not mix systems supporting the same structure.

*Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report (USG1123) §5.2, §5.3, §5.4.*

### C-005A: Carbonation-Induced Corrosion over 50-Year Design Life

- **What is carbonation?** Atmospheric CO2 reacts with calcium hydroxide in concrete, gradually reducing the alkalinity of the concrete cover. When the carbonation front reaches the reinforcement, the passive oxide layer on the rebar is destabilized and corrosion can initiate even without chloride exposure.
- **Is it a material risk for this project?** For the 50-year main building design life, carbonation is a recognized long-term degradation mechanism for above-grade concrete elements. However, the concrete quality specified in this deliverable (low w/c ratio of 0.45, air entrainment, minimum 32 MPa strength) significantly slows carbonation penetration. High-quality concrete with w/c <= 0.45 typically has carbonation depths of 10--15 mm at 50 years in temperate climates.
- **Consideration:** If minimum concrete cover depths (per B-001, TBD) are specified at or above CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Table 17 minimums for the applicable exposure class (typically 30--40 mm for exterior exposed concrete), the combination of low w/c and adequate cover is expected to provide sufficient carbonation protection for 50 years without additional measures.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm that minimum concrete cover depths, once specified, exceed the expected 50-year carbonation front depth for the concrete quality specified. No additional carbonation-specific measures are expected to be required, but this should be verified during detailed design.

**ASSUMPTION:** Carbonation risk assessment is based on general concrete technology principles for w/c <= 0.45 concrete in temperate Alberta climate. Site-specific carbonation testing has not been performed.

### C-005B: Structural Health Monitoring Instrumentation

- **Context:** The Guidance addresses visual inspection thoroughly (Procedure Phase D), but does not discuss whether embedded structural health monitoring (SHM) instrumentation is appropriate for a 50-year public infrastructure facility.
- **What is SHM?** Embedded sensors (crack gauges, corrosion rate sensors on rebar, strain gauges, moisture sensors) installed during construction to provide ongoing data on concealed structural deterioration that visual inspection cannot detect.
- **Trade-off:**
  - **For instrumentation:** Early detection of concealed deterioration (e.g., rebar corrosion under intact concrete surface, foundation settlement); supports data-driven maintenance decisions; relatively low cost if installed during construction (est. $5,000--$15,000 for a targeted sensor array).
  - **Against instrumentation:** Adds design complexity; sensors have their own maintenance needs (battery replacement, data retrieval); false positives can trigger unnecessary investigations; for a relatively small municipal facility with good-quality materials, visual inspection may be sufficient.
- **Recommendation:** SHM instrumentation is not recommended as a baseline requirement for this project at the proposal stage. The combination of high-quality materials (Type HS concrete, galvanized steel, air entrainment), adequate cover depths, and a robust visual inspection program (Procedure Phase D) provides sufficient durability assurance. However, if the Owner wishes to adopt a more proactive monitoring approach, the design should not preclude future installation of SHM sensors (i.e., do not permanently conceal critical structural elements).

**ASSUMPTION:** Assessment is based on project scale (municipal public services building) and the robustness of the specified material and inspection regime. Larger or more critical infrastructure may warrant SHM as a baseline.

### C-005: Sump Design Complexity

**Structural vs. Mechanical Responsibilities:**
- **Structural (this deliverable):** Sump shell design, concrete protection (cement type, air entrainment, w/c ratio, interior lining), reinforcing detailing, load transfer, accessibility.
- **Mechanical (DEL-05-03):** Sump interior drainage (pump outlet, overflow), filter or strainer, drain line sizing, pump specification.
- **Shared:** Sump depth, internal dimensions, accessibility for cleaning.

**Recommendation:** Define sump depth, dimensions, and drain outlet location at Conceptual Design phase (with DEL-02-03 structural concept). Confirm drainage requirements with mechanical engineer (DEL-05-03 author). Detail sump reinforcing and interior finish during 60% design phase.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Design Life vs. First Cost

- **50-year design life** mandates investment in superior materials and protective systems upfront (Type HS cement, galvanizing, quality control testing).
- **Lower-cost "30-year" approach** would accept lower-grade concrete, minimal protection, and planned mid-life replacement/repair.
- **RFP expectation:** The Town expects a credible 50-year design for the main building. Lower-cost approaches will score poorly on OBJ-005 (15 pts).
- **Recommendation:** Justify 50-year durability approach in the narrative; acknowledge upfront cost and explain the lifecycle cost benefit clearly. This supports a strong OBJ-005 score.

*Source: RFP §7.1.4; Decomposition OBJ-005.*

### T-002: Inspection Access vs. Structural Simplicity

- **Designed-for-accessibility:** Walkways, sump inspection openings, exposed connections, joint inspection ability.
- **Minimal-access:** Buried sumps, inaccessible connections, sealed-off structural elements.
- **Trade-off:** Accessibility design adds some complexity and cost but is essential for 50-year maintenance strategy.
- **Recommendation:** Embrace accessibility design; it directly addresses the "ease of repair and maintenance" scoring sub-criterion in RFP §7.1.4.

*Source: RFP §7.1.4.*

### T-003: Conservative vs. Test-Based Sulphate Design

- **Conservative (S-2 assumption):** Higher concrete cost; guaranteed durability; no surprises.
- **Test-based (post-award testing):** Potential for cost savings if sulphate levels are lower; introduces a design iteration.
- **Recommendation:** For the proposal narrative, commit to S-2 (conservative). State that post-award sulphate testing will be conducted to confirm or refine the specification. This is both transparent and defensible.

## Examples

### EX-001: Apparatus Bay Slab with Integrated Sump

**Scenario:** Apparatus bays (fire truck parking and servicing) require a slab that can withstand:
- Freeze-thaw cycling (outdoor Alberta climate; frost depth 2.0 m at Penhold)
- De-icing salt tracking (vehicle wheels and boots)
- Heavy vehicle traffic (fire apparatus, service vehicles)
- Snow melt water collected in bay sumps

**Durable Design Approach:**
1. **Slab concrete:** Air-entrained (per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Table 4), low water-cement ratio (≤0.45), minimum 35 MPa compressive strength, reinforced per structural design.
2. **Base course:** Minimum 150 mm of 20 mm Radon Rock on compacted native sand subgrade (min. 98% SPDD per ASTM D698).
3. **Vapour/radon barrier:** CAN/CGSB-51.34-M polyethylene sheeting, sealed, between Radon Rock and slab.
4. **Sump:** Cast as integral part of slab; interior surface protected per Specification R-STR-13 approved options: (a) epoxy coating, (b) stainless steel lining (304 or 316 grade), or (c) high-density concrete with integral waterproofing admixture -- selection TBD during detailed design; drain outlet sized per mechanical design (DEL-05-03); reinforcing detail manages local stress concentration; accessible cover/grating for inspection. *(Enrichment: Semantic Lensing F-002 -- terminology normalized to Specification R-STR-13 authoritative shortlist)*
5. **Surface finish:** Sealed control joint pattern with polyurethane or epoxy joint sealant; epoxy surface treatment (optional upgrade) to reduce salt ingress and facilitate cleaning.
6. **Maintenance plan:** Inspect sump and sealant annually (spring recommended, after freeze-thaw season); touch up sealant every 3–5 years; inspect epoxy coating condition every 5 years.

**Why this works:** Air entrainment and low w/c resist freeze-thaw. Vapour barrier prevents radon and moisture migration. Interior sump lining resists salt immersion. Sealed joints prevent salt tracking into slab interior. Maintenance plan is straightforward.

### EX-002: Structural Steel in Fire Apparatus Bay

**Scenario:** The main structural frame supporting the fire apparatus bay roof is exposed to humidity, vehicle exhaust fumes, and salt spray (from vehicle wheels and boots tracking in snow/salt).

**Durable Design Approach:**
1. **Material selection:** Hot-dip galvanized structural steel (ASTM A123) OR enhanced paint-protected steel with ISO 12944 C3 specification (epoxy primer + polyurethane topcoat, DFT ≥150 µm).
2. **Fasteners:** Stainless steel (304 or 316 grade) bolts, nuts, and washers at all connections in the bay area.
3. **Connections:** Designed to avoid crevices and water traps where possible; sealed connection details in highest-moisture locations.
4. **Inspection access:** Annual visual inspection for paint or galvanizing damage; spot repair with compatible coating system.
5. **Touch-up plan:** Minor damage repaired within 1 year; major coating degradation (if any) addressed within 5 years.

**Why this works:** Galvanizing or enhanced paint provides initial protection rated for 40+ years in C3 environments. Stainless fasteners eliminate fastener corrosion. Annual inspection catches problems early before they escalate to structural damage.

### EX-003: Foundation in Sulphate and Frost Conditions

**Scenario:** The building foundation sits on glacial deposits including high-plasticity clay and till. Sulphate exposure class S-2 (severe) assumed per USG1123. Frost depth is 2.0 m.

**Durable Design Approach:**
1. **Foundation type:** Driven steel pipe piles (open-end, terminating in till; min. 5.3 m embedment) OR shallow spread footings on native sand/till (min. 2.0 m depth, bearing surface inspected and approved by geotechnical PE before pour).
2. **Below-grade concrete:** Type HS Portland cement (or Type 10 + ~25% Class F/CI fly ash); w/c ≤ 0.45; minimum 32 MPa @ 56 days; air entrained for frost protection; no calcium chloride or chloride-bearing accelerators.
3. **Frost heave provision (if pile-supported):** Minimum 100 mm void (sand subgrade) or 150 mm void (clay subgrade) between underside of pile-supported structure and subgrade.
4. **Drainage:** Finished grade sloped min. 3% over 3.0 m away from building; perimeter subdrain at footing level for below-grade walls; no ponding adjacent to foundation.
5. **Documentation:** Material submittals confirming cement type, w/c ratio, and strength testing; concrete testing protocol in contract specifications.
6. **Cold Storage (unheated):** Driven piles or screw piles preferred over shallow footings; avoid unheated on-grade slab directly on clay without adequate void provision.

**Why this works:** Type HS cement and low w/c ratio resist sulphate attack per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014. 5.3 m pile embedment resists frost jacking (100 kPa adfreeze stress). Void space accommodates frost heave. Drainage prevents water saturation at foundation. Air entrainment protects against freeze-thaw.

## Considerations for Narrative Writing

The RFP asks (§7.1.4): *"Describe the approach to building durability (both exterior and interior), including design approach, selection of various systems, components, materials, and construction methods used. Also describe the ease of repair and maintenance of the building and all systems and components."*

**Recommended narrative structure for the structural section:**

1. **Introduction (0.5 page):** State the 50/20-year design life objective. Reference that this is a multi-discipline narrative (Structural, Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical). Acknowledge site conditions: frost depth 2.0 m, sulphate Class S-2, de-icing salt environment.

2. **Structural Durability — Core Content (2–3 pages):**
   - Concrete durability: air entrainment, low w/c ratio, Type HS cement for below-grade — explain why (sulphate + freeze-thaw)
   - Steel corrosion protection: paint systems and galvanizing per exposure class — explain the C2/C3/C4 logic
   - Foundation approach: based on USG1123 recommendations; Type HS concrete; drainage; frost protection depth; single system per structure
   - Slab-on-grade and sump design: radon rock base, vapour barrier, air-entrained slab, sump accessibility
   - Design for accessibility: walkways, sump access, joint inspection, connection visibility

3. **Lifecycle Cost and Maintenance Plan (0.5–1 page):**
   - Annual inspection schedule (visual inspection, spring preferred)
   - Expected maintenance tasks and intervals (sealant reapplication every 3–5 years; galvanized = minimal maintenance for 40+ years)
   - Rough order-of-magnitude estimate for 50-year maintenance

4. **Design-Build Delivery Confirmation (0.25 page):**
   - How durability strategy will be confirmed and refined during detailed design
   - Construction quality control checkpoints (material submittals, concrete testing, coating DFT inspection)
   - O&M manual and as-built documentation provisions

**Tone:** Professional, confident, operations-aware. The Owner (Town of Penhold) operates a fire hall and public works facility. The evaluators will look for evidence that the team understands the site-specific challenges (frost, sulphate, salt tracking, heavy vehicle traffic) and has selected materials and systems to address them systematically.
