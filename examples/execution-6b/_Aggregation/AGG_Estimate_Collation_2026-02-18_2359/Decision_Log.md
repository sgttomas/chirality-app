# Decision Log — AGG_Estimate_Collation_2026-02-18_2359

| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| DEC-AGG-001 | DEL-01-04/05 construction pricing lines classified by CBS prefix (CON.*) rather than Method column | DEL-01-04 uses Method=RATE_TABLE for most construction lines because the estimation METHOD was rate-table-based, but the COST NATURE is construction pricing, not proposal production. The CBS codes (CON.STR, CON.ENV, etc.) definitively identify cost nature. LineIDs starting with B-* and C-* are construction; A-* are production. | Ensures correct separation of production vs construction pricing in rollups |
| DEC-AGG-002 | DEL-01-03 lines L-004 through L-007 classified as FINANCIAL_ALLOWANCE, not CONSTRUCTION_PRICING | Bond premiums and insurance premiums are financial costs of the proposal/contract, not construction scope items. They are also not production hours. The BOE directs these to be reported separately as "PKG-001 financial allowances". | Separate reporting line in project totals |
| DEC-AGG-003 | DEL-01-05 (Schedule B) construction pricing treated as INTENTIONAL DUPLICATE of DEL-01-04 (Schedule A) | DEL-01-05 Assumptions_Log ASM-01 states "Schedule B construction content mirrors DEL-01-04 pricing exactly". Both report the same $7,710,000 in construction pricing. Schedule A is summary form; Schedule B is detailed breakdown of the same numbers. | Construction pricing reported as $7,710,000 (single count) with 41 duplicate pairs documented in Duplicates.csv. Project_Summary_WBS.csv shows both for transparency. |
| DEC-AGG-004 | Bond premium calculation basis conflict flagged but not resolved | DEL-01-03 calculates bond premiums on full $12M contract value; DEL-01-04 B-1110/B-1120 calculate on 50% of $12M ($6M). Both are valid interpretations depending on CCDC 14 contract structure. | Recorded as CONFLICT-001 and CONFLICT-002 in Conflicts.csv for human review |
| DEC-AGG-005 | Building Science Consultant hours (DEL-04-01) classified under "architect" role in Effort_Matrix.csv | The Building Science Consultant (R-27, $165/hr) is an architectural discipline specialist. For the purposes of the effort matrix role aggregation, this is grouped with architectural roles rather than creating a separate row. | 12 hours at $165/hr included in architect row for PKG-004 |
| DEC-AGG-006 | Production hours computed from all lines where CostCategory=PRODUCTION and Unit is HR/hr/HRS | All production lines use hourly units (HR or hr). Financial allowance lines use LS. Construction pricing lines use LS. This provides clean separation for the effort matrix. | 786 total production hours across all 38 deliverables |
| DEC-AGG-007 | PKG-004 (Sustainability) and PKG-010 (Due Diligence) included in Evaluation_Weight_View.csv as N/A point categories | These packages are not separately scored in the RFP evaluation but contribute to the overall proposal. PKG-004 supports the conceptual design score; PKG-010 is supporting documentation. | Included for completeness; no $/point calculated |
