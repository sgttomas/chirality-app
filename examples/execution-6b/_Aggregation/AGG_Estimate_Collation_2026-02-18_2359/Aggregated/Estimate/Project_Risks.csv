N/A,ALL,N/A,No Risk_Register files found in any of the 40 estimate snapshots,N/A,N/A,N/A,Risk registers were not produced as part of the ESTIMATING runs. Project-level risks are documented in the BOE Section 8 Assumptions and Constraints Log and in the individual Assumptions_Log.md files. Key risk areas include: (1) estimated project value assumption ($12M) affecting all percentage-based premiums; (2) fire protection requirement (AHJ determination pending -- $108k at risk); (3) CCIP insurance rate uncertainty (range $180k-$300k); (4) foundation system assumption (screw piles vs alternatives).
