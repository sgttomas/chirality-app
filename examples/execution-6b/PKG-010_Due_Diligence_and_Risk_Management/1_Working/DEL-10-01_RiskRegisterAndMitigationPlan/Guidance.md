# Guidance — Risk Register and Mitigation Plan

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-10-01
**Deliverable Name:** Risk Register and Mitigation Plan
**Package:** PKG-010 — Due Diligence & Risk Management
**Type:** Risk / Register + Narrative
**Responsible Party:** PM + Technical Leads
**Date Generated:** 2026-02-17

## Purpose

The Risk Register and Mitigation Plan exists to serve three audiences simultaneously:

**1. The Evaluation Committee (external):** Signal that the Design-Build team has conducted a disciplined, honest risk assessment and has credible, project-grounded mitigation plans. This directly supports **OBJ-008: Manage risk and unknowns transparently** — a best-effort objective that contributes to evaluator confidence across all scored areas, not just risk management itself. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §6, OBJ-008)

**2. The Project Team (internal):** Establish a baseline risk posture for design and construction decision-making. The register identifies which risks need early attention (long-lead procurement, geotechnical reliance, permitting timeline), which design decisions reduce risk (freezing solar roof orientation early, confirming generator loads at concept stage), and which risks the team is accepting with contingency reserves.

**3. The Pricing and Schedule Disciplines:** Justify contingency reserve allocation and schedule buffers. Risk entries should map to pricing assumptions in DEL-01-06 and schedule milestones in DEL-09-01 — creating a traceable, defensible basis for cost and schedule decisions. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §9, DEL-10-01; DEL-01-06 cross-reference)

## Principles

### P-001 — Project Specificity Over Boilerplate

Every risk entry shall be traceable to an actual project constraint: an RFP requirement, Addendum 03 program item, reference report finding, or confirmed site constraint. Generic risks (e.g., "weather delay") are acceptable only when linked to a project-specific mitigation (e.g., "Alberta winter construction window of November–March requires enclosed foundation work or schedule buffer; mitigation: mobilize in Q3 to complete foundation before freeze-up").

Boilerplate without project-specific grounding undermines OBJ-008. The register is evaluated on whether it reflects that the team understands this project. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §6, OBJ-008)

### P-002 — Addendum 03 as a Risk-Shaping Event

Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024) is the single most risk-significant source document after the base RFP. It both created new design complexity risks and resolved scope ambiguities that previously generated risk. The register shall treat Addendum 03 as a dual-effect event:

- **Risk Introduced:** Coordination complexity across five disciplines for eight new or clarified requirements (16 ft doors, sumps, exhaust, generator, fill stations, solar roof, 40 lockers, room sizing ranges)
- **Risk Reduced:** Scope ambiguity eliminated for certain items (e.g., pickled sand storage building excluded per C-10; site area confirmed at 12 developable acres; FF&E treatment confirmed per DEC-012)

(Source: Decomposition v2.3 §4, Addendum 03 integration; §3, C-10; §13, DEC-012)

### P-003 — Honesty About Residual Risk

Mitigation does not eliminate risk; it reduces it. Every Active risk shall state a residual risk rating (post-mitigation). At least three entries shall retain a non-trivial residual (Medium Likelihood or above after mitigation). This reflects reality and signals to the evaluator that the team has a mature, non-defensive risk culture.

**Do not claim all risks are eliminated.** The evaluator will be skeptical of a register where every risk is marked "Mitigated" with residual = Low-Low. (Source: OBJ-008 transparency principle; ASSUMPTION — consistent with Design-Build evaluation expectations)

### P-004 — Actionable, Owned Mitigations

Every mitigation strategy shall name:
- **What action:** specific and named (not "review risk periodically")
- **Who:** an individual role or party (PM, Lead Architect, Civil Engineer, Estimator)
- **When:** tied to a design milestone (30% DD, 60% DD review, IFC, or procurement timeline) or a decision trigger

**P-004 Example (poor):** "Monitor geotechnical risk throughout design."
**P-004 Example (better):** "Structural Engineer reviews 2021 Geotechnical Report findings against preliminary foundation design at 30% DD milestone; if report coverage gaps identified, Structural Engineer flags to PM for DEC-013 re-evaluation."

(Source: ASSUMPTION — standard Design-Build risk management practice)

### P-005 — Six Category Structure Is Fixed

The six categories (Design, Site/Environmental, Cost, Schedule, Procurement, Permitting) are fixed by SOW-0028. They align with the team's discipline structure (Design → Lead Architect, Site/Environmental → Civil + Structural + Environmental, Cost → Estimator, Schedule + Procurement → Construction Manager + PM, Permitting → PM + Civil). Do not merge or rename categories.

(Source: Decomposition v2.3 §7, SOW-0028)

### P-006 — ISO 31000 as Process Guide (Not Compliance Obligation)

ISO 31000:2018 (Risk Management -- Guidelines) is cited in the Specification Standards table as applicable by industry convention. The RFP does not require ISO 31000 compliance. The register uses ISO 31000 as a **process guide** for structuring risk identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring -- not as a compliance obligation against which the deliverable will be audited. Specifically, the register adopts from ISO 31000:

- **Risk identification** through structured workshop (Step 1) -- aligned with ISO 31000 Clause 6.4.2
- **Risk analysis** using Likelihood x Impact rating (Step 2) -- aligned with ISO 31000 Clause 6.4.3
- **Risk treatment** via four response types: Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept (Step 3) -- aligned with ISO 31000 Clause 6.5
- **Monitoring and review** via post-award update cycle (Records section) -- aligned with ISO 31000 Clause 6.6

Non-conformance to ISO 31000 would not be considered a gap for this deliverable because the standard is applied as best-practice guidance, not a contractual requirement. If the evaluation committee references ISO 31000 expectations, the register's structure is directionally aligned. (**ASSUMPTION**: ISO 31000 is used as a process guide; not cited by RFP as a compliance requirement. Source: Specification.md Standards table.)

### P-007 — DEC-013 Is a Risk-Acceptance Decision, Not a Risk Elimination

DEC-013 (no additional geotechnical investigation) is an accepted business decision at proposal stage. It does not eliminate the risk of encountering ground conditions different from the 2021 report. The register shall candidly state this risk (RISK-SIT-04), note the decision rationale (existing report sufficient for proposal-stage design; no pricing allowance for additional investigation), and document the contingency response (what happens if ground conditions differ from report during construction). (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §13, DEC-013)

---

## Considerations

### C-001 — Site Complexity Creates a Clustered Site/Environmental Risk Set

The 12-acre developable site (of 20-acre total parcel) features multiple overlapping environmental constraints:

- **8-acre flood fringe** (storm pond + dog park): reduces effective layout area; building and parking must fit within 12 confirmed acres. Risk: flood mapping may be more restrictive at boundary level than Decomposition summary suggests. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §4, Addendum 03 §1.1; flood zone mapping reference)
- **Wetland boundaries**: Wetland Assessment defines buffer setbacks that further constrain site layout and access routing. Risk: wetland survey confirmation at detailed design may shift constraints. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §2, Appendix D reference)
- **Environmental assessment findings (Ghostpine)**: Desktop assessment scope and findings may identify areas of concern requiring mitigation during grading/excavation. Risk: unexpected discovery during construction. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §2, Appendix D reference)
- **Geotechnical reliance (2021 report only)**: Foundation design proceeds on single historical report. Risk: conditions may have changed or report may not cover full 12-acre developable footprint. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §13, DEC-013)

These four site risk drivers interact — a site layout restricted by wetland buffers may push the building footprint toward an area with different geotechnical conditions than the 2021 report samples. Civil and Structural Engineers must coordinate on site layout risk interdependencies.

### C-002 — Design Risk Is Concentrated in Addendum 03 Integration

The largest design risk cluster arises from the eight Addendum 03 special requirements that span all five disciplines. The risk is not that any single requirement is technically difficult; rather, it is that **five disciplines must coordinate eight cross-cutting requirements simultaneously** without a defined detailed design basis yet. This coordination risk peaks at the concept design stage (DEL-02-* deliverables) and must be resolved before schematic freeze.

Key integration points requiring early coordination:
- Generator sizing (DEL-02-04 mechanical) and transfer switching (DEL-02-05 electrical) must be coordinated before generator specification is locked
- Solar-capable roof orientation (DEL-02-05 electrical) and roof geometry (DEL-02-01 architectural) must be aligned before structural roof design begins (DEL-02-03)
- Bay sumps (DEL-02-03 structural/slab) and apparatus bay drainage (DEL-02-04 plumbing) must be coordinated before floor slab design is frozen

(Source: Decomposition v2.3 §4, Addendum 03; SOW-0010; DEL-02-* deliverable descriptions)

### C-003 — Cost Risk Is Dominated by Addendum 03 Scope Costing and Market Conditions

Two cost risks require active management:

**RISK-CST-01 (Addendum 03 scope costing):** The eight Addendum 03 items are individually small but collectively significant. An estimator who treats the base RFP functional program as the cost basis without explicitly adding Addendum 03 items will understate the scope. A reconciliation checklist (Addendum 03 items vs. estimate line items) is the primary mitigation.

**RISK-CST-02 (Market escalation):** Design-Build proposals lock pricing at submission; construction may begin 12–18+ months later. Structural steel, mechanical equipment, and overhead doors are exposed to market escalation. The pricing narrative (DEL-01-06) should address escalation assumptions and contingency reserve approach. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §9, DEL-01-06 description)

### C-004 — Permitting Timeline Is a Schedule Risk Driver

The Owner has stated the project is "NOT schedule-driven" (Decomposition v2.3 §1), which provides schedule flexibility. However, this flexibility must not cause the team to underestimate permitting lead times in the schedule. Building permit application requires the 100% IFC Detailed Design Package (a defined milestone per DEL-06-02). AHJ review timelines in Penhold/Red Deer County jurisdiction are TBD but should be assumed at 4-8 weeks minimum unless early engagement with AHJ confirms otherwise.

**Rationale for 4-8 week AHJ review assumption:** This estimate is not grounded in a specific cited source. It is based on general Alberta municipal building permit practice for projects of this scale and complexity (combined occupancy, fire hall use group, multi-building site). The actual AHJ review timeline is a key schedule risk assumption requiring early validation -- PM should initiate a pre-application inquiry with the Penhold/Red Deer County AHJ during concept design to confirm or revise this estimate. If actual timelines exceed 8 weeks, RISK-SCH-02 and RISK-PER-01 schedule impact ratings may need upward revision. (**ASSUMPTION**: 4-8 week estimate is not RFP-stated; based on general Alberta municipal permit practice.)

Environmental and wetland permits may require parallel processing. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §9, DEL-06-02; ASSUMPTION -- AHJ review timeline not stated in RFP)

### C-005 — Workshop Time Allocation Rationale

Procedure Step 1.2 assigns specific time ranges per risk category for the identification workshop. The allocations reflect the following rationale:

- **Design and Site/Environmental (30-40 min each):** These are the highest-complexity categories for this project. Design risk spans five disciplines integrating eight Addendum 03 requirements. Site/Environmental risk involves multiple overlapping constraints (flood fringe, wetland, geotechnical, environmental) requiring coordinated discussion among Civil, Structural, and PM leads.
- **Cost (20-30 min):** Cost risk discussion is focused on specific scope costing gaps and market conditions; much of the cost risk detail flows from Design and Site assessments already discussed.
- **Schedule (20-30 min):** Schedule risk is concentrated in a few key drivers (permitting timeline, long-lead procurement, discipline coordination) that can be addressed efficiently.
- **Procurement and Permitting (15-20 min each):** These categories have narrower risk surfaces at the proposal stage; procurement risk centers on specialty equipment availability, and permitting risk centers on AHJ timeline and regulatory requirements.

These allocations are guidance, not rigid constraints. The PM (facilitator) may adjust time based on discussion depth -- for example, if Site/Environmental risk discussion reveals unexpected complexity, time may be extended at the expense of lower-priority categories. (**ASSUMPTION**: Time allocations are based on estimated risk surface area per category for this project; not prescribed by any standard.)

### C-006 — Procurement Risk Is Concentrated in Specialist Equipment

Five Addendum 03 items involve specialty equipment with potentially long lead times or limited central Alberta supplier availability:
- 16 ft overhead doors (specialty commercial door suppliers)
- Backup diesel generator (electrical/mechanical specialty)
- Fire apparatus direct exhaust system (specialty ventilation)
- 2" fill stations with corrosion-resistant fittings (specialty plumbing)
- Solar-ready electrical rough-in (inverter-ready electrical provisions)

None of these are commodity items. Construction Manager should identify and pre-qualify suppliers during proposal preparation and confirm lead times before the proposal schedule is finalized. (Source: Addendum 03 §1.3–§1.16 via Decomposition v2.3 §4; SOW-0010)

## Trade-offs

### T-001 — Completeness vs. Manageability

A fully comprehensive register could contain 50+ risk entries. A proposal-context register is most effective when it covers the material risks with substance, rather than listing many low-significance items for the appearance of thoroughness.

**Approach:** Target 18–25 material risks in the proposal register (3–4 per category), supported by substantive mitigation strategies. An internal tracking register may contain additional lower-significance items. The proposal register should be legible and focused. (Source: ASSUMPTION — standard practice for Design-Build proposals)

### T-002 — Transparency vs. Proposal Positioning

Honest risk identification (P-003) requires acknowledging real uncertainties (geotechnical reliance, wetland boundary, escalation). This creates a trade-off with proposal positioning: will the evaluator read honest risk acknowledgment as a sign of weakness?

**Approach:** Frame risks with specific, capable mitigations. The evaluator for OBJ-008 is not looking for a risk-free claim; they are looking for evidence that the team has identified risks and has a plan. A register that claims no risks are material is less credible than one that identifies real risks with credible responses.

**Example framing (preferred):** "Geotechnical conditions are based on the existing 2021 report. If subsurface conditions differ from the report at the building footprint, the Structural Engineer will redesign the foundation at the 60% DD milestone using the construction confirmation testing protocol described below. Contingency reserve of [X%] addresses cost impact." (Source: OBJ-008; DEC-013)

### T-003 — Contingency Reserve Quantification

Naming a specific contingency reserve amount (e.g., "5% of construction cost") is more credible than a qualitative statement, but creates a floor that may be too low or too high given actual risk exposure.

**Approach:** Contingency reserve approach and rationale are stated in DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative). The Risk Register should reference the contingency approach without duplicating the pricing detail. The register can state "contingency reserve allocated in pricing narrative for this risk" rather than duplicating the dollar amount. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §9, DEL-01-06 description; DEC-012)

**Contingency adequacy evaluation guidance:** When the PM reviews the contingency reserve referenced in DEL-01-06, the following directional criteria should inform whether the reserve is proportionate to the risk profile identified in this register:

- **Risk category coverage:** Does the contingency address the categories with the highest residual risk (typically Site/Environmental and Cost for this project)?
- **Red-rated risk coverage:** Are the Red-rated risks (e.g., RISK-DES-01, RISK-CST-01, RISK-CST-02, RISK-SCH-02) each reflected in the contingency approach, either as a percentage allowance or a line-item provision?
- **DEC-013 exposure:** Does the contingency explicitly account for the accepted geotechnical reliance risk (RISK-SIT-04), given that no additional investigation is being conducted?
- **Market escalation buffer:** Is the escalation assumption in DEL-01-06 consistent with the RISK-CST-02 impact assessment?

These criteria are directional and do not prescribe a specific contingency percentage. The PM's judgment, informed by estimator input and market conditions, determines final adequacy. (**ASSUMPTION**: Contingency adequacy criteria are not prescribed by RFP; derived from standard Design-Build risk-cost alignment practice.)

## Examples

### EX-001 — Well-Formed Design Risk Entry

The following entry (RISK-DES-01 from the Datasheet register) demonstrates the desired level of specificity:

**Risk:** Addendum 03 program additions (16 ft doors, sumps, direct exhaust, generator, fill stations, 40 lockers, solar-ready roof) create coordination complexity across all five disciplines, increasing design iteration risk.

**Why this is well-formed:**
- Traceable to a specific source (Addendum 03 requirements list)
- Describes the mechanism (five-discipline coordination, not just "design risk")
- Mitigation is specific (coordination matrix at kickoff; lead architect chairs weekly coordination; Addendum 03 requirements distributed to responsible discipline per Decomposition v2.3 SOW-0010)
- Owner is named (Lead Architect)
- Residual risk is non-trivial (Medium-Medium) — the coordination challenge does not disappear entirely

### EX-002 — Geotech Reliance Risk (DEC-013 Compliance)

**Risk:** Geotechnical conditions may differ from the 2021 Investigation Report at the confirmed 12-acre building footprint; foundation design at proposal stage relies on this historical report only (DEC-013).

**Why this is required:**
- DEC-013 is an explicit business decision (Decomposition v2.3 §13) that creates a known, accepted risk
- Risk Acceptance is an appropriate response at proposal stage; contingency reserve covers impact
- The register must acknowledge this risk (R-006) to be transparent per OBJ-008
- Evaluators familiar with Alberta construction will recognize this as a standard geotechnical risk — a credible register acknowledges it rather than omitting it

### EX-003 — Poor Risk Statement (Avoid)

**Poor:** "There may be schedule delays."

**Why this fails:**
- Not traceable to any project-specific source
- Does not identify the mechanism (what causes the delay?)
- Mitigation ("we will manage the schedule") is not actionable
- Owner is implied but not named

**Better:** "Permitting timeline (building permit, AHJ review) may delay construction start beyond the design phase completion target. Mitigation: PM to initiate AHJ pre-application meeting at 60% DD milestone; concurrent permit review where AHJ permits; schedule assumes [X]-week AHJ review window." (Source: ASSUMPTION — AHJ review timeline not stated in RFP; based on Alberta municipal permit practice)

### EX-004 — Proposal Presentation and Packaging Guidance

The Risk Register and Narrative are produced as working documents in this deliverable folder but must ultimately be formatted for proposal submission. The Evaluation Committee (identified in Purpose as a primary audience) will assess the deliverable based on how it appears in the proposal package, not the working Markdown files. The following presentation guidance supports OBJ-008 scoring:

- **Recommended proposal placement:** The Risk Mitigation Narrative should appear as a standalone section or appendix within the proposal, not buried within another deliverable's narrative. The tabular Risk Register may be included as an appendix or embedded within the narrative depending on proposal page constraints.
- **Executive summary option:** Consider including a one-page visual risk summary (e.g., a 3x4 risk heat map showing the distribution of risk entries by Risk Level color) at the beginning of the risk section. This provides the evaluator with an immediate visual impression of the team's risk posture.
- **Register formatting:** When converting to proposal PDF, ensure the register tables are legible at print scale. If tables are too wide for single-page landscape, consider splitting into two tiers: (1) Risk ID, Description, Likelihood, Impact, Risk Level; (2) Risk ID, Mitigation Strategy, Residual Risk, Owner, Status.
- **Narrative tone check:** Before final PDF assembly, the Proposal Manager should read the narrative as if encountering it for the first time, assessing whether it reads as confident and project-grounded (per R-013).

(**ASSUMPTION**: Proposal presentation format is not prescribed by the RFP; guidance is based on standard Design-Build proposal packaging practice. Source: Guidance Purpose section; Procedure Step 6.3.)

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No conflicts identified after cross-document consistency check (Pass 2). The following table is available for future conflict entries if cross-document review of DEL-10-02, DEL-01-06, or DEL-09-01 identifies inconsistencies.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| *None identified* | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |

### Terminology Note

Per Procedure Step 5.4, the canonical term for vehicle bays is "apparatus bay" (not "fire bay"). The term "fire bay" is acceptable only in fill station context (e.g., "1 fire bay, 1 PW bay" when referencing 2" fill station locations per Addendum 03 §1.10). All four documents in this deliverable should use this convention consistently. (Source: Procedure.md Step 5.4 Terminology Consistency table.)
