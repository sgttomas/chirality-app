# Deliverable: DEL-10-01 Risk Register and Mitigation Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to systematically identify, categorize, assess, and address threats to successful project delivery across design, site/environmental, cost, schedule, procurement, and permitting dimensions. It must carry the knowledge of what can go wrong, how likely and severe each threat is, and what specific actions reduce exposure -- serving both as an internal decision-support instrument and as external evidence of mature, transparent risk governance.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**
- _CONTEXT.md -- DEL-10-01 identity, description, scope (SOW-0028), objective alignment (OBJ-008)
- _STATUS.md -- Current state: INITIALIZED (2026-02-17)
- Datasheet.md -- Risk register column schema, 26 risk entries across 6 categories, conditions, references, TBD items
- Specification.md -- 13 requirements (R-001 through R-013), verification matrix, standards
- Guidance.md -- 6 principles, 5 considerations, 3 trade-offs, examples, conflict table
- Procedure.md -- 6-step production procedure, prerequisites, verification checks, records
