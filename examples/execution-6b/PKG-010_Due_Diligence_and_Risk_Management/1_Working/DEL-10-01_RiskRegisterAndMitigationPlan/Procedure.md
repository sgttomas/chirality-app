**Responsible Party:** PM + Technical Leads
**Date Generated:** 2026-02-17

---

## Purpose

This procedure governs the production of the Risk Register and Mitigation Plan for the Penhold PSB Design-Build proposal. It covers:

- What inputs and team composition are required before starting
- How to conduct risk identification, assessment, mitigation planning, and documentation
- How to verify the completeness and cross-document consistency of the deliverable
- What records to maintain through the proposal and post-award lifecycle

---

## Prerequisites

### P-PRE-01 — RFP and Addenda Available

Ensure the following source documents are accessible before beginning risk identification:
- RFP 2024_004 (Jul 10, 2024) — Sections 2–9 (risk themes throughout)
- Addendum 01 (Jul 11, 2024), Addendum 02 (Jul 15, 2024), Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024)

Priority: Addendum 03 governs where conflict exists with base RFP. (Source: Decomposition v2.3 §2)

### P-PRE-02 — Reference Reports Available (Best-Effort)

Obtain access to the following reference reports from the PKG-010/0_References folder or Proposal Manager:
- 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D)
- Wetland Assessment and Impact Report (Appendix D)
- Desktop Environmental Assessment — Ghostpine (Appendix D)
- Site Grading Documentation (Appendix E)
- Flood Zone Mapping for parcel

If reports are not directly accessible, proceed using Decomposition v2.3 §2–4 context as the source basis. Mark all entries derived from Decomposition summary (rather than direct report access) as **source: location TBD**.

### P-PRE-03 — Decomposition v2.3 Available

Confirm access to Penhold PSB Project Decomposition v2.3 (FINAL). Required sections:
- §4 (Addendum 03 integration summary)
- §6 (Objectives — OBJ-008)
- §7 (SOW-0028 definition)
- §9 (DEL-10-01 and DEL-10-02 deliverable descriptions)
- §13 (DEC-013 — no additional geotechnical investigation)
- §3 (Hard constraints C-10, C-12)

### P-PRE-04 — Related Deliverables Available for Cross-Reference

The following deliverable contexts must be accessible for downstream consistency checks:
- DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary) — site/environmental risk inputs
- DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative and Assumptions) — cost risk and contingency alignment
- DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) — construction and schedule risk alignment
- DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule) — schedule mitigation checkpoint alignment

### P-PRE-05 — Responsible Party Team Assembled

The Risk Register is produced by PM + Technical Leads. For risk identification, the following roles must participate:

| Role | Risk Category Responsibility |
|------|------------------------------|
| PM | Facilitator; Schedule, Permitting risk co-lead |
| Lead Architect | Design risk lead |
| Structural Engineer | Site/Environmental (geotechnical), Design (structural) risk assessment |
| Civil Engineer | Site/Environmental (wetland, grading, drainage, flood fringe), Permitting risk co-lead |
| Mechanical Engineer | Design risk (apparatus exhaust, sumps, generator, fill stations) |
| Electrical Engineer | Design risk (solar roof, generator transfer switching, electrical coordination) |
| Estimator / Commercial Lead | Cost risk lead |
| Construction Manager | Schedule, Procurement risk lead |

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Risk Identification (Workshop)

**Objective:** Identify candidate risks across all six categories from RFP, Addendum 03, reference reports, and team expertise.

**1.1 Addendum 03 Requirement Review (Pre-Workshop)**

Before the workshop, PM circulates the Addendum 03 requirement checklist (derived from Decomposition v2.3 §4 and SOW-0010) to all Technical Leads. Each discipline lead reviews how the following eight items affect their design scope:

| Addendum 03 Item | Primary Discipline |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 16 ft overhead doors (all bays) | Architect |
| Bay sumps (all bays) | Structural + Mechanical |
| Fire apparatus direct exhaust (2 per bay) | Mechanical |
| Backup generator minimum loads | Mechanical + Electrical |
| 2" fill stations (1 fire, 1 PW bay) | Mechanical |
| Solar-capable roof orientation | Architect + Electrical |
| 40 bunker gear lockers + room ventilation | Architect + Mechanical |
| Room sizing ranges | Architect |

**1.2 Risk Identification Workshop (2–4 hours)**

Conduct a structured brainstorming session with PM + Technical Leads. Organize discussion by category; assign a note-taker.

| Category | Discussion Time | Prompt Questions |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Design | 30–40 min | What discipline coordination gaps exist? Which Addendum 03 requirements are most technically complex? What code compliance uncertainties remain? |
| Site/Environmental | 30–40 min | What do the reference reports imply for site layout, foundation, drainage, and access? What constraints are confirmed vs. assumed? |
| Cost | 20–30 min | Where is the estimate most sensitive to scope clarification? What market conditions pose escalation risk? What allowances may be insufficient? |
| Schedule | 20–30 min | What is the critical path from award to occupancy? Where are the bottlenecks? How long does permitting take? |
| Procurement | 15–20 min | Which equipment or materials are specialty items with long lead times or limited suppliers in Alberta? |
| Permitting | 15–20 min | What regulatory approvals are required? Who is the AHJ? What are realistic approval timelines? |

**1.3 Candidate Risk Capture**

Document all candidate risks in a working list with:
- Risk ID (provisional)
- Category
- Risk description (draft)
- Potential consequence (cost, schedule, technical)
- Source reference (RFP §, Addendum §, report type, or ASSUMPTION)

Do not filter or prioritize at this stage.

**Output:** Brainstorm list of 30–60 candidate risks.

---

### Step 2 — Risk Assessment and Prioritization

**Objective:** Rate each candidate risk for Likelihood and Impact; calculate Risk Level; assign owners.

**2.1 Likelihood Rating**

| Rating | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Low | Unlikely to occur; limited evidence suggests rare event for this project type |
| Medium | Plausible; may occur given project conditions; historical precedent exists |
| High | Likely; strong project-specific evidence (RFP, reference report, market conditions) supports high probability |

**2.2 Impact Rating**

| Rating | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Low | Minor consequence; manageable without escalation (<2% cost or <1 week schedule) |
| Medium | Moderate consequence; requires design or schedule adjustment (2–8% cost or 1–4 weeks) |
| High | Significant consequence; major rework, cost overrun >8%, or schedule slip >4 weeks |
| Critical | Project-level consequence; threat to budget, schedule, or RFP compliance |

**2.3 Risk Level Matrix (L × I)**

| | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact | Critical Impact |
|---|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **High Likelihood** | Amber | Red | Red | Red |
| **Medium Likelihood** | Green | Amber | Red | Red |
| **Low Likelihood** | Green | Green | Amber | Red |

**2.4 Owner Assignment**

Assign each risk to a responsible party (role, not individual name where possible) who will own monitoring and mitigation execution. Do not leave Owner blank for Active risks.

**2.5 Filter and Target**

Target 18–25 material risks for the proposal register (3–4 per category). Lower-significance risks (Green level, low priority) may be tracked in an internal register but are not required in the proposal document.

**Output:** Rated and prioritized risk list; Top 10–12 material risks identified for executive summary treatment in the narrative.

---

### Step 3 — Mitigation Strategy Development

**Objective:** Define specific, actionable mitigation strategies for each Active risk; document residual risk.

**3.1 Mitigation Response Type Selection**

For each Active risk, select the primary response type:

| Response Type | When to Use | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Avoid | Risk can be designed out or scope changed | Design site access to avoid wetland buffer entirely |
| Reduce | Proactive steps lower likelihood or impact | Structural peer review at 30% DD to confirm foundation approach |
| Transfer | Responsibility shifted to a subtrade or third party | Fixed-price structural steel subcontract transfers market escalation |
| Accept | Risk cannot be avoided or reduced cost-effectively | Accept geotechnical reliance risk (DEC-013); allocate contingency |

**3.2 Mitigation Strategy Format**

Each mitigation strategy shall include:
- Named action (what will be done)
- Responsible party (who does it)
- Trigger or timing (when — design milestone, procurement window, or decision point)

**3.3 Design Milestone Mapping**

Map mitigations to project milestones where applicable:

| Milestone | Mitigation Focus |
|-----------|----------------|
| Concept Design (SOW-0009/0010) | Addendum 03 coordination; generator sizing; solar orientation; sump coordination |
| 30% Detailed Design | Foundation approach review; wetland boundary confirmation; long-lead procurement identification |
| 60% Detailed Design | Generator load calculation confirmed; apparatus exhaust system confirmed; AHJ pre-application meeting |
| IFC Package (100% Detailed Design) | Building permit submission; all long-lead procurement initiated |
| Construction Mobilization | Site confirmation testing (if foundation risk triggered); AHJ inspection protocol established |

**3.4 Residual Risk Statement**

For each Active risk, document the residual risk (post-mitigation Likelihood / Impact) as a composite rating. At least three entries shall retain a non-trivial residual (Medium or above) to reflect realistic post-mitigation conditions. Do not overstate mitigation effectiveness.

**3.5 Contingency Reserve Reference**

Where an Accept response is chosen, document the contingency approach:
- If quantified contingency reserve is allocated in DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative), cross-reference: "Contingency reserve allocated in pricing narrative; see DEL-01-06."
- Do not duplicate dollar amounts from DEL-01-06 in this deliverable.

**Output:** Mitigation strategies for all Active risks; residual risk ratings; contingency cross-references.

---

### Step 4 — Register and Narrative Compilation

**Objective:** Produce the two deliverable artifacts: tabular register and mitigation narrative.

**4.1 Risk Register (Tabular)**

Compile the assessed, mitigated risk entries into a structured register table with the following columns (per Specification R-002):

Risk ID | Category | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk | Owner | Status

Organize by category in the following order: Design / Site-Environmental / Cost / Schedule / Procurement / Permitting. Within each category, order by Risk Level (Red → Amber → Green).

Include a summary row count at the end of each category section.

**4.2 Risk Mitigation Narrative (Prose)**

Write the narrative with five sections (per Specification R-009):

**(a) Purpose:** Why risk management is integral to this Design-Build proposal. Reference OBJ-008 and the specific risk surface created by the Penhold PSB site, program, and Addendum 03 requirements.

**(b) Risk Assessment Philosophy:** How risks were identified (workshop-based, RFP-grounded, reference report-informed); how likelihood and impact were rated; how owners were assigned; what response types are used.

**(c) Category Summaries:** One subsection per category (six total). For each category, provide:
- Key risk themes for this project
- References to specific register entries (use Risk IDs: RISK-DES-01, RISK-SIT-01, etc.)
- Summary of mitigation approach for the category

Example for Site/Environmental:
> "The 12-acre developable site presents a clustered set of environmental constraints. The 8-acre flood fringe limits effective layout area, requiring building and parking to fit within the confirmed 12-acre envelope (Addendum 03 §1.1). Wetland assessment buffers further constrain site access routing (RISK-SIT-02). Foundation design relies on the existing 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (DEC-013; RISK-SIT-04) — a known and accepted risk with contingency reserve allocated accordingly. The civil and structural leads will coordinate site layout to manage interdependencies between wetland constraints, geotechnical coverage areas, and flood fringe boundaries."

**(d) Mitigation Response Philosophy:** Explain the four response types (Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept) with project-specific examples from the register (one example per response type).

**(e) Contingency Approach:** State the team's philosophy on contingency reserve allocation. Cross-reference to DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative) for quantified amounts. Note which risk categories drive the largest contingency requirements (typically Cost and Site/Environmental based on this project's risk profile).

**4.3 Source Citation**

For every risk entry in the register:
- Cite the source document (RFP §, Addendum §, reference report type, or Decomposition v2.3 §)
- If source is not directly accessible, note "location TBD"
- If risk is derived from team experience or convention, label "ASSUMPTION"

**Output:** Completed Risk Register (tabular); Risk Mitigation Narrative (prose).

---

### Step 5 — Cross-Document Consistency Review

**Objective:** Confirm that risk entries are consistent with related deliverables and that no contradictions exist.

**Timing and dependency note:** Step 5 requires cross-checking against DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions), DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative), and DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule). These deliverables may not be draft-complete when the risk register is first compiled. The following timing guidance applies:

- **If cross-reference deliverables are draft-complete:** Perform Step 5 in full as described below.
- **If cross-reference deliverables are not yet available:** Complete Steps 1-4 and Step 6 (excluding R-012 verification). Mark Step 5 consistency checks as "PENDING -- awaiting [DEL-XX-XX] draft" in the QA checklist. Return to Step 5 when the dependent deliverables reach at least draft status.
- **Recommended sequencing:** DEL-10-02 should be drafted before or concurrently with DEL-10-01 (shared site data). DEL-01-06 and DEL-09-01 may be drafted later; their consistency checks can be deferred to the pre-submission QA window.
- **Minimum completion requirement:** All Step 5 checks must be completed before Step 6.3 (Approval and Lock). No proposal lock without completed consistency review.

**5.1 Site Risk Consistency (vs. DEL-10-02)**

Cross-check all Site/Environmental risk entries (RISK-SIT-*) against DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary). Confirm:
- Flood fringe area (8 acres) is consistent across both documents
- Geotechnical reliance statement (DEC-013) is stated identically in both
- Wetland constraint characterization does not contradict DEL-10-02 findings
- Environmental assessment findings are not described more or less severely in this register vs. DEL-10-02

If inconsistencies are found: correct the entry in this register if DEL-10-02 has more direct source access; record in Guidance.md Conflict Table if resolution requires human ruling.

**5.2 Cost Risk Consistency (vs. DEL-01-06)**

Cross-check all Cost risk entries (RISK-CST-*) against DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative). Confirm:
- Contingency reserve approach referenced in RISK-CST-01/02 is consistent with DEL-01-06 statements
- CCIP insurance approach (DEC-011) referenced in RISK-CST-03 matches DEL-01-03/DEL-01-06 insurance treatment
- Bond cost risk (RISK-CST-04) is consistent with DEL-01-03 bonding approach
- Site servicing cash allowance (RISK-CST-05) is consistent with DEL-01-06 cash allowance treatment (Addendum 03 §1.7)

**5.3 Schedule Risk Consistency (vs. DEL-09-01)**

Cross-check all Schedule risk entries (RISK-SCH-*) against DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule). Confirm:
- Permitting lead time assumption in RISK-SCH-02 is consistent with schedule milestone for building permit
- Long-lead procurement item risk in RISK-SCH-04 is reflected in schedule buffer at appropriate milestone
- Owner's schedule flexibility noted in decomposition ("not schedule-driven") is acknowledged in schedule assumptions

**5.4 Terminology Consistency**

Verify that the following terms are used identically across all four documents in this deliverable and in related deliverables:

| Term | Canonical Form |
|------|---------------|
| Public Services Building | Main Building / PSB |
| Cold Storage | "Cold Storage" (60'×100' unheated) |
| Apparatus bay | "apparatus bay" (not "fire bay") — except for fill station context |
| Addendum 03 | Capitalized; Jul 31, 2024 |
| DEC-013 | "no additional geotechnical investigation" |
| CCIP | Contractor Controlled Insurance Program |
| FF&E | $20K cash allowance, Additional Option 6 |

**5.5 Conflict Documentation**

If any inconsistency cannot be resolved from accessible sources, record it in Guidance.md Conflict Table with:
- Conflict ID
- Conflict statement
- Source A and Source B with file + section references
- Impacted sections
- Proposed authority
- Human Ruling: TBD

**Output:** Consistency review complete; any conflicts documented in Guidance.md Conflict Table.

---

### Step 6 — Quality Assurance and Final Review

**Objective:** Final check before the deliverable is incorporated into the proposal submission package.

**6.1 Completeness Check (per Specification Requirements)**

| Check | Criterion | Pass |
|-------|-----------|------|
| R-001 | 6 categories present; >= 2 entries each | Yes/No |
| R-002 | All Active entries have all 10 columns populated | Yes/No |
| R-003 | All entries traceable to source or labeled ASSUMPTION | Yes/No |
| R-004 | Addendum 03 checklist cross-referenced | Yes/No |
| R-005 | At least one entry per reference report type | Yes/No |
| R-006 | DEC-013 risk (RISK-SIT-04 or equivalent) present with Accept response | Yes/No |
| R-007 | All Active entries have specific mitigation strategies | Yes/No |
| R-008 | At least 3 entries with non-trivial residual risk | Yes/No |
| R-009 | Narrative contains 5 required elements | Yes/No |
| R-010 | No blank Owner fields in Active entries | Yes/No |
| R-011 | Long-lead procurement risk entry present | Yes/No |
| R-012 | Site risk entries consistent with DEL-10-02 | Yes/No |

**6.2 Credibility Review (PM + Proposal Manager)**

- Are risk descriptions specific to this project or generic?
- Are mitigations named and actionable or vague?
- Is the tone confident and professional (not defensive or boastful)?
- Does the register demonstrate that the team understands the Penhold PSB site, program, and proposal risks?

**6.2a Narrative Tone Consistency Check**

Review the six category summaries in the Risk Mitigation Narrative (R-009 element c) for consistent depth and tone across all categories. Verify that:
- Each category summary references at least one specific Risk ID from the register
- Category summaries are comparable in length and detail (no single category significantly shorter or more superficial than others)
- The narrative does not shift between formal and informal tone across categories
- Mitigation descriptions maintain consistent specificity (e.g., if the Site/Environmental summary names specific design milestones for mitigation, the Cost and Schedule summaries should demonstrate comparable specificity)

If unevenness is identified, revise the weaker category summaries to match the depth and specificity of the strongest ones before proceeding to Step 6.3.

**6.3 Approval and Lock**

PM signs off on the register and narrative. Proposal Manager confirms proposal positioning alignment. Lock final versions for proposal PDF assembly.

**Output:** QA checklist completed; final versions of Risk Register and Narrative locked for proposal.

## Records

### Proposal Phase Records

| Record | Format | Location | Custody |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| Risk Identification Workshop Notes | Meeting notes with candidate risk list | DEL-10-01 folder or project archive | PM |
| Working Risk Register (iterations) | Markdown or spreadsheet | DEL-10-01 folder | PM |
| Final Risk Register (locked) | Markdown or PDF | DEL-10-01 folder | PM |
| Final Risk Mitigation Narrative (locked) | Markdown or PDF | DEL-10-01 folder | PM |
| QA Checklist (Step 6.1 completed) | Checklist with sign-off | DEL-10-01 folder | PM |

### Post-Award Records (if selected)

- **Risk Register (living document):** Update monthly during design and construction; track status changes (Active → Mitigated → Closed)
- **Risk Event Log:** Document risk events that materialize, actual cost/schedule impact, and comparison to predicted impact
- **Lessons Learned:** Post-occupancy review of register accuracy; archive for future projects

### Post-Award Register Update Protocol

The proposal-stage register (26+ entries across six categories) becomes a living document upon contract award. The following protocol governs post-award maintenance:

- **Update frequency:** Monthly during design phase; bi-weekly during construction phase (or at each design milestone, whichever is more frequent).
- **Update facilitator:** PM facilitates a 30-60 minute risk register review session with relevant Technical Leads.
- **Estimated effort per update cycle:** 2-4 hours total (including preparation, review session, and register update documentation) for a register of this size. This estimate should be validated after the first two update cycles and adjusted if actual effort differs materially.
- **Update triggers (outside regular cycle):** Any of the following events should trigger an ad-hoc register review: (a) receipt of a reference report previously marked "location TBD"; (b) change order or scope modification; (c) risk event materialization; (d) AHJ permitting decision; (e) significant market price change affecting cost entries.
- **Re-entry from proposal lock:** After Step 6.3 proposal lock, the register is frozen for submission. Post-award, the PM re-opens the register by updating the status header and conducting a full review against contract award conditions (which may differ from proposal assumptions).

(**ASSUMPTION**: Post-award update protocol is not prescribed by the RFP; derived from standard Design-Build project risk management practice.)

---

## Notes

- **Order of authority:** Addendum 03 governs over base RFP where conflict exists (Decomposition v2.3 §2). Ensure risk entries that reference base RFP requirements are checked against addenda for any clarifications.
- **DEC-013 is final at proposal stage:** No re-opening of the geotechnical investigation question is permitted for the proposal submission. RISK-SIT-04 must be present and Risk Response must be Accept.
- **Pickled Sand Storage Building excluded:** C-10 / Addendum 03 §1.2 removes this building from scope. No risk entries needed for this building.
- **FF&E:** $20K cash allowance per DEC-012 / Additional Option 6. Ensure RISK-CST-01 or equivalent does not inadvertently include FF&E as a cost underestimate risk — FF&E is out of base cost per Addendum 03 and is handled as a defined allowance.
- **CCIP insurance:** DEC-011 confirms CCIP approach; RISK-CST-03 addresses imprecise cost quantification at proposal stage, not the choice of approach (which is resolved).
