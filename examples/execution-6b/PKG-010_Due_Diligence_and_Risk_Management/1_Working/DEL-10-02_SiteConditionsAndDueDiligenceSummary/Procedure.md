# Procedure — DEL-10-02: Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-10-02
**Package:** PKG-010 — Due Diligence & Risk Management

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes the **production workflow** for the Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary narrative. It guides the PM and Technical Leads through: verifying reference document access, extracting findings from each study, synthesizing those findings into a sourced narrative, and verifying cross-document consistency before proposal submission.

**Interpretation:** This procedure covers how to **produce** DEL-10-02. It is not instructions for using or operating the site — it is a document production procedure for the PM + Technical Lead team.

### Related Deliverables (for cross-document consistency)

| Deliverable | Relationship | Status Needed |
|---|---|---|
| DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept) | Site layout must be consistent with wetland setback and flood fringe constraints from this deliverable | Draft required for Step 5 cross-check. **Fallback if unavailable:** defer the DEL-02-02 cross-check items to Step 7 open items record; record as "cross-check pending — DEL-02-02 draft not yet available"; schedule follow-up when draft becomes available. Do not skip the cross-check silently. |
| DEL-02-03 (Structural Concept) | Foundation system must be consistent with geotechnical findings from this deliverable | Draft required for Step 5 cross-check. **Fallback if unavailable:** defer to Step 7 open items record; record as "cross-check pending — DEL-02-03 draft not yet available." |
| DEL-10-01 (Risk Register) | Site risk items must reference specific findings from this deliverable | Draft required for Step 5 cross-check. **Fallback if unavailable:** defer to Step 7 open items record; record as "cross-check pending — DEL-10-01 draft not yet available." |
| DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative) | Pricing assumptions for foundation and grading reference site conditions from this deliverable | Draft preferred for Step 5 cross-check. **Fallback if unavailable:** proceed without; note in Step 7 open items record. |

(Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing D-001 — resolved performance judgment requires fallback actions when prerequisite drafts are unavailable, ensuring cross-checks are not silently skipped)

### Author Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **PM (Lead Author)** | Document structure, synthesis, completeness, survey approach section, overall narrative quality |

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Verify Reference Document Access and Completeness

**Objective:** Confirm each Owner-provided reference document is accessible, readable, and covers the required content.

**Actions:**

1.1. Locate and open each Appendix D reference document (geotechnical, wetland, environmental). Verify:
- [ ] 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report — readable; key sections (soil classification, bearing capacity, water table, frost depth, recommendations) identifiable
- [ ] Wetland Assessment — readable; wetland boundary map present; setback and constraints stated
- [ ] Desktop Environmental Assessment (Ghostpine) — readable; assessment scope clear; findings and recommendations present

1.2. Locate and open Appendix E (site grading) and Appendix F (site plan/subdivision plan). Verify:
- [ ] Site Grading Plan — contours readable; drainage direction identifiable; elevation data present
- [ ] Site Plan/Subdivision Plan — parcel boundary clear; access points and legal lots identifiable

1.3. Locate flood zone mapping (source TBD — may be in Appendix F, municipal mapping, or referenced separately). Verify:
- [ ] Flood fringe boundary is clearly delineated; 8-acre area is identifiable

1.4. For any document that is missing, inaccessible, or incomplete:
- Record the gap
- Mark corresponding requirements (R-001 through R-007) as `TBD — pending reference access` in the narrative draft
- Do not infer content; flag for human follow-up

**Completion criteria:** All accessible documents confirmed; any gaps explicitly documented.

### Step 2 — Extract Geotechnical Findings

**Objective:** Summarize 2021 geotechnical report findings with citations, and connect them to foundation/slab design implications.

**Extraction targets:**

| Finding Category | Extract | Record Cite |
|---|---|---|
| Soil classification | Soil type, depth, stratification | Report Section TBD, page TBD |
| Bearing capacity | Allowable bearing (shallow footings vs. deeper); units (kPa or t/sf) | Report Section TBD |
| Seasonal water table | Estimated high and low water table depths | Report Section TBD |
| Frost depth | Design frost penetration depth for Penhold, Alberta | Report Section TBD |
| Foundation recommendations | Report's specific foundation type recommendation; any special conditions | Report Section TBD |
| Report scope and coverage | Number of boreholes; location of test pits; date of investigation; coverage of 12-acre site | Report executive summary |
| Soil corrosivity and durability data | Soil corrosivity, pH, sulphate content (if reported) — needed for DEL-05-02 downstream (see Datasheet Soil Corrosivity table) | Report lab results section (if available) |

**DEC-013 statement (mandatory):**
Include in this section or in a dedicated paragraph: "The proposal is based solely on the existing 2021 report. No additional geotechnical investigation is planned at the proposal stage and no pricing allowance has been included for supplementary investigation (DEC-013)."

**Cross-check:** Does the foundation system in DEL-02-03 match the report's recommendation? If not, document the discrepancy and resolve (or add to Conflict Table).

**Completion criteria:** All six finding categories populated with citations or explicitly marked TBD; DEC-013 statement drafted; DEL-02-03 consistency checked.

---

### Step 3 — Extract Environmental and Constraint Findings

**Objective:** Summarize wetland, environmental, site grading, and flood zone findings with citations.

**Wetland Assessment (R-004):**

| Extract Target | Notes |
|---|---|
| Wetland boundary location | Direction from building area; proximity to 12-acre functional site |
| Wetland area and classification | Riparian, shallow marsh, or other; ecological value |
| Applicable construction setback | Distance in metres; regulatory basis |
| Construction constraints | Machinery restrictions; fill/dewatering prohibitions; staging implications |
| Permitting requirement | Provincial/municipal approval needed? Who is responsible? |
| **ASMP-02 verification** | Confirm whether the wetland boundary encroaches on the 12-acre buildable (functional) area identified in Addendum 03. Extract the wetland boundary from the Wetland Assessment map and overlay against the site plan (Appendix F) to verify ASMP-02: "Wetland boundary does not preclude the 12-acre buildable area." If the wetland boundary does encroach on the 12-acre area, escalate to PM immediately — this invalidates a foundational site assumption and may require redesign of the site layout (DEL-02-02). Record the verification result (confirmed / invalidated / inconclusive) in the ASSUMPTION Log. (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing X-001 — essential enactment foundation for ASMP-02) |

**Environmental Assessment (R-005):**

| Extract Target | Notes |
|---|---|
| Assessment type and scope | Phase 1 ESA (desktop) vs. other; methods used |
| Phase 1 findings summary | RECs identified or not; sources of potential concern |
| Groundwater context | Depth, quality indicators, contamination risk level |
| Phase 2 recommendation | Required? Optional? Proponent position if required |
| "Ghostpine" clarification | Confirm whether this is the consultant firm name, site name, or study component identifier |

**Site Grading (R-007):**

| Extract Target | Notes |
|---|---|
| Existing topography | Elevation range across site; slope direction; datum used |
| Drainage pattern | Natural drainage flow direction; low points; any seasonal wet areas |
| Access points | Existing and proposed access from Waskasoo Avenue North |
| Grading implications | Fill / cut requirements to achieve building platform; drainage design context |

**Flood Zone (R-006):**

| Extract Target | Notes |
|---|---|
| Flood fringe boundary | Confirmed 8-acre area; boundary demarcation vs. site plan |
| Flood designation type | Flood fringe (development permitted with conditions) vs. floodway (restricted); confirm |
| Storm pond location | Confirm location in flood fringe zone per Addendum 03 site scheme |
| Compensatory storage requirement | If applicable to storm pond construction in fringe area |

**Completion criteria:** All four constraint categories (wetland, environmental, grading, flood) populated with citations or explicitly marked TBD.

### Step 4 — Develop Survey Approach Statement

**Objective:** Draft the survey approach and assumptions section per SOW-0026.

**Actions:**

4.1. Draft the survey approach paragraph covering:
- Concept design is based on Owner-provided Appendices D-F (site plan, grading documentation, subdivision plan)
- Detailed legal/topographic survey files will be provided by the Owner after contract award (per Addendum 03)
- Post-award, the proponent will conduct site reconnaissance and refine the concept design using the received survey data
- Final certified legal survey will be completed by [responsible party — ASSUMPTION: proponent's licensed Alberta Land Surveyor subconsultant] and provided at project completion, prior to substantial performance (per RFP §7.4)

4.2. State explicitly what is assumed in the absence of pre-award survey detail:
- [ ] Site topography is as shown in Appendix E
- [ ] Parcel boundaries are as shown in Appendix F
- [ ] Utility locations are TBD — to be confirmed from post-award survey and Alberta One-Call records
- [ ] Any discrepancy between Appendix data and actual survey will be addressed in design development (normal Design-Build process)

**Completion criteria:** Survey section drafted with explicit timing statement (post-award files), design basis statement (Appendices D-F), and final certified survey commitment.

---

### Step 5 — Synthesize Narrative and Cross-Document Consistency Check

**Objective:** Assemble the complete narrative and verify it is consistent with related deliverables.

**5a. Narrative Assembly**

Draft the full narrative following the structure defined in Datasheet §Construction:
1. Purpose and Scope
2. Geotechnical Findings and Foundation Implications
3. Wetland Assessment Constraints
4. Environmental Assessment Findings
5. Flood Zone Context
6. Site Grading Conditions
7. Survey Approach and Assumptions
8. Design and Cost Implications (synthesis)
9. References

For each section, ensure:
- Every non-trivial finding is cited (source document + section/page reference where possible)
- All inferences are labeled **ASSUMPTION**
- Missing data is marked `TBD` (never guessed)

**5b. Cross-Document Consistency Checks**

| Check | What to Verify | Action if Discrepancy |
|---|---|---|
| Datasheet ↔ Specification | All site conditions in Datasheet Conditions table map to at least one requirement in Specification | Add requirement or update Datasheet |
| Specification ↔ Guidance | Requirements R-001 through R-012 have corresponding rationale in Guidance Principles or Considerations | Add Guidance entry |
| Specification ↔ Procedure | Requirements R-001 through R-012 have verification steps in Procedure | Update Steps or Verification table |
| Terminology consistency | Canonical terms per Guidance Vocabulary Notes: "flood fringe" (not "flood zone" or "flood area"); "2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report" (formal) or "2021 geotechnical report" (subsequent references); "Desktop Environmental Assessment" (not "Ghostpine" pending CONF-10-02-003 resolution) | Update terminology to match Vocabulary Notes |
| DEL-02-02 consistency | Civil site concept building placement is in 12-acre functional site, not flood fringe; drainage approach consistent with site grading findings | Reconcile; add to Conflict Table if unresolved |
| DEL-02-03 consistency | Foundation system in structural concept is consistent with geotechnical report recommendations | Reconcile; add to Conflict Table if unresolved |
| DEL-10-01 consistency | Top site risks in risk register reference specific findings from this summary (geotechnical variability, wetland permitting, flood storage, survey gap) | Reconcile with risk register author |
| Values consistency | "20 acres total / 12 acres functional / 8 acres flood fringe" is stated consistently across all four documents | Correct any inconsistency |

If any inconsistency cannot be resolved from available sources, add it to the Conflict Table in Guidance.md.

**Completion criteria:** Narrative complete; all four cross-document checks passed or conflicts captured in Conflict Table; no unexplained terminology or value inconsistencies.

---

### Step 6 — Technical Lead Review and Sign-Off

**Objective:** Confirm technical accuracy before finalizing narrative for proposal inclusion.

| Reviewer | Sections to Review | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **Structural / Geotechnical Lead** | Geotechnical Findings; Foundation and Grading Implications | Confirms soil data, bearing capacity, water table, frost depth, and foundation system are accurately represented from 2021 report; DEC-013 position is correctly stated |
| **Civil Engineer** | Site Grading Conditions; Flood Zone Context; Survey Approach | Confirms grading data accurate; 8-acre/12-acre split correctly represented; drainage implications are consistent with DEL-02-02; survey assumptions are appropriate |
| **Environmental Lead (if available)** | Wetland Assessment Constraints; Environmental Assessment Findings | Confirms wetland boundary, setback, constraints are accurately represented; Phase 1 assessment scope and findings are correctly described; Phase 2 position is clearly stated |
| **PM** | Full narrative; all cross-document consistency checks | Confirms R-001 through R-012 all addressed (including R-012 dedicated synthesis section); DEC-013 clearly stated; no TBD items remain unacknowledged; formal acceptance per Specification Documentation table sign-off criteria; document ready for proposal assembly |

Actions after review:
- Incorporate reviewer comments
- Update any TBD items where access has been obtained
- Document any remaining unresolved TBDs as items for human resolution

---

### Step 7 — Post-Submission Record and Open Items Capture

**Objective:** Capture which TBD items and assumptions remained open at submission time, ensuring post-award teams know what needs verification.

**Actions:**

7.1. Compile a summary of all TBD items that persisted into the submitted narrative:
- For each TBD, record: the item, which requirement it affects (R-001 through R-012), the source document needed to resolve it, and the responsible party for post-award resolution.

7.2. Compile a summary of all ASSUMPTIONs that remained unverified at submission:
- For each assumption (ASMP-01 through ASMP-05), record: whether it was confirmed, remains assumed, or was invalidated during the production process.

7.3. Record any Conflict Table items (CONF-10-02-001 through CONF-10-02-004) that were deferred with "TBD" human ruling, noting the proposed authority and any interim approach adopted in the narrative.

7.4. Store the open items record as part of the project memory for handoff to the post-award design team.

**Completion criteria:** All open TBDs, unverified assumptions, and deferred conflicts are documented in a single record accessible to post-award teams.
