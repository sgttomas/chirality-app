# Guidance — DEL-10-02: Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-10-02
**Package:** PKG-010 — Due Diligence & Risk Management

---

## Purpose

### Why This Deliverable Exists

The RFP requires the Design-Build proponent to demonstrate transparent, informed understanding of site conditions before design and cost commitments are finalized. This is not a generic compliance checkbox — it is an active demonstration, scored under OBJ-008, that the proponent has reviewed every Owner-provided reference study, understands the site constraints, and has incorporated those constraints into the design concept and pricing.

Without this deliverable, the proposal risks:
- Presenting design assumptions that contradict site conditions (credibility loss)
- Omitting site constraints from the risk register (risk transparency failure)
- Leaving evaluators uncertain whether geotechnical and environmental conditions have been priced appropriately

### Strategic Value

**OBJ-008 — Manage risk and unknowns transparently:** A well-sourced, structured due diligence summary shows the Owner that the proponent has done the work. The explicit DEC-013 decision ("no additional geotechnical investigation; existing 2021 report is the basis") is a risk acceptance decision that must be stated clearly and defended — not hidden.

### Downstream Use

| Consumer | How This Deliverable Is Used |
|---|---|
| DEL-10-01 (Risk Register) | Site risk items (geotechnical, wetland, environmental, flood) should trace back to specific findings in DEL-10-02 |
| DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept) | Building placement and drainage strategy are constrained by wetland setback and flood fringe demarcation summarized here |
| DEL-02-03 (Structural Concept) | Foundation system selection references geotechnical findings summarized here |
| DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability) | Durability strategy for foundations and slabs addresses soil corrosivity, frost depth, and water table conditions documented here |
| DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative) | Pricing assumptions for foundation, grading, and drainage reference site conditions established here |
| Owner evaluation committee | Assesses proponent's professional understanding of site realities prior to award |
| Post-award design team | Uses this as baseline reference for site reconnaissance and detailed design |

## Principles

### P-001: Source Fidelity First

Every material finding cited in the narrative must come from an Owner-provided reference document (2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report, Wetland Assessment and Impact Report, Desktop Environmental Assessment, Appendix E grading, Appendix F site plan, flood mapping). See Vocabulary Notes for canonical terminology. If a source document has not been fully reviewed, the finding must be marked `TBD` rather than inferred. Distinguish clearly between "the report states X" (cited) and "we assume X because the report does not clarify" (ASSUMPTION label).

**Source:** AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS §SPEC (Sources cited; TBD for unknowns)

### P-002: Own the DEC-013 Decision Confidently

The decision not to conduct additional geotechnical investigation (DEC-013) is a deliberate risk acceptance, not an oversight. The narrative should state this explicitly and explain why the existing 2021 report is considered adequate for proposal-stage design. Do not hedge or obscure this decision. Evaluators will assess whether the proponent understands the risk it is accepting.

**Source:** Decomposition §12 (OI-004 closed by DEC-013); Decomposition §13 (Decision Log)

### P-003: Link Every Finding to a Design or Cost Implication

Each site condition described in the narrative should be followed by a statement of design response or cost implication. The narrative is not a literature review — it demonstrates that site findings have been integrated into the proposal. Example pattern: "The 2021 geotechnical report indicates [finding] → the concept design proposes [response] → cost implication is [X]."

**Source:** SOW-0027 (decomposition scope ledger: "show implications for design concept and pricing assumptions"); OBJ-008

### P-004: Transparent Scope Boundaries for Each Study

State clearly what each reference study covers and what it does not. A desktop environmental assessment is not a Phase 2 soil sampling investigation. A 2021 geotechnical report may not cover the full 12-acre site uniformly. These boundaries help evaluators understand what risks have been priced and what remains contingent.

**Source:** OBJ-008; professional due diligence practice

### P-005: State Survey Assumptions Explicitly

Since detailed survey files are not available until after contract award (Addendum 03), the proposal design is necessarily based on Owner-provided Appendices D-F. This is a known and acceptable condition — but it must be stated explicitly. The proposal should name the specific files it used and commit to refining the design upon receipt of post-award survey data.

**Source:** RFP §7.4; Addendum 03; SOW-0026

### P-006: Maintain Consistency with Design Deliverables

Site constraint statements in DEL-10-02 must be consistent with design assumptions in DEL-02-02 and DEL-02-03. If the civil site concept places the main building in a location that appears to conflict with the wetland setback described here, that is a cross-document inconsistency that must be resolved before submission. Use the Conflict Table for unresolved issues.

## Considerations

### C-001: Geotechnical Findings — Key Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Soil classification** | Summarize soil type and depth profile. Silty clay is common in central Alberta; if the report identifies this, note implications for bearing capacity and drainage. |
| **Bearing capacity** | State the report's recommended bearing capacity for shallow foundations; link to the structural concept's foundation system choice (DEL-02-03). |
| **Seasonal water table** | If water table is at or near slab depth seasonally, explain how slab-on-grade design accommodates this (drainage layer, perimeter drainage, waterproofing). This is also relevant to bay sump design (mandatory per Addendum 03). |
| **Frost depth** | Alberta climate requires frost protection to approximately 1.5–2.0 m depth (ASSUMPTION — specific value from report, location TBD). Foundation design must address frost heave. |
| **Report scope limitations** | State how many boreholes the report includes, where they were located, and whether they cover the full 12-acre buildable area. If the report is limited in coverage, this is a noted uncertainty. |
| **DEC-013 rationale** | The proposal must explain why the existing report is sufficient: proposal-stage design does not require the precision of detailed design; detailed geotechnical engineering will be completed post-award with the same report as reference, supplemented by post-award site reconnaissance if needed. |

### C-002: Wetland Assessment — Key Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Boundary and area** | State where the wetland is located (direction from building area; proximity). Note whether it falls within the 8-acre flood fringe zone or encroaches on the 12-acre buildable area. ASSUMPTION: it falls within or adjacent to the flood fringe; specific extent TBD from Appendix D. |
| **Setback requirement** | Provincial regulations typically require a 30–100 m buffer from wetland edges depending on classification. **Note:** The 30–100 m range is too wide to support a compliance determination for the civil site layout (DEL-02-02). The specific applicable setback for this wetland classification is **TBD — must be extracted from the Wetland Assessment report (Appendix D)** upon access. Until the specific value is known, DEL-02-02 should design conservatively to the upper end of the range or flag this as a constraint pending resolution. Show that the civil site layout (DEL-02-02) respects the confirmed setback once determined. (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing A-002 — compliance determination requires a specific value, not a range) |
| **Construction constraints** | Machinery may be excluded from buffer zones during construction. Address this in construction methodology cross-reference (DEL-07-01). |
| **Permitting implications** | Provincial environmental approval may be needed if construction activities affect the wetland area. State whether the proponent assumes this is the Owner's responsibility or is included in the proponent's scope. |

### C-003: Environmental Assessment — Key Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Assessment type** | "Desktop Environmental Assessment" typically refers to a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (records review, aerial analysis, limited reconnaissance). State what type of assessment was done. |
| **Phase 1 findings** | Phase 1 may identify Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs). If no RECs are present, state this clearly. If RECs are identified, explain why they do not create liability for this project or what mitigation is included. |
| **Phase 2 need** | If the Phase 1 recommends Phase 2 soil/groundwater sampling, state the proponent's position: will Phase 2 be conducted? At whose cost? When? If not included, explain why and add to the risk register (DEL-10-01). |
| **Groundwater** | Note depth and condition. If groundwater is shallow, this is relevant to foundation drainage, slab design, and construction dewatering. |

### C-004: Flood Zone — Key Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Flood fringe definition** | In Alberta, "flood fringe" is the area between the regulatory flood level and the 1-in-100-year floodplain edge. It is not the floodway (where flood flows are conveyed). Development is typically permitted in the fringe with compensatory storage or protection. Confirm which designation applies to the 8-acre area. |
| **Building placement** | The main PSB, fire apparatus bays, and public works operations must be outside the flood fringe. The 12-acre functional site should be confirmed as outside the fringe. Storm pond and dog park can occupy the fringe zone. |
| **Compensatory storage** | If any grading of the flood fringe area is required (e.g., storm pond construction), provincial requirements may mandate compensatory flood storage. Confirm whether this is addressed in the civil design (DEL-02-02). |
| **Flood-proofing cost** | Main building outside flood fringe does not require flood-proofing; this is a cost saving vs. sites fully within a flood zone. State this explicitly. |

### C-005: Survey Approach — Key Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Design basis** | The concept design is based on Owner-provided Appendices D-F (site plan, grading plan, subdivision plan). State this clearly. |
| **Post-award refinement** | Upon award, the Owner provides detailed survey files. The proponent will conduct site reconnaissance and refine the design accordingly. This is a normal and expected part of the design-build process. |
| **Final certified survey timing** | RFP §7.4 requires a final certified survey at project completion. This is typically provided by a licensed Alberta Land Surveyor. State who is responsible (proponent or subconsultant) and when it will be completed relative to substantial performance. |
| **Survey file format (TBD)** | The nature of post-award survey files is not specified. ASSUMPTION: files include a topographic survey and legal survey in standard AutoCAD/PDF format. Confirm upon award. |

## Trade-offs

### T-001: No Additional Geotechnical Investigation vs. Foundation Design Risk

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Option A (chosen):** | Foundation design based on existing 2021 geotechnical report; no additional investigation; no pricing allowance |
| **Option B (not chosen):** | Commission supplementary geotechnical investigation; delay proposal; include investigation cost in pricing |
| **Rationale for A:** | DEC-013 explicitly closes OI-004 with Option A. Proposal-stage design can proceed on the 2021 report basis. Detailed geotechnical engineering will occur in the design development phase post-award, using the same report supplemented by any post-award reconnaissance. |
| **Risk accepted:** | Site soil conditions may vary across the 12-acre site beyond what the 2021 report captured. If significant variation is found post-award, foundation design may require adjustment — a design risk that has been consciously accepted. |
| **Source:** | DEC-013; Decomposition §12 (OI-004 closed) |

### T-002: Flood Fringe as Constraint vs. Site Utilization Asset

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Constraint:** | 8 acres in flood fringe reduces usable development area to 12 acres; principal buildings must be placed outside fringe |
| **Asset:** | Storm pond and dog park uses can occupy the flood fringe, making productive use of otherwise restricted land; no costly flood-proofing needed for the main building |
| **Design response:** | Civil concept (DEL-02-02) should explicitly show building footprint in 12-acre functional site and storm pond/dog park in flood fringe area, with clear boundary demarcation |
| **Source:** | Addendum 03; Decomposition §1 and DEL-10-02 description |

### T-003: Desktop Environmental Assessment (Phase 1) vs. Phase 2 Investigation

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Current basis:** | Desktop environmental assessment (Phase 1) — records review and limited reconnaissance; Ghostpine reference (Appendix D) |
| **If Phase 2 not needed:** | Cost savings; no additional schedule impact; typical for undeveloped/agricultural land |
| **If Phase 2 is needed (per Phase 1 recommendation):** | Significant cost and schedule impact; must be addressed in risk register (DEL-10-01); cost implication in DEL-01-06 |
| **ASSUMPTION:** | Phase 1 found no RECs requiring Phase 2 (typical for this type of site); specific findings TBD from Appendix D |
| **Escalation if assumption is wrong:** | If upon actual access to the Desktop Environmental Assessment (Appendix D), Phase 1 findings reveal Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs): (1) escalate immediately to PM for risk register update (DEL-10-01), (2) assess cost implications for DEL-01-06 (pricing narrative), (3) determine whether Phase 2 investigation is required and at whose cost (Owner vs. proponent), (4) if Phase 2 is required, assess schedule impact on proposal timeline, (5) document the finding and decision in the Conflict Table for human ruling if scope/cost responsibility is unclear. See also ASMP-04 escalation path in Datasheet. (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing C-002 — defensible merit basis requires a documented fallback) |
| **Source:** | RFP Appendix D; SOW-0027 |

### T-004: Post-Award Survey Files vs. Design Certainty at Proposal Stage

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Limitation:** | Detailed legal and topographic survey files not available at proposal stage |
| **Mitigation:** | Owner-provided Appendices D-F (site plan, grading plan, subdivision plan) provide adequate context for concept design |
| **Post-award path:** | Survey files provided after award enable design refinement before detailed design submission milestones |
| **Risk:** | Minor design adjustments may be needed once actual survey detail is received; this is a normal and accepted risk in Design-Build procurement |
| **Source:** | Addendum 03; RFP §7.4; SOW-0026 |

## Examples

### EX-001: Linking Geotechnical Finding to Foundation Design

**Pattern (for narrative writing):**

*"The 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D, [Section TBD]) identifies [soil type] with an allowable bearing capacity of [X t/sf] for shallow foundations at [Y m] depth. The water table is estimated at [Z m] below grade seasonally. Based on these findings, the proposed structural concept (DEL-02-03) utilizes [slab-on-grade with shallow spread footings / other system]. Apparatus bay floor slabs incorporate integrated sumps as required by Addendum 03, designed to accommodate the seasonal water table condition. Foundation depth is set at [Y+margin] m to ensure frost protection per Alberta climate requirements."*

Note: Values marked TBD above are to be populated from the 2021 report upon access.

### EX-002: Stating the DEC-013 Position

**Pattern (for narrative writing):**

*"The proposal is based on the existing 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report provided in RFP Appendix D. No additional geotechnical investigation has been conducted at the proposal stage, and no pricing allowance has been included for supplementary investigation. This decision was made deliberately: the 2021 report is sufficiently detailed for proposal-stage concept design. Detailed geotechnical engineering will be completed during the design development phase following award, working from the same report supplemented by post-award site reconnaissance. Should site variability beyond the report's coverage be identified during design development, the Risk Register (DEL-10-01) addresses this contingency."*

### EX-003: Flood Fringe — Building Placement Statement

**Pattern (for narrative writing):**

*"The site plan (Appendix F) and flood zone mapping identify approximately 8 acres of the 20-acre parcel as lying within the flood fringe designation. This area corresponds to the proposed storm pond and dog park locations in the southwest portion of the site. The functional developable site — the 12-acre area in which the main Public Services Building, Fire Apparatus Bays, and Public Works Operations are located — is situated outside the flood fringe designation. No flood-proofing of principal building structures is required. The storm pond design accommodates provincial flood storage requirements for the fringe area (civil design developed under DEL-02-02)."*

## Vocabulary Notes (Canonical Terminology)

The following canonical terms shall be used consistently across all four documents (Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure). Authors and reviewers should normalize to these terms during narrative production and cross-document consistency checks (Procedure Step 5b).

| Canonical Term | Acceptable Variants (avoid in final narrative) | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report** | "geotech report," "2021 geotechnical report," "geotechnical report" | Use the full formal name on first reference in each document section; "2021 geotechnical report" is acceptable for subsequent references within the same section. Avoid informal abbreviations ("geotech") in the final proposal narrative. | Decomposition §3 (reference document list); Semantic Lensing F-002 |
| **Desktop Environmental Assessment** | "Desktop Environmental Assessment (Ghostpine)," "Ghostpine environmental assessment" | Use "Desktop Environmental Assessment" as the interim canonical label until CONF-10-02-003 is resolved. The "Ghostpine" parenthetical should be omitted from the canonical name pending confirmation of whether it refers to the consulting firm, site name, or study identifier. Once resolved, update all four documents consistently. | Decomposition §3; Semantic Lensing B-004; CONF-10-02-003 |
| **Wetland Assessment and Impact Report** | "wetland assessment," "wetland report" | Use the full formal name on first reference. | RFP Appendix D reference list |
| **flood fringe** | "flood zone," "flood area," "floodplain" | "Flood fringe" is the specific Alberta regulatory term for the area between the regulatory flood level and the 1-in-100-year floodplain edge. Use consistently; do not substitute with the more general "flood zone." | Alberta Water Act terminology; Guidance C-004 |

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-10-02-001 | Flood fringe boundary specifics: "8 acres in flood fringe" is established in decomposition and Addendum 03, but whether the wetland assessment boundary overlaps with or is distinct from the flood fringe boundary is unclear without accessing Appendix D and F. May affect site layout coordination. | Addendum 03 (8-acre flood fringe); Decomposition | RFP Appendix D (wetland boundary); Appendix F (site plan) | Conditions (Datasheet); R-004/R-006 (Specification); C-002/C-004 (Guidance) | Resolve by cross-referencing wetland boundary map (Appendix D) against site plan (Appendix F) upon access to PDFs | TBD |
| CONF-10-02-002 | Survey file scope: Addendum 03 states survey files will be provided post-award, but it is unclear whether "survey files" refers only to topographic survey, or includes legal survey, utility survey, or other documentation. The proposal needs to state what it is assuming. | Addendum 03 (survey files after award) | RFP §7.4 (final certified survey at completion) | R-008 (Specification); C-005 (Guidance); Step 4 (Procedure) | Addendum 03 governs; clarify scope of survey files in proposal as ASSUMPTION pending post-award confirmation | TBD — proponent should state assumption explicitly in narrative |
| CONF-10-02-003 | Environmental assessment title: The decomposition refers to "Desktop Environmental Assessment — Ghostpine" (Appendix D). It is unclear whether "Ghostpine" is the consulting firm name, the site name, or a study component identifier. This affects how the assessment is cited. | Decomposition §3 (reference document list) | RFP Appendix D (actual document) | R-005 (Specification); EX-001 pattern (Guidance) | Verify correct name/firm/scope from Appendix D upon access; cite accurately in narrative | TBD |
| CONF-10-02-004 | Wetland permitting responsibility: Guidance C-002 states "Provincial environmental approval may be needed if construction activities affect the wetland area" and asks whether this is the Owner's responsibility or the proponent's. This is an open governance question that affects both scope and cost but is not assigned to a resolution path. Must be decided before proposal submission to ensure the pricing narrative (DEL-01-06) and construction methodology (DEL-07-01) correctly reflect responsibility. | Guidance C-002 (permitting implications) | No contradicting source — this is an unresolved scope question | R-004 (Specification); C-002 (Guidance); DEL-01-06 (pricing scope); DEL-07-01 (construction methodology scope) | Human must rule: (a) Owner responsibility (excluded from proponent scope), (b) proponent responsibility (included in pricing), or (c) conditional (proponent scope only if wetland is affected by construction). PROPOSAL: state as ASSUMPTION in narrative that wetland permitting is Owner's responsibility unless proponent's construction activities directly disturb the wetland buffer zone. | TBD (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing E-001 — exhaustive governance breadth) |
