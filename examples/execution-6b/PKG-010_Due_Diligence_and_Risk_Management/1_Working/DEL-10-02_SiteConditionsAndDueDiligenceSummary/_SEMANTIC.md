- k=guiding: "Resolved Value Direction" * "Foundational Directive Authority" = "directed foundational worth"
- k=applying: "Justified Merit Enactment" * "Essential Enactment Foundation" = "essential merit foundation"
- k=judging: "Definitive Value Appraisal" * "Binding Foundational Verdict" = "conclusive worth verdict"
- k=reviewing: "Assured Quality Consistency" * "Essential Assurance Verification" = "essential quality assurance"

L_E = {directed foundational worth, essential merit foundation, conclusive worth verdict, essential quality assurance}

**I(evaluative, necessity, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * necessity = "essential value"

Step 2:
- essential value * directed foundational worth = "intrinsic worth foundation"
- essential value * essential merit foundation = "core merit basis"
- essential value * conclusive worth verdict = "definitive value finding"
- essential value * essential quality assurance = "fundamental quality guarantee"

Step 3: Centroid of {intrinsic worth foundation, core merit basis, definitive value finding, fundamental quality guarantee} → **"Foundational Value Assurance"**

#### E(evaluative, sufficiency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=guiding: "Resolved Value Direction" * "Substantiated Guidance Basis" = "grounded value counsel"
- k=applying: "Justified Merit Enactment" * "Defensible Execution Capacity" = "justified merit capacity"
- k=judging: "Definitive Value Appraisal" * "Substantiated Adjudication Basis" = "grounded appraisal ruling"
- k=reviewing: "Assured Quality Consistency" * "Substantiated Assurance Basis" = "grounded quality assurance"

L_E = {grounded value counsel, justified merit capacity, grounded appraisal ruling, grounded quality assurance}

**I(evaluative, sufficiency, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * sufficiency = "adequate value"

Step 2:
- adequate value * grounded value counsel = "substantiated worth guidance"
- adequate value * justified merit capacity = "warranted merit capacity"
- adequate value * grounded appraisal ruling = "defensible value judgment"
- adequate value * grounded quality assurance = "sufficient quality ground"

Step 3: Centroid of {substantiated worth guidance, warranted merit capacity, defensible value judgment, sufficient quality ground} → **"Warranted Value Substantiation"**

#### E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=guiding: "Resolved Value Direction" * "Comprehensive Guidance Scope" = "full value guidance range"
- k=applying: "Justified Merit Enactment" * "Exhaustive Implementation Scope" = "total merit implementation"
- k=judging: "Definitive Value Appraisal" * "Comprehensive Adjudication Scope" = "thorough appraisal breadth"
- k=reviewing: "Assured Quality Consistency" * "Exhaustive Assurance Scope" = "total quality coverage"

L_E = {full value guidance range, total merit implementation, thorough appraisal breadth, total quality coverage}

**I(evaluative, completeness, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = "total value"

Step 2:
- total value * full value guidance range = "comprehensive worth scope"
- total value * total merit implementation = "exhaustive merit breadth"
- total value * thorough appraisal breadth = "complete appraisal range"
- total value * total quality coverage = "integral quality extent"

Step 3: Centroid of {comprehensive worth scope, exhaustive merit breadth, complete appraisal range, integral quality extent} → **"Comprehensive Value Breadth"**

#### E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=guiding: "Resolved Value Direction" * "Principled Guidance Alignment" = "principled value alignment"
- k=applying: "Justified Merit Enactment" * "Coherent Execution Discipline" = "coherent merit discipline"
- k=judging: "Definitive Value Appraisal" * "Principled Adjudication Coherence" = "principled appraisal coherence"
- k=reviewing: "Assured Quality Consistency" * "Disciplined Assurance Alignment" = "disciplined quality alignment"

L_E = {principled value alignment, coherent merit discipline, principled appraisal coherence, disciplined quality alignment}

**I(evaluative, consistency, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = "uniform value"

Step 2:
- uniform value * principled value alignment = "principled worth consistency"
- uniform value * coherent merit discipline = "disciplined merit coherence"
- uniform value * principled appraisal coherence = "coherent appraisal principle"
- uniform value * disciplined quality alignment = "uniform quality discipline"

Step 3: Centroid of {principled worth consistency, disciplined merit coherence, coherent appraisal principle, uniform quality discipline} → **"Principled Value Discipline"**
