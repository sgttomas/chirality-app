# Specification — DEL-10-02: Site Conditions and Due Diligence Summary

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-10-02
**Package:** PKG-010 — Due Diligence & Risk Management

---

## Scope

### What This Deliverable Covers

DEL-10-02 produces a **site conditions and due diligence summary narrative** that consolidates Owner-provided reference studies into a sourced, proposal-stage document demonstrating proponent understanding of site constraints and their design/cost implications. It addresses:

1. Geotechnical investigation findings (2021 report, Appendix D) and implications for foundation design and site grading (SOW-0027)
2. Wetland assessment constraints and construction implications (Appendix D; SOW-0027)
3. Desktop environmental assessment findings and construction approach context (Appendix D; SOW-0027)
4. Flood zone context: 8-acre flood fringe; 12-acre developable functional site (SOW-0027)
5. Existing site grading status and conditions (Appendix E; SOW-0027)
6. Survey approach and assumptions — survey files provided post-award, final certified survey at completion (RFP §7.4; Addendum 03; SOW-0026)

## Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Source | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-001 | The narrative shall summarize findings from the 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D), including at minimum: soil classification, bearing capacity, seasonal water table depth, frost depth, and geotechnical recommendations for foundation type. The summary shall also note the report's spatial coverage (borehole count and locations relative to the proposed building footprint). | RFP §2.3; Appendix D; SOW-0027; Guidance C-001 (report scope limitations) | Reviewer confirms each of the five finding categories is present with citation to 2021 report. Reviewer also confirms that the narrative assesses whether borehole locations cover the proposed building area, or marks this as a noted uncertainty. (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing C-001 — spatial coverage verification gap) |
| R-002 | The narrative shall explicitly state that no additional geotechnical investigation is planned and no pricing allowance has been included for supplementary investigation, and shall attribute this to Decision DEC-013. | DEC-013; SOW-0027 scope ledger notes | Reviewer confirms explicit "no additional investigation / no pricing allowance" language appears in narrative |
| R-003 | The narrative shall explain the geotechnical implications for the proposed foundation system and slab design (including bay sumps required per Addendum 03). | RFP §2.3; Appendix D; Addendum 03; SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms foundation implications section links geotech findings to structural concept (DEL-02-03) |
| R-004 | The narrative shall summarize the wetland assessment (Appendix D), identifying: wetland location/boundary, applicable construction setback distance, and construction constraints. | RFP Appendix D; SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms wetland section present with boundary, setback, and constraint statements |
| R-005 | The narrative shall summarize the desktop environmental assessment findings (Appendix D — Ghostpine), identifying: assessment scope, Phase 1 findings, groundwater context, and any Phase 2 recommendations. | RFP Appendix D; SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms environmental section present addressing scope, findings, and Phase 2 status |
| R-006 | The narrative shall describe the flood zone context, explicitly stating that 8 acres of the 20-acre parcel are in flood fringe (for storm pond and dog park), and that the functional developable site is 12 acres. | Addendum 03; Decomposition §1 and DEL-10-02 description; SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms 8-acre / 12-acre split is explicitly stated |
| R-007 | The narrative shall describe existing site grading conditions from Appendix E and explain their implications for the proposed design concept (site elevation, drainage direction, grading cost assumptions). | RFP Appendix E; SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms site grading section references Appendix E and addresses design implications |
| R-008 | The narrative shall address the legal/topographic survey approach, stating that detailed survey files will be provided by the Owner after contract award, and that the concept design is based on Owner-provided Appendices D-F pending survey detail. | RFP §7.4; Addendum 03; SOW-0026 | Reviewer confirms survey approach section explicitly states post-award timing and design assumptions |
| R-009 | The narrative shall confirm the obligation to provide a final certified survey at project completion. | RFP §7.4; SOW-0026 | Reviewer confirms final survey commitment is explicitly stated |
| R-010 | The narrative shall synthesize how each reference study finding influences design choices or cost assumptions, demonstrating that site conditions have been integrated into the proposal rather than deferred. Each of the following major finding categories must have at least one corresponding design or cost implication statement: (a) bearing capacity and foundation type, (b) seasonal water table and drainage, (c) wetland setback and site layout, (d) flood fringe and building placement, (e) site grading cut/fill. | OBJ-008; RFP §2.3; SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms that each of the five enumerated finding-implication categories (a-e) has at least one explicit design or cost implication statement in the narrative. (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing F-001 — mandatory compliance threshold for "major findings" now defined) |
| R-012 | The narrative shall include a dedicated "Design and Cost Implications" synthesis section that integrates findings from all reference studies into a consolidated statement of how site conditions collectively shape design choices and pricing assumptions. This section shall not merely repeat section-level implication statements but shall provide an integrated view of how geotechnical, wetland, environmental, flood, and grading findings interact. | OBJ-008; Datasheet Narrative Structure table ("Design and Cost Implications" section); SOW-0027 | Reviewer confirms a distinct synthesis section exists that addresses cross-cutting implications rather than repeating individual section findings. (Enrichment source: Semantic Lensing F-003 — comprehensive value accounting for synthesis section) |
| R-011 | Design implications stated in this narrative shall be consistent with site constraint treatment in DEL-02-02 (civil site concept) and DEL-02-03 (structural concept). | DEL-02-02; DEL-02-03 | Cross-document consistency check confirms no contradictions between site findings here and design assumptions in DEL-02-02/DEL-02-03. Specific acceptance criteria: (a) building footprint placement must align with 12-acre functional site boundary, (b) foundation type selection must be consistent with 2021 geotechnical report recommendations, (c) bearing capacity values must match, (d) wetland setback distance must not conflict with site layout. A discrepancy requiring resolution is any case where a quantitative value or design choice in DEL-02-02/DEL-02-03 contradicts or ignores a finding stated in this narrative. Acceptable variation is any case where DEL-02-02/DEL-02-03 adds detail beyond what this narrative states without contradicting it.

**Note on professional standards:** This deliverable is a proposal-stage narrative summarizing Owner-provided studies. It is not itself a professional engineering report. Standards such as NBCC, Alberta Building Code, and provincial environmental regulations are relevant to the underlying reference studies and to subsequent detailed design, but are not normatively imposed on this narrative document directly.
