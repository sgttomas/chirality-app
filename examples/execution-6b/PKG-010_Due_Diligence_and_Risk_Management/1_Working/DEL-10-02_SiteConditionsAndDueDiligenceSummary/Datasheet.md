### Reference Studies (Owner-Provided)

| Study | Location | Contents | Accessibility | Blocking Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report** | RFP Appendix D | Soil classification, bearing capacity, water table, frost depth, foundation recommendations | PDF — specific findings TBD (not accessed per context management instructions) | **BLOCKING** — Required before narrative sections on geotechnical findings and foundation implications can be drafted (R-001, R-002, R-003) |
| **Wetland Assessment and Impact Report** | RFP Appendix D | Wetland boundary, ecological value, construction constraints, setback requirements | PDF — specific findings TBD | **BLOCKING** — Required before wetland constraints section can be drafted (R-004); setback value needed for DEL-02-02 coordination |
| **Desktop Environmental Assessment** | RFP Appendix D | Phase 1 environmental screening; groundwater; contamination risk. Note: Decomposition §3 references this as "Ghostpine" — whether this is the consulting firm, site name, or study identifier is TBD pending access (see CONF-10-02-003). | PDF — specific findings TBD | **BLOCKING** — Required before environmental findings section can be drafted (R-005) |
| **Site Grading Documentation** | RFP Appendix E | Existing topography; drainage patterns; site elevations | PDF — specific findings TBD | Refinement — can be populated during Step 2-3 of Procedure; not blocking initial narrative structure |
| **Site Plan / Subdivision Plan** | RFP Appendix F | Parcel boundaries; legal lot layout; adjacent subdivision | PDF — specific findings TBD | Refinement — provides context for site layout but narrative can be structured without it |
| **Flood Zone Mapping** | RFP reference (source TBD — may reside in Appendix D, Appendix F, or municipal mapping; see Procedure Step 1.3 for locating) | Flood fringe boundary demarcation | PDF — specific findings TBD | **BLOCKING** — Required for precise 8-acre flood fringe boundary demarcation (R-006); source document must be located first |

### Soil Corrosivity and Durability-Related Site Conditions

These conditions are relevant to DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability) per the Guidance Downstream Use table. Values are TBD pending access to the 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D).

| Condition | Value | Source | Downstream Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Soil corrosivity** | TBD — extract from geotechnical report if available | RFP Appendix D (2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report) | DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability — foundation and slab durability strategy) |
| **Soil pH / sulphate content** | TBD — extract if reported | RFP Appendix D | DEL-05-02 (concrete mix design considerations) |

**Source for this enrichment:** Semantic Lensing E-002 (comprehensive value breadth lens). **Rationale:** Guidance Downstream Use table states DEL-05-02 consumes "soil corrosivity, frost depth, and water table conditions" from DEL-10-02, but no other document previously included soil corrosivity as an extraction target. Added here as TBD to ensure the downstream value chain is complete. ASSUMPTION: the 2021 geotechnical report may contain soil corrosivity data; if it does not, this should be noted as a data gap.

### Geotechnical Report Coverage Metadata

This table captures the 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report's coverage parameters, needed to assess whether the report adequately covers the proposed building footprint (per Guidance C-001 report scope limitations consideration). Values are TBD pending access to Appendix D.

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Report date** | 2021 (specific date TBD) | RFP Appendix D — report cover page |
| **Number of boreholes** | TBD | RFP Appendix D — report methodology section |
| **Borehole locations** | TBD — to be mapped against proposed building footprint | RFP Appendix D — report figure(s) |
| **Spatial coverage of 12-acre buildable area** | TBD — assess whether boreholes adequately cover the proposed building area | RFP Appendix D; Guidance C-001 |
| **Investigation depth** | TBD | RFP Appendix D — borehole logs |

**Source for this enrichment:** Semantic Lensing B-003 (comprehensive record lens); Guidance C-001 (report scope limitations). **Rationale:** Guidance C-001 identifies "report scope limitations" as a key consideration, but the Datasheet previously had no structured field to capture this metadata.

### Key Decisions Affecting This Deliverable

| Decision | Substance | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **DEC-013** | No additional geotechnical investigation at this time. Foundation design and site assessment will rely on existing 2021 geotechnical report only. No pricing allowance for future investigation. | Decomposition §12 (OI-004 closed); Decomposition §13 |
| **Addendum 03 — Survey timing** | Survey files provided to award winner after contract execution; final certified survey required at project completion | Addendum 03; SOW-0026 |
| **Addendum 03 — Developable area** | 12-acre functional site; 8 acres in flood fringe for storm pond and dog park | Addendum 03; Decomposition §1 |
| **Addendum 03 — Pickled sand removal** | Pickled sand storage building removed from this RFP; separate future RFP | Addendum 03; Decomposition §1 |

### ASSUMPTION Log

| ID | Assumption | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ASMP-01 | Geotechnical bearing capacity from 2021 report is adequate for proposed building footprint without supplementary investigation | DEC-013 explicitly accepts this risk; report was conducted for this site |
| ASMP-02 | Wetland boundary does not preclude the 12-acre buildable area identified in Addendum 03 | Owner confirmed 12 acres developable; wetland presumably falls within or adjacent to flood fringe zone |
| ASMP-03 | 8-acre flood fringe area accommodates storm pond and dog park uses without principal building construction | Addendum 03 site scheme implies this allocation; no contradicting evidence |
| ASMP-04 | Phase 1 desktop environmental assessment found no recognized environmental conditions (RECs) requiring Phase 2 investigation | Typical for agricultural/undeveloped land; specific findings TBD from report. **Escalation path if wrong:** If Phase 1 findings upon actual access reveal RECs, escalate to PM for risk register update (DEL-10-01), cost implication assessment (DEL-01-06), and determination of whether Phase 2 is required and at whose cost. See Guidance T-003 for trade-off analysis. (Source: Semantic Lensing C-002) |
| ASMP-05 | Final certified survey will be achievable prior to substantial performance | Standard practice per RFP §7.4; no reason to assume otherwise |
