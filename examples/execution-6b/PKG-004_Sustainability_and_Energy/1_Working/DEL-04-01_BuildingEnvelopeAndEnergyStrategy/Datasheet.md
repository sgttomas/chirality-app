## Conditions

| Condition | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Envelope thermal performance targets (walls, roof, glazing) | TBD | Specific R-values and U-values to be established in Design Development; narrative targets defined in Specification |
| Air barrier system location and continuity | TBD | Location (inner or outer), material, and continuity strategy to be defined in Design Development |
| Vapor management strategy | TBD | Vapor drive direction, retarder/barrier placement, permeability class, and condensation risk approach to be defined per R-ENV-003A |
| Thermal bridging mitigation | TBD | Key junction strategies to be designed in detail; narrative commitment documented in this deliverable |
| Energy code compliance pathway selection | TBD | Prescriptive vs. performance path determination per NECB; decision to be confirmed during Design Development |
| Building energy performance targets (quantified) | TBD | kWh/m²/year or % above/below NECB baseline; to be quantified if performance modeling selected |
| Solar-ready roof provisions | Required (per Addendum 03) | Roof orientation: flat, south, west, or southwest per Addendum 03 s1.x; structural loading and mechanical/electrical rough-in required |
| Cold Storage zone envelope | TBD | Unheated; extreme temperature differentials; freeze-thaw envelope detailing critical |
| Coordination with DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy) | Pending | Envelope-mechanical interaction: HVAC sizing, HRV assumptions, infiltration baseline |
| Coordination with DEL-04-03 (Electrical Energy) | Pending | Solar-ready electrical provisions, LED lighting internal heat gain assumptions |

## Construction

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Artifact Format** | Narrative document section (component of proposal Design Brief, PKG-004 submission) |
| **Anticipated Content** | Energy philosophy statement; climate adaptation strategy; thermal performance targets by assembly; air barrier approach; thermal bridging mitigation; energy code compliance pathway; MEP integration; solar-ready provisions per Addendum 03 |
| **Document Integration** | This deliverable is one of three PKG-004 documents (DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, DEL-04-03) that collectively form the Sustainability & Energy section of the proposal; also feeds into the Design Brief (PKG-003) narrative for evaluation scoring |
| **Sister Deliverables** | DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy and Solar Readiness); DEL-04-03 (Electrical Energy Efficiency) |
| **Downstream Uses** | Informs DEL-05-01 (Architectural Durability) on material selection; informs DEL-04-02/03 on envelope-mechanical/electrical load baseline |
