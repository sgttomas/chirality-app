# Deliverable: DEL-04-01 Building Envelope and Energy Strategy

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** DEL-04-01 exists to articulate a coherent building envelope energy strategy -- thermal performance targets, air barrier continuity, thermal bridging mitigation, and energy code compliance pathway -- for a cold-climate public services building with a 50-year design life. The deliverable must coordinate envelope assumptions with parallel mechanical and electrical narratives, satisfy solar-ready provisions, and produce a credible proposal-stage narrative that demonstrates integrated energy thinking to non-specialist evaluators.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

- p4 = adequate merit * accredited quality review = "certified value"

Step 3: Centroid of {approved worth, proven esteem, warranted quality, certified value} --> u = "Certified Merit"

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- t1 = "Purposive Merit Direction" * "Exhaustive Governance Scope" = "total value governance"
- t2 = "Realized Worth" * "Complete Fulfillment" = "full value realization"
- t3 = "Conclusive Worth Ruling" * "Exhaustive Adjudication" = "total worth judgment"
- t4 = "Settled Merit Review" * "Exhaustive Inspection Scope" = "comprehensive merit audit"

L = {total value governance, full value realization, total worth judgment, comprehensive merit audit}

**I(evaluative, completeness, L):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = "total valuation"

Step 2:
- p1 = total valuation * total value governance = "absolute worth authority"
- p2 = total valuation * full value realization = "exhaustive fulfillment"
- p3 = total valuation * total worth judgment = "comprehensive merit ruling"
- p4 = total valuation * comprehensive merit audit = "complete quality accounting"

Step 3: Centroid of {absolute worth authority, exhaustive fulfillment, comprehensive merit ruling, complete quality accounting} --> u = "Exhaustive Merit Accounting"

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- t1 = "Purposive Merit Direction" * "Principled Governance" = "value-principled authority"
- t2 = "Realized Worth" * "Reliable Conduct" = "dependable value practice"
- t3 = "Conclusive Worth Ruling" * "Dependable Adjudication" = "consistent worth ruling"
- t4 = "Settled Merit Review" * "Principled Oversight" = "ethical merit governance"

L = {value-principled authority, dependable value practice, consistent worth ruling, ethical merit governance}

**I(evaluative, consistency, L):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = "coherent worth"

Step 2:
- p1 = coherent worth * value-principled authority = "integrity-driven governance"
- p2 = coherent worth * dependable value practice = "reliable merit conduct"
- p3 = coherent worth * consistent worth ruling = "stable value adjudication"
- p4 = coherent worth * ethical merit governance = "principled quality regime"

Step 3: Centroid of {integrity-driven governance, reliable merit conduct, stable value adjudication, principled quality regime} --> u = "Principled Value Regime"
