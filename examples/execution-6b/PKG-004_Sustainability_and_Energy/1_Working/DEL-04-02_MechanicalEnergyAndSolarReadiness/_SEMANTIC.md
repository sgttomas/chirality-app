# Deliverable: DEL-04-02 Mechanical Energy and Solar Readiness

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to articulate the mechanical engineering rationale for energy-efficient building systems and solar-readiness provisions within a combined emergency services and public works facility, demonstrating how zone-specific mechanical strategies, heat recovery opportunities, and future-oriented solar rough-in provisions collectively address the facility's unique operational energy profile. The perspective is that of a discipline narrative that must convey credible technical reasoning about energy performance to a mixed evaluator audience, bridging prescriptive code compliance with operational energy intelligence.
