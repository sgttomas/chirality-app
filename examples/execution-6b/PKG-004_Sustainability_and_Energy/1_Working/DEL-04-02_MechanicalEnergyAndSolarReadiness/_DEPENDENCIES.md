## Run Notes

**Run Date:** 2026-02-17
**Mode:** UPDATE (initial run -- no prior Dependencies.csv)
**Strictness:** CONSERVATIVE
**Consumer Context:** NONE

### Defaults and Paths Used

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RUN_ROOT | /Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/chirality-app-test/test/execution-6b/ | Provided by invoker |
| DECOMPOSITION_PATH | _Decomposition/Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_v2.md (v2.3 FINAL) | Located under _Decomposition/ folder |
| SOURCE_DOCS | AUTO: Datasheet.md, Specification.md, Guidance.md, Procedure.md | Scanned deliverable folder; excluded _DEPENDENCIES.md, _REFERENCES.md, _CONTEXT.md, _SEMANTIC.md, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md, _STATUS.md |
| ANCHOR_DOC | Datasheet.md | Highest-confidence match: contains Identification table with Scope Item Coverage and Objective Alignment |
| EXECUTION_DOC_ORDER | Specification.md, Guidance.md, Procedure.md | Ordered by workflow clarity: Specification (requirements/scope), Guidance (principles/considerations), Procedure (prerequisites/steps) |
| _REFERENCES.md | Read; used to confirm cross-references to DEL-02-04, DEL-04-01, DEL-04-03 | Present in deliverable folder |

### Extraction Notes

- **Pass 1 (ANCHOR):** Extracted 1 IMPLEMENTS_NODE anchor (SOW-0012) and 1 TRACES_TO_REQUIREMENT anchor (OBJ-004). Both confirmed against Decomposition sections 6, 9, and 10.
- **Pass 2 (EXECUTION):** Extracted 10 execution edges (7 UPSTREAM DELIVERABLE, 3 UPSTREAM DOCUMENT, 1 DOWNSTREAM DELIVERABLE).
- All deliverable targets resolved against Decomposition section 9 definitions.
- Document targets (Addendum 03, OSR, Functional Program) resolved against Procedure.md prerequisites and _REFERENCES.md. Addendum 03 path confirmed in _Sources/ folder. OSR and Functional Program locations are TBD (referenced but full text accessibility not confirmed).
- DEL-02-01 and DEL-02-02 are listed as separate INTERFACE edges because the source documents explicitly name both as providing orientation data (architectural floor plan orientation vs. site plan orientation).
- DEL-02-07 is not referenced in the UPSTREAM direction. Guidance.md C-002 and Procedure.md Step 2 Coordination B mention DEL-02-02 instead.
- DEL-04-03 is typed as INTERFACE (bidirectional coordination on solar provisions) rather than PREREQUISITE because the sources describe concurrent coordination, not a strict input gate.

### Warnings

- None. All quality checks passed.
