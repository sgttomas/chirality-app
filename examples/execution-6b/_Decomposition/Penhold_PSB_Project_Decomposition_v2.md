## 12. Open Issues (OI)

| OI ID | Issue | Resolution | DecisionRef | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OI-001** | Decide whether to submit "Intent to Propose" (Appendix C) -- requested but not required | **Not applicable.** Intent to Propose will not be submitted; no compliance impact. Removed dependency from SOW-0002. | DEC-010 | **CLOSED** |

## 13. Decision Log (DEC)

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **DEC-001** | v1: Used 9-package structure. v2: Restructured to 10-package structure per user direction | v2 merges compliance/commercial/team into one package; expands design into discipline-level packages for clearer production ownership |
| **DEC-002** | Construction methodology (PKG-007) retains 5 deliverables (methodology, administration, subconsultants, meetings, QA/QC) | Sections 7.2 and 7.3 cover distinct topics; splitting improves parallel production and review |
| **DEC-003** | v1: Sustainability/energy and durability/maintenance were deliverables within PKG-004. v2: Each is now its own package (PKG-004, PKG-005) with discipline-level deliverables | These are separately evaluated (durability = 15 pts, design brief includes sustainability); separate packages with discipline-level deliverables align production responsibility to the consultant who actually does the work |
| **DEC-004** | SOW-0029 (quality management), SOW-0030 (pricing assumptions), SOW-0031 (value alternatives), SOW-0032 (warranty) remain as explicit scope items | These are distinct RFP requirements that could be overlooked if bundled; making them atomic improves coverage tracking |
| **DEC-005** | Deficiencies management (DEL-08-02) remains separate from commissioning/closeout (DEL-08-01) | Section 7.3.7 has detailed, distinct requirements including monetary valuation and holdback |
| **DEC-006** | Conceptual Design (PKG-002) split into 5 discipline deliverables: Architectural drawings (DEL-02-01), Civil/Site plan (DEL-02-02), Structural narrative (DEL-02-03), Mechanical narrative (DEL-02-04), Electrical/IT narrative (DEL-02-05) | Architect produces drawings; each engineering discipline produces its concept narrative showing how the concept addresses their scope. This matches how design teams actually divide labor: architect leads concept with discipline support narratives |
| **DEC-007** | Design Brief (PKG-003) split into 6 deliverables: one per RFP-required discipline sub-brief (arch, civil, structural, mech, elec/IT) plus a cross-cutting accessibility/adaptability narrative | RFP Section 7.1.2 explicitly names 5 discipline sub-briefs; each is authored by the responsible discipline lead. Accessibility (7.1.3) and adaptability (7.1.5) are cross-cutting concerns best coordinated by the architect |
| **DEC-008** | Sustainability & Energy (PKG-004) split into 3 deliverables: building envelope/energy (arch/building science), mechanical energy + solar (mech), electrical energy + lighting (elec) | Each discipline has distinct sustainability contributions; splitting aligns to production responsibility and avoids one party bottlenecking the others |
| **DEC-009** | Building Durability & Maintenance (PKG-005) split into 4 deliverables: architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical | Durability is 15 evaluation points; each discipline must contribute credible content about their systems' longevity and maintainability. Separate deliverables ensure no discipline is overlooked |
| **DEC-010** | Intent to Propose (Appendix C) will not be submitted | Not applicable to this proposal; no compliance impact from omission; Appendix C is requested but not required (OI-001 closed) |
| **DEC-011** | Insurance approach confirmed as CCIP (Contractor Controlled Insurance Program) | Contractor arranges and carries project insurance per Appendix J requirements; CCIP costs included in proposal pricing; resolves pre-ratification insurance question (OI-003 closed) |
| **DEC-012** | FF&E priced as $20,000 cash allowance (Additional Option 6) on Schedule A line 1-7 and Schedule B Additional Item 6 | Keeps FF&E out of base cost per Addendum 03 while providing a defined allowance amount for evaluation; simple cash allowance avoids scope ambiguity (OI-002 closed) |
| **DEC-013** | No additional geotechnical investigation; foundation design based on existing 2021 geotechnical report only; no pricing allowance for future investigation | Existing report is deemed sufficient for proposal-stage design; risk accepted; no budget impact from additional investigation (OI-004 closed) |
