# Coordination Record

**Project:** Town of Penhold -- Public Services Building Design-Build Proposal (RFP 2024_004)
**Decomposition:** Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_v2.md (v2.3 FINAL, 2026-02-17)
**Execution Root:** `/Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/chirality-app-test/test/execution-6b/`

**Representation:** Declared critical dependencies
**Dependency tracking mode:** DECLARED
**External schedule / coordination artifact:** N/A
**Default maturity threshold (if computing blockers):** INITIALIZED

## Dependency Rules

- Only interface-critical dependencies are recorded in-file; humans manage the rest.
- Dependency register format: `_DEPENDENCIES.md` per deliverable (will switch to `Dependencies.csv` if DEPENDENCIES extraction pipeline is run).
- Blocker computation: a dependency is "met" when the upstream deliverable reaches INITIALIZED or higher.
- Humans curate dependencies directly; ORCHESTRATOR does not auto-propose candidates.
