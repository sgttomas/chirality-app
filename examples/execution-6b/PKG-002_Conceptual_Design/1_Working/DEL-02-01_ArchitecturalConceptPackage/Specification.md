## Scope

### What is Included

The Architectural Concept Package (DEL-02-01) produces the foundational architectural drawings that demonstrate a functional, code-compliant building arrangement on the 12-acre developable site, incorporating all Addendum 03 program clarifications and special requirements. The package is part of PKG-002 (Conceptual Design) and directly supports OBJ-003 (Proposed Conceptual Design: 20 pts, the highest-weighted single technical criterion).

**Deliverable outputs:**
1. **Architectural floor plan(s):** All programmed rooms with area callouts, adjacency logic, sump locations, circulation paths, accessibility path, structural column grid overlay, and equipment callouts per Functional Program (Appendix B)
2. **Building elevations (all four cardinal directions):** Architectural character, fenestration, 16 ft overhead door height explicitly dimensioned, roof solar orientation annotated, material indication
3. **Building sections (minimum 2–4):** Key zone sections through fire apparatus bay (16 ft door height profile), mixed-use/second-storey zone, and mechanical/utility zone as required
4. **Dimensioned building envelope:** Overall L × W on floor plan; height to roof eave/peak on elevations; zone area callouts by functional zone
5. **3D rendering or massing diagram:** Optional but recommended for scoring impact; if pursued, 2–4 perspectives showing building on site context
6. **Site context plan:** Building footprint on 12-acre site (coordinated with DEL-02-02, Civil Site Concept)

## Requirements

### Mandatory Programmatic Requirements (Addendum 03 + RFP)

Requirements are derived from RFP §7.1.1, Addendum 03 (governs per Decomposition §2), and Functional Program (Appendix B). Where Addendum 03 provides specific values, those govern. Where Appendix B provides additional detail not overridden by addenda, those values apply.

> **Tolerance note (Lensing C-002):** The ±10% tolerance referenced in the Verification section for Addendum 03 room sizing is a **concept-phase planning tolerance only**. It applies to the concept floor plan sf callouts to account for schematic-level dimensioning imprecision. At detailed design, room areas must comply with exact Addendum 03 ranges without tolerance relaxation. If a room exceeds the upper range by more than 10% at concept phase, the design team must document the reason and confirm the room will be brought into range at detailed design. (Source: Addendum 03 §1.16; Addendum 01.)
