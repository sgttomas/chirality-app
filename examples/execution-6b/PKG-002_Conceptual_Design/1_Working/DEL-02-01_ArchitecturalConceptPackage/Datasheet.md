## Conditions & Requirements

### Fire and PW Apparatus Bay Count

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Fire Apparatus Bay Count** | TBD — extract from Appendix A (OSR) and/or Appendix B (Functional Program) | ASSUMPTION: Appendix A/B specifies fleet composition and bay count; Addendum 03 §1.16 provides per-bay sizing but not total count |
| **Public Works Workshop Bay Count** | TBD — extract from Appendix A (OSR) and/or Appendix B (Functional Program) | ASSUMPTION: Appendix A/B specifies PW vehicle fleet and bay requirements |

> **Note (Lensing item B-001):** The number of apparatus bays is the single largest driver of building footprint and structural clear-span scope. Addendum 03 provides per-bay sizing (2,000-2,200 sf) but the total bay count must come from Appendix A (OSR) or Appendix B (Functional Program). This datum must be extracted before floor plan layout can be finalized. (Source: Addendum 03 §1.16; Appendix A/B -- location TBD.)

### Architectural Program Compliance (Addendum 03 Room Sizing Ranges)

All sizes are **minimum-to-maximum ranges** from Addendum 03. At concept phase, areas within ±10% of the stated range are acceptable provided drawings clearly annotate target program compliance. The ±10% tolerance is a **concept-phase planning tolerance only**; detailed design must comply with exact Addendum 03 ranges. Source: Addendum 03 §1.16 (room sizing clarification).

| Program Element | Area Range | Special Requirement | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fire Apparatus Bays** | 2,000–2,200 sf per bay | Overhead door height: **16 ft minimum clear opening**; bay sump required; direct exhaust ventilation (2 apparatus per bay) | Addendum 03 §1.14, §1.16 |
| **Public Works Workshop Bays** | 2,000–2,200 sf per bay | Bay sump required; adequate ventilation for occasional vehicle idling + very occasional welding | Addendum 03 §1.14, §1.16 |
| **Bunker Gear Storage Room** | 200–350 sf | **40 bunker gear lockers** required; **room-level ventilation required** | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **Duty Gear Room** | 350–550 sf | — | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **EMS Storage** | 50–70 sf | — | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **Decontamination Room** | 150–200 sf | Plumbing connection required | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **Decontamination Showers (×2)** | 50–60 sf each | Two separate rooms; plumbing required | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **SCBA Room** | 150–200 sf | Proximity to apparatus bay preferred | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **Compressor Room** | 100–150 sf | Sound isolation provisions | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **First Aid / PPE Storage** | 100–150 sf | — | Addendum 03 §1.16 |
| **All Bay Sumps** | TBD (location and qty per layout) | Required in all apparatus and PW bays for snow melting and minor washing | Addendum 03 §1.14 |
| **Water Fill Stations (×2)** | 2" minimum pipe diameter each | One in fire apparatus bay; one in PW bay | Addendum 03 §1.15 |

> **Note:** Rooms beyond the above list (offices, kitchen, meeting room/ICP, residential quarters, washrooms, mechanical room, electrical room) must also be shown per Appendix B (Functional Program). Their sizes are not constrained by Addendum 03 ranges and must meet building code minimums. (Addendum 01: missing dimensions are intentional; designer proposes; spaces must at minimum meet code.)
>
> **TBD (Lensing item A-002):** The full Appendix B room list -- including non-Addendum 03 rooms with their areas, equipment requirements, and adjacency notes -- has not been extracted into this deliverable set. This extraction is required before AR-018 (Full Functional Program compliance) can be verified. The Architect must extract and cross-reference the complete Appendix B room list prior to concept floor plan layout. (Source: Appendix B -- location TBD; RFP §7.1.1.)

### Roof & Building Envelope Requirements

| Requirement | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Solar-Capable Roof Orientation** | Flat, south, west, or southwest aspect | Addendum 03 §1.14 |

### Drawing Standards (TBD at Time of Production)

| Standard Element | Typical Approach | Notes |
