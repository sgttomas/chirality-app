# Architectural Concept Package — Guidance

**Document ID:** Guidance_DEL-02-01
**Deliverable ID:** DEL-02-01
**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** DRAFT (Pass 3 — Semantic Lensing Enrichment)

---

## Purpose

The Architectural Concept Package provides the **visual foundation** for the proposal. It demonstrates to the Town of Penhold Evaluation Committee that the Design-Builder understands the operational requirements of an integrated Fire Hall and Public Works facility, can arrange all programmed spaces correctly, and has incorporated every Addendum 03 clarification into the concept design.

This deliverable directly drives **OBJ-003: Proposed Conceptual Design (20 pts)** — the highest-weighted single technical criterion in the proposal (Decomposition §6). A weak or incomplete concept package is the single largest recoverable source of lost technical score.

The concept drawings are not merely compliant artifacts; they are a persuasive communication tool. They must tell a coherent story about how this building will work for Fire Hall and Public Works staff day-to-day, and they must do so clearly enough that an Evaluation Committee member who has never visited a fire station can understand the logic.

---

## Principles

### P-001: Program-First Layout

**Statement:** The floor plan is organized around the **functional workflow** of Fire Hall and Public Works operations — not geometry, aesthetics, or budget convenience.

**Rationale (from source):** RFP §7.1.1 requires that the concept demonstrate "clear, functional" compliance with the Owner Statement of Requirements and Functional Program. The evaluation weights this most highly (20 pts). Decomposition SOW-0009 and SOW-0010 require embedding Addendum 03 program clarifications into the concept.

**Practice:**
- Begin with an adjacency diagram before drawing walls. Ask: "Where does a piece of apparatus go from call → return → decon → gear storage? Where does a PW crew go from vehicle return → park → workshop → store?" The floor plan must answer these flows visually and logically.
- Key workflow clusters (see Examples section for diagram): Fire Apparatus Zone, Decontamination Zone, Gear Storage Zone, Public Works Zone, Administrative/Shared Zone.
- The second-storey option (Addendum 03 §1.17) is a tool to stack shared spaces (offices, kitchen, ICP meeting room, residential quarters) above the apparatus zone to free up ground-floor area for operational spaces. Use it deliberately, not as default.

### P-002: Clear-Span is a Hard Constraint

**Statement:** Fire and PW bays require **column-free clear-span floor areas**. Structural columns must not intrude into these zones.

**Rationale:** Apparatus bays at 2,000–2,200 sf (Addendum 03 §1.16) imply approximately 40' × 50–55' footprint per bay. A standard apparatus (fire truck or pumper) requires a turning radius of 30–40 ft. Any column within the bay operating zone obstructs vehicle movement and can damage apparatus.

**Practice:**
- Coordinate the column grid with the Structural Engineer (DEL-02-03) **before** committing to a floor plan layout.
- For two or more adjacent bays, a long-span truss or post-and-beam system is typically required. This is a structural decision that constrains the architectural layout; get it early.
- The structural clear-span requirement also affects building height (truss depth adds to floor-to-floor height); confirm this with DEL-02-03 before establishing floor-to-floor heights on elevations.

### P-003: Addendum 03 Requirements Are Embedded, Not Appended

**Statement:** All Addendum 03 special requirements must be **visibly embedded** in the drawings — they must be legible to an evaluator looking at the floor plan, elevation, or section without reading a separate narrative.

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 governs (Decomposition §2). The evaluation criteria (OBJ-003, 20 pts) assess whether the concept addresses site constraints and addenda. If evaluators cannot see compliance on the drawings, they cannot score it positively.

**Practice:** The following Addendum 03 items must be explicitly annotated (not just spatially implied) on the drawings:
- "16 FT CLEAR OPENING" labeled on each overhead door (floor plan + elevation + section)
- "SUMP TYP." labeled in each apparatus and PW bay slab
- "40 BUNKER GEAR LOCKERS" labeled in the bunker gear storage room with locker layout shown
- "ROOM-LEVEL VENTILATION REQUIRED" noted in the bunker gear room
- "2" MIN. WATER FILL STATION" noted in fire apparatus bay and PW bay locations
- Solar roof orientation annotated on elevations: "FLAT ROOF — SOLAR-CAPABLE ORIENTATION PER ADDENDUM 03 §1.14"
- Second-storey, if used, labeled "UPPER FLOOR — SHARED SPACES PER ADDENDUM 03 §1.17" on section

### P-004: Sump and Drainage Integration is Not Optional

**Statement:** Floor sumps in all apparatus and PW bays are structural and mechanical design constraints that must be **spatially located** in the concept floor plan.

**Rationale:** Sumps are required per Addendum 03 §1.14 for snow melting and minor vehicle washing. A sump requires: slab penetration (structural reinforcing zone), a drainage pump (mechanical), and a connection to the building drainage system (plumbing/civil). Failing to locate sumps early forces costly redesign of slab, drainage, and mechanical rough-in during detailed design.

**Practice:** Show sump locations on the concept floor plan. Note approximate drainage direction. Coordinate with DEL-02-03 (Structural) for slab reinforcing zones and with DEL-02-04 (Mechanical) for pump sizing. Sumps are typically located at the lowest point of the bay slab; the floor drain slope direction determines the sump position relative to the overhead door.

### P-005: Ventilation Zones Require Spatial Reservations

**Statement:** Fire apparatus bay direct exhaust ventilation and bunker gear room ventilation are **operationally critical** and require dedicated spatial reservations in the floor plan and structural section.

**Rationale:** Addendum 03 §1.14 requires direct exhaust ventilation for 2 apparatus per bay. "Direct exhaust" means ducted removal of vehicle exhaust fumes immediately at the vehicle tailpipe — not dilution ventilation. This requires: dedicated exhaust duct runs (vertical rise through roof, or horizontal routing to exterior), intake air provisions, and an equipment room or roof-mounted unit. The bunker gear room ventilation (Addendum 03 §1.16) is a separate air quality requirement for removing carcinogen residue from turnout gear.

**Practice:** On the concept floor plan, reserve a **ductwork vertical chase zone** adjacent to or above the apparatus bay. On the section drawing, show where the exhaust duct rises from the bay slab level to the roof. Note "DIRECT EXHAUST VENTILATION — 2 APPARATUS PER BAY — REFER TO DEL-02-04 (MECHANICAL CONCEPT)" at each apparatus bay.

### P-006: Roof Orientation is Mandatory, Not Decorative

**Statement:** Addendum 03 §1.14 requires a solar-capable roof. The orientation choice (flat, south, west, or southwest) is a **mandatory design decision** that must be made at concept phase and clearly shown on all four elevations.

**Rationale:** If the roof is not oriented correctly, solar-ready provisions (structural reinforcing for future panels, electrical conduit rough-in, roof penetrations) cannot be designed correctly in detailed design. A flat roof is the simplest solar-ready solution; it provides 360° orientation flexibility for future panel placement. A pitched south-facing roof is viable but requires more structural engineering.

**Practice:** Annotate roof orientation on all four elevation drawings. If a flat roof is chosen, note "FLAT ROOF — SOLAR-CAPABLE; FUTURE PV ARRAY PROVISIONS PER ADDENDUM 03 §1.14." If a pitched roof, note the pitch and orientation. Cross-reference to DEL-02-05 (Electrical) for solar rough-in details.

### P-007: Accessibility is a Compliance Floor, Not a Design Goal

**Statement:** The concept floor plan must demonstrate that a **barrier-free accessible path** from the main building entry to all publicly accessible areas (offices, meeting room, accessible washroom) is spatially feasible.

**Rationale:** NBCC 2020 and Alberta Building Code require accessible design. The Evaluation Committee will assess whether the concept is viable as a code-compliant building. If an accessible path cannot be traced on the concept floor plan, the concept fails its most basic compliance test. Detailed compliance analysis is in DEL-03-06, but the concept must show feasibility.

**Practice:** On the concept floor plan, lightly annotate the primary accessible circulation path: "ACCESSIBLE PATH" with arrows. Confirm that 48" minimum corridor width and 36" minimum door width are achievable in key zones (lobby, corridor, meeting room, accessible washroom approach). Elevator or lift provision is required if upper-floor shared spaces are used (Addendum 03 §1.17 two-storey option).

## Considerations

### C-001: Operational Credibility Over Visual Impact

The concept drawings will be evaluated by the Town of Penhold Project Committee (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk per Decomposition §5) — operational staff, not architects. A floor plan that clearly shows how a fire crew operates day-to-day will score better than a visually striking but operationally unclear concept.

Prioritize: labeled rooms in logical sequence; clear apparatus bay approach and egress; visible decon/gear workflow; intuitive PW vehicle access. Supplementary 3D renderings add visual appeal but do not substitute for a legible floor plan.

### C-002: 12-Acre Site Is Constrained on Both Ends

The 12-acre developable area is bounded by the flood fringe (8 acres not developable) and must accommodate: the main building, Cold Storage (60'×100'), parking (staff, visitor, apparatus), fire apparatus access routes, site utilities, and site grading. A building footprint that is too large may not accommodate all required site elements within the 12 acres. Coordinate building massing with DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept) before finalizing floor plan dimensions.

ASSUMPTION: The 12-acre developable area is confirmed per Addendum 03 §1.1. The exact boundary between developable and flood-fringe land requires civil/survey confirmation (survey files provided after award per Addendum 03 §1.8; concept-phase placement should use best available reference materials from Appendix E-F).

### C-003: Locker Count in a Small Room

Forty bunker gear lockers in a room sized 200–350 sf requires a very specific locker configuration. Standard full-height bunker gear lockers are typically 21" wide × 24" deep × 78" high per unit. Forty units in a linear arrangement would require approximately 70 linear feet of wall space — not achievable in a 200–350 sf room with standard wall-mounted linear arrangement. Solutions:
- Double-sided back-to-back islands (two-row arrangement reduces wall length requirement to ~35 linear feet)
- Custom compact lockers (narrower or shorter units)
- L-shaped or U-shaped locker arrangement (uses corners efficiently)

This is a non-trivial space-planning challenge. Show a schematic locker layout on the concept floor plan with annotated row count and locker count.

### C-004: Backup Generator Location Affects Building Layout

The backup generator must support minimum loads: kitchen, ICP meeting room, 2 bathrooms, and bay door secondary opening mechanism (Addendum 03 §1.15). Generator location options have significantly different architectural implications:
- **Exterior pad/shed:** Simplest civil and mechanical; requires long electrical conduit runs; outdoor enclosure for cold climate; easier refueling and servicing; commonly preferred for diesel generators
- **Interior equipment room with outdoor louvers:** Space-efficient; requires large clearances and exhaust routing to exterior; fire-rated separation
- **Integrated with mechanical room:** Maximum compactness; most complex ventilation and structural implications; generally not preferred for diesel generators

No architectural preference is stated in the RFP. The generator location should be coordinated with DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept) and noted on the concept floor plan as "DIESEL STANDBY GENERATOR — LOCATION TBD (EXTERIOR OR INTERIOR ROOM — REFER TO DEL-02-04)." See Conflict Table entry CONF-G01.

### C-006: Apparatus Bay Count Determination (Lensing B-004)

The number of fire apparatus bays and PW workshop bays is the **single largest driver** of building footprint, structural clear-span scope, and total program area. Addendum 03 §1.16 provides per-bay sizing (2,000-2,200 sf per bay) but does not state the total number of bays required. This count must be determined from Appendix A (Owner Statement of Requirements) and/or Appendix B (Functional Program).

**Methodology for bay count determination:**
- **Fire apparatus bays:** Driven by current and projected apparatus fleet size, simultaneous deployment requirements (how many vehicles must be housed and immediately available), and future expansion considerations. Each bay accommodates 2 apparatus per Addendum 03 direct exhaust requirements.
- **PW workshop bays:** Driven by PW vehicle fleet size, seasonal equipment storage needs, and indoor maintenance/workshop requirements.
- **Decision factors:** Fleet composition, response time requirements, mutual aid agreements, growth projections over the 50-year design life, and Owner operational preferences.

**ASSUMPTION (Lensing B-004):** Bay count is available in Appendix A/B but has not been extracted. The Architect must extract this datum before floor plan layout alternatives can be meaningfully compared. (Source: Appendix A/B -- location TBD; Addendum 03 §1.16 for per-bay sizing.)

### C-007: Code Applicability Rationale (Lensing C-001)

NBCC 2020 and Alberta Building Code are listed as "ASSUMPTION: applicable" in the Specification (Standards section). The rationale for this assumption:
- **NBCC 2020** is the current edition of the National Building Code of Canada and is the standard baseline for all building projects in Alberta.
- **Alberta Building Code** adopts NBCC 2020 with Alberta-specific amendments (snow loads, wind loads, fire service requirements).
- At concept phase, the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) has not been formally consulted; code applicability is confirmed during detailed design permitting.
- The concept-phase assumption is **conservative**: applying the most current code edition ensures the concept design will be at least as stringent as what the AHJ requires.
- **Risk if incorrect:** If a different code edition applies (unlikely for new construction in Alberta), room sizing or fire separation requirements may differ. The impact at concept phase is minimal because concept drawings demonstrate spatial feasibility, not detailed code compliance.
- Detailed code compliance analysis is assigned to DEL-03-01 (Architectural Design Brief).

(Source: Specification Standards table; Decomposition DEL-03-01 definition.)

### C-008: Site Context Plan Quality Responsibility (Lensing F-003)

The site context plan is authored by the Civil Engineer (DEL-02-02) but is included in the Architectural Concept Package for evaluator review. The Architect must understand that:
- **Quality responsibility:** Although the site context plan is drafted by Civil, its inclusion in the architectural package means the Architect bears quality-assurance responsibility for ensuring the plan is legible, correctly scaled, and consistent with the architectural floor plan.
- **OBJ-003 scoring impact:** The Evaluation Committee assesses the concept package holistically. A site context plan that contradicts the architectural floor plan (e.g., building footprint mismatch, parking layout inconsistency) will undermine the coherence of the concept presentation and may reduce the OBJ-003 score.
- **Coordination action:** The Architect should review the site context plan against the finalized floor plan for geometric consistency (building footprint dimensions match, north orientation consistent, parking/access compatible) before PDF assembly.

(Source: Decomposition DEL-02-02 definition; RFP §7.1.1; OBJ-003.)

### C-009: Evaluation Panel Intelligence (Lensing E-002)

**TBD:** Are there known competing proposals or evaluation panel preferences that should inform concept design strategy? Relevant intelligence could include:
- Panel familiarity with fire station design (have they evaluated fire hall proposals before?)
- Preference for traditional vs. modern architectural aesthetics
- Known site planning priorities (e.g., emphasis on parking, visibility from Waskasoo Avenue, fire apparatus access speed)
- Whether the panel has toured other recently-built combined fire hall / public works facilities

C-001 notes that evaluators are "operational staff, not architects" (Pendergast -- PM, Kowalchuk -- Operations Manager, Binnendyk -- CAO per Decomposition §5). Beyond this, no further intelligence about panel preferences is available in the current source material.

**PROPOSAL:** Consult Proposal Manager or project lead for any available evaluation panel intelligence; if obtained, record here and incorporate into concept design strategy. This information, if available, could meaningfully influence rendering style, floor plan presentation emphasis, and design narrative tone for OBJ-003 scoring.

(Source: Decomposition §5 -- evaluation committee; RFP §7.1.1 -- scoring criteria; Lensing E-002.)

### C-005: Second-Storey Implications for Fire Safety and Accessibility

If the two-storey option (Addendum 03 §1.17) is used for shared spaces, NBCC 2020 requires:
- At least one accessible exit from the upper floor (elevator or stairway with lift)
- Appropriate occupant load calculation for egress stairway design
- Fire separation between residential quarters and other occupancies
- Sprinkler system design implications (likely required per NBCC occupancy classification)

These are not barriers to the two-storey option but are design constraints that must be spatially feasible in the concept layout. Note relevant NBCC requirements on concept drawings or in design coordination notes.

## Trade-Offs

### T-001: Single-Storey vs. Two-Storey Layout

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages | Recommended Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single-Storey** | Simple structure; no vertical egress required; straightforward HVAC; lower construction risk | Larger footprint; may challenge 12-acre site constraints with parking and Cold Storage | Viable if site area permits; evaluate footprint against civil site plan before selecting |
| **Two-Storey (shared spaces above)** | Smaller footprint; frees ground floor for maximum apparatus/PW operations area; efficient land use | More complex structure; elevator or accessible stair required; more complex HVAC routing; residential fire separation | Permitted per Addendum 03 §1.17; recommended if site footprint analysis shows single-storey cannot accommodate all required site elements |

**Resolution Path:** Coordinate with Civil Engineer (DEL-02-02) during early concept development. If site footprint analysis shows single-storey is feasible, prefer it for structural simplicity and cost. If not, the two-storey option is explicitly permitted and should be used.

### T-002: Apparatus Bay Configuration

| Option | Arrangement | Trade-Off |
|---|---|---|
| **Side-by-Side** | 2 bays parallel, each ~40'×50–55'; total width ~80'+ | Easy apparatus positioning and visibility; building may be wide but shallow |
| **In-Line (Front-to-Back)** | Bays arrayed longitudinally; narrower width but longer depth | Better for long, narrow site constraints; more complex apparatus access routing |
| **L-Shaped / Compound** | One wing for fire apparatus, separate wing for PW bays | Enables clear separation of fire and PW operations; more complex site planning |

**Resolution Path:** Determine from site plan analysis (DEL-02-02) which arrangement best fits the 12-acre developable footprint with required parking, access, and Cold Storage. No single configuration is mandated by RFP or addenda.

### T-003: Rendering vs. No Rendering

| Option | Effort | Scoring Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Photorealistic 3D Rendering** | 40–80 hours | High; demonstrates design maturity and investment; memorable for evaluators | Pursue if design team has rendering capability in-house or can engage vendor within timeline |
| **Axonometric / Massing Diagram** | 10–20 hours | Moderate; adds visual context at lower cost | Good compromise; shows building massing and site context clearly |
| **Drawings Only (No Rendering)** | 0 hours | Lowest; concept is harder to visualize without 3D context | Not recommended for 20-pt scored criterion |

**Resolution Path:** Decision must be made by **Day 5 of concept phase (end of Week 1)** to allocate design hours. OBJ-003 is 20 pts -- the highest technical criterion. A rendering or massing diagram is a meaningful competitive differentiator.

### T-004: Flat Roof vs. Pitched Roof

| Option | Solar Readiness | Aesthetics | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flat Roof (TPO or similar)** | Highest — omnidirectional future PV placement; simplest electrical rough-in | Modern, minimal appearance | Lowest structural depth; most cost-effective solar strategy |
| **Low-Pitch Gable (south-facing)** | Good if pitch correctly aligned; requires careful PV panel tilt angle engineering | Traditional fire hall appearance | Slightly higher structural complexity |
| **Clerestory / Monitor Roof** | Good for south-facing clerestory with integrated daylighting | Distinctive aesthetic; visible design intent | Higher construction cost; more complex structural and envelope detail |

**Resolution Path:** Addendum 03 §1.14 mandates solar-capable orientation. Flat roof is the lowest-cost, most flexible solar strategy. Pitched roofs are viable but add engineering complexity. Recommend flat roof unless aesthetic or site grading conditions strongly favor an alternative.

### T-005: Centralized vs. Distributed Sump Strategy

| Option | Description | Trade-Off |
|---|---|---|
| **Distributed (individual bay sumps)** | Each bay has its own sump and pump; independent operation | Higher pump count; more maintenance points; lower redundancy per pump |
| **Centralized (shared sump room)** | Common sump room with dual/backup pumps serving all bays via floor channels | Fewer pumps; easier maintenance access; better redundancy; more complex slab drainage routing |

**Resolution Path:** Coordinate with Mechanical Engineer (DEL-02-04) and Structural Engineer (DEL-02-03). Centralized approach is generally preferred for municipal operations (fewer items to maintain; single maintenance access point). Show sump room/location on concept floor plan with drainage direction arrows.

### EX-002: Bunker Gear Locker Room Schematic Layout

Fitting 40 locker units in a 200–350 sf room requires careful configuration. The following illustrates a double-sided island arrangement:

```
BUNKER GEAR LOCKER ROOM (target: 200–350 SF)
Assumed locker size: 18" wide × 24" deep × 78" high (compact firefighter locker unit)

  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  [Row 1: 20 lockers, north side of island]  │
  │  Row depth: 24" (lockers) + 42" (aisle)      │
  │  + 24" (lockers) = 90" = 7.5 ft island depth │
  │  Row width: 20 × 18" = 360" = 30 ft           │
  │  [Row 2: 20 lockers, south side of island]  │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  Room dimensions required: ~30 ft × ~12 ft = ~360 SF (within 200–350 range if row count/locker size adjusted)
```

**ASSUMPTION:** Standard compact 18"-wide locker units assumed. Actual locker unit dimensions (per FF&E procurement per Addendum 03 §1.18) may vary; schematic layout above is illustrative. A 30 ft × 12 ft (360 sf) arrangement slightly exceeds the 350 sf upper range — the design team should confirm locker specifications and adjust room sizing or locker arrangement to achieve compliance within the stated range. This may require custom narrower lockers or a 3-row versus 2-row island arrangement.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CONF-G01** | Backup generator location (exterior pad vs. interior room): no preference stated in RFP; has significant impact on floor plan layout, mechanical routing, and site plan | Addendum 03 §1.15 (generator required; minimum loads specified; secondary opening mechanism required) | Decomposition DEL-02-04 (generator scope assigned to mechanical; "location TBD") | Datasheet (Integration Points), Specification (AR-C06), Guidance (C-004), Procedure (Step 4 coordination) | PROPOSAL: Exterior pad preferred for diesel generators (easier serviceability, natural ventilation, cold-climate considerations); confirm with Mechanical Engineer (DEL-02-04) | TBD |
| **CONF-G02** | Single-storey vs. two-storey layout: Addendum 03 §1.17 permits but does not require second storey for shared spaces; the choice significantly impacts structural system, egress, HVAC routing, and site footprint | Addendum 03 §1.17 (second storey acceptable for shared spaces) | Site constraint (12-acre developable area must accommodate building + parking + Cold Storage + access routes) | Datasheet (Attributes), Specification (AR-016), Guidance (T-001, P-001), Procedure (Step 3) | PROPOSAL: Evaluate site footprint in coordination with DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept) before committing; if single-storey footprint fits within 12 acres with all required site elements, prefer single-storey; otherwise, use two-storey | TBD |
| **CONF-G03** | Functional Program (Appendix B) room list not fully extracted into this deliverable: rooms beyond the Addendum 03 sizing ranges (offices, kitchen, ICP/meeting room, residential quarters, mechanical, electrical) are referenced but not explicitly dimensioned | Addendum 03 §1.16 (provides sizing ranges for listed rooms only) | Appendix B (Functional Program — detailed room list not yet extracted in this pass) | Specification (AR-018), Procedure (Step 2) | PROPOSAL: Architect must extract full room list from Appendix B and cross-check against floor plan at detailed design phase; concept phase uses Addendum 03 ranges as primary constraints | TBD — requires Appendix B review |
| **CONF-G04 (Lensing B-003)** | Bunker gear locker room sizing: Guidance EX-002 calculates a double-sided island layout at 30 ft x 12 ft = 360 sf for 40 lockers, which exceeds the Addendum 03 upper range of 350 sf. The contradiction is acknowledged in EX-002 notes but the question of whether the room may exceed 350 sf (or must use narrower lockers / alternative configuration to stay within range) is unresolved. | Addendum 03 §1.16 (200-350 sf range for bunker gear storage room) | Guidance EX-002 (360 sf calculation based on 18"-wide compact lockers in double-sided island) | Datasheet (Conditions & Requirements > Bunker Gear Storage Room: 200-350 sf), Specification (AR-004: 200-350 sf), Guidance (EX-002: 360 sf), Procedure (Step 5 locker layout) | PROPOSAL: Addendum 03 governs; the 350 sf upper limit is the compliance ceiling. Design team must either (a) use custom narrower lockers (e.g., 15"-16" wide) to fit 40 lockers within 350 sf, or (b) adopt a 3-row island or L-shaped configuration, or (c) request Owner clarification if 40 lockers physically cannot fit within 350 sf. Record locker specification source in FF&E notes. | TBD |
