# Deliverable: DEL-02-01 Architectural Concept Package

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** The Architectural Concept Package exists to translate a combined functional program (fire hall, public works, shared administrative spaces) into a coherent spatial arrangement -- floor plans, elevations, sections, and massing views -- that demonstrates programmatic compliance, operational workflow viability, and multi-discipline integration at concept phase. It serves simultaneously as a compliance instrument (proving addenda and program requirements are met) and a persuasive design communication to evaluators assessing concept quality.
