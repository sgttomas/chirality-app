| **SR-008** | Narrative shall address concrete apron structural design for all overhead door access points, designed to support service vehicle weights | RFP OSR §10.3.10 (p. 42) | Aprons are explicit RFP requirement; structural design must address vehicle loads | Narrative inclusion of apron scope and load basis |

| **SR-011** | Narrative shall address structural support for a solar-capable roof, acknowledging that roof framing must accommodate future solar panel loads | Addendum 03 §1.17 | Solar-capable roofing is a mandatory requirement; structural frame must not preclude it | Narrative reference to solar load provision |
| **SR-012** | Narrative shall describe the cost-effectiveness rationale for the structural system selection, consistent with the Owner's design philosophy (practical, cost-effective, easy to maintain) | RFP OSR §10.3.4 (p. 39) | OSR §10.3.4 states all systems must be "practical, energy efficient, cost effective, and easy to maintain" | Narrative justification of cost-value basis |

| **SR-016** | Narrative shall acknowledge seismic design classification for Penhold, Alberta per NBCC; although Penhold is in a low-seismic zone, NBCC requires seismic design consideration for all structures | NBCC (applicable edition); RFP OSR §10.3.5 (implied) | NBCC mandates seismic design consideration regardless of seismic zone; omission of seismic classification creates a regulatory gap. **ASSUMPTION:** Penhold is low-seismic; site classification and seismic hazard values to be confirmed from NBCC climatic data. [C-001] | Narrative statement on seismic classification and design approach |
| **SR-017** | If the architectural concept (DEL-02-01) includes a second storey for shared spaces, narrative shall confirm the structural system addresses inter-storey load path, floor framing, and lateral force resistance for the upper level | Addendum 03 §1.5 (second storey acceptable); Guidance C-008 | A second storey adds non-trivial structural requirements (inter-storey shear, floor loads); these must not be assumed trivial and should be explicitly addressed if applicable. [C-002] | Narrative description of second-storey structural approach (conditional on architectural concept) |
