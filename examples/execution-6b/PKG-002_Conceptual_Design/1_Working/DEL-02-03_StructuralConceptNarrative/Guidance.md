# Guidance — DEL-02-03: Structural Concept Narrative

---

## Purpose

The Structural Concept Narrative positions structural engineering as an integral, cost-effective partner in the overall conceptual design. The narrative must demonstrate that the proposed structural system:

1. **Supports the architectural layout** — floor plans, room adjacencies, building heights, and clear spans for apparatus bays respond to the architectural concept (DEL-02-01)
2. **Works within site constraints** — foundation strategy is grounded in existing 2021 geotechnical data; site grading and drainage are coordinated with civil (DEL-02-02)
3. **Meets all program and addenda requirements** — apparatus bay loads, bay sumps, 16 ft overhead doors, solar-capable roof structural support
4. **Optimizes cost and value** — system selection is justified on cost-effectiveness and practicality, consistent with OSR §10.3.4 ("practical, cost effective, easy to maintain")
5. **Enables future growth** — structural framework designed so future expansion is cost-effective and minimizes disruption (RFP OSR §10.2.1)
6. **Supports 50/20-year design life targets** — structural choices acknowledge durability obligations, with detail delegated to DEL-05-02

**Evaluation context:** OBJ-003 (Proposed Conceptual Design, 20 pts) is the highest-weighted technical criterion. A strong structural concept narrative demonstrates comprehensive, coordinated thinking — not just structural adequacy.

**OBJ-003 Structural Content Priorities (ASSUMPTION — inferred from RFP evaluation structure):** While the RFP does not publish detailed sub-criteria for structural content within OBJ-003, the following elements are likely to carry weight with the evaluation committee based on the OSR emphasis areas:
1. **Clear structural system rationale** tied to cost-effectiveness and practicality (OSR §10.3.4)
2. **Explicit coordination** with architectural concept (DEL-02-01) and site plan (DEL-02-02) demonstrating integrated design thinking
3. **Comprehensive treatment of Addendum 03 requirements** (bay sumps, door heights, solar roof) showing attention to owner amendments
4. **Credible foundation strategy** grounded in Appendix D data
5. **Future expansion provisions** demonstrating long-term value (OSR §10.2.1)
6. **Design life and durability acknowledgment** connecting to the 15-point durability criterion (PKG-005)

The narrative author should ensure each of these areas receives substantive treatment rather than passing reference. [F-002]

## Principles

### P-001 — Justify System Choice on Value, Not Default

The evaluator should not need to assume why the structural system was selected. Explain why this specific system is the right choice for this facility, its loads, site conditions, and cost targets.

- Good: "A structural steel moment frame provides cost-effective clear spans for apparatus bays (2000–2200 sf each per Addendum 03) and simplifies future expansion compared to load-bearing masonry."
- Avoid: "A steel frame is proposed." (no rationale)

### P-002 — Ground Foundation Strategy in Real Geotechnical Data

The 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) is the only site investigation data available for this proposal. Reference it explicitly. If report content is available, cite bearing capacity, groundwater level, and frost depth findings. Whether or not full report content is accessible, state clearly: "Foundation design is based on the existing 2021 geotechnical investigation report (Appendix D); no additional geotechnical investigation is included in this proposal per DEC-013."

Source: RFP OSR §10.3.2 (p. 39) — "A Geotechnical Investigation was completed for the site and the report can be found in Appendix D."

### P-003 — Embed All Addendum 03 Special Requirements

Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024) adds structural-relevant requirements that must be explicitly addressed:
- **Bay sumps** (§1.8): "All bays require sumps to allow for snow melting and minor washing." Floor slab must be designed with integrated sumps and drainage slopes.
- **Overhead door height** (§1.10): "16 feet height for the main building doors." Structural framing must achieve this clear opening; header/lintel design must accommodate door width and structural loads.
- **Solar-capable roofing** (§1.17): Roof orientation (flat, south, west, or southwest) with solar panel accommodation in future; structural roof framing must not preclude future panel loads.

These are not optional; they are embedded program requirements per SOW-0010.

### P-004 — Distinguish Main Building from Cold Storage

The Main Building and Cold Storage serve fundamentally different functions. The structural narrative must address them separately:
- **Main Building**: Complex, mixed-use facility with high equipment loads, bay sumps, overhead doors, office/residential above, 50-year design life. Structural steel framing typically preferred for clear spans and expansion flexibility.
- **Cold Storage (60' x 100')**: Simple unheated equipment storage. RFP OSR §10.3.6 explicitly states "no foundation preference assuming the most cost-effective solution would be pursued (i.e. post and frame construction (pole shed))." 20-year design life. Simpler detailing appropriate.

### P-005 — Show Durability Thinking at Concept Stage

A 50-year main building and 20-year Cold Storage are not casual targets. The structural concept should acknowledge the high-corrosion environments in apparatus bays (wash water, vehicle fluids, de-icing) and Cold Storage (unheated freeze-thaw exposure). Reference the detailed durability strategy in DEL-05-02 rather than repeating it here.

Example: "Structural steel in apparatus bays will be protected with high-performance coatings appropriate to chloride and moisture exposure; detailed corrosion protection strategy is provided in DEL-05-02."

### P-006 — Coordinate Explicitly with Upstream Deliverables

The structural concept narrative should position itself as responding to, not independent of, the architectural concept. Cite DEL-02-01 for clear span requirements and DEL-02-02 for site/foundation context. Resolve any conflicts before they appear in the final proposal.

### P-007 — Avoid Over-Specification

This is a concept narrative, not detailed design. Do not size every beam or specify every bolt. Communicate the structural logic and load path at a level that an evaluation committee can assess. Detailed design occurs in post-award phases.

## Considerations

### C-001 — Geotechnical Report Accessibility

The 2021 geotechnical investigation report (Appendix D) is referenced in RFP OSR §10.3.2 as available to proponents. If specific bearing capacity, groundwater, and frost depth data are available from the report, incorporate them. If not, use conservative typical Alberta values and label as ASSUMPTION. State clearly that field verification will occur during construction per CCDC 14-2013. The narrative must not be silent on geotechnical assumptions.

### C-002 — Equipment Load Estimates

The RFP OSR §10.3.5 describes the specific equipment types operating in the building: type 1 fire engines, type 1 aerial ladders, graders, tandem dump units, loaders, street sweepers, bobcats, and construction-type equipment. Public Works operates out of the main structure. Load estimates should be conservative but realistic. Document them explicitly.

- **ASSUMPTION:** Type 1 fire apparatus GVW range approximately 25–40 tonnes (250–400 kN), with heavy aerial apparatus at the upper end (35–40 tonnes / 350–400 kN); typical tandem grader approximately 20 tonnes (200 kN). Concentrated wheel loads govern slab design. [A-003 normalized: full range stated with heavy aerial upper bound clarified; Procedure Step 4 aligned to this range]
- Floor live load for apparatus/PW bays: not less than 10 kN/m² recommended for operations; vehicle wheel loads govern locally.

### C-003 — Bay Sump Structural Integration

Addendum 03 §1.8 explicitly requires sumps in all bays for snow melting and minor washing. The structural narrative must address:
- Sump pit construction (structural pit below slab, waterproofed)
- Slab slope to sumps (typically 1–2% toward sump)
- Sump pump access (mechanical coordination, DEL-02-04)
- Structural detailing around sump opening to maintain slab capacity

This is one of the few concrete Addendum 03 structural requirements — it must not be overlooked.

### C-004 — Cold Storage Building Structural Options

The RFP OSR §10.3.6 notes two approaches for Cold Storage:
1. Post-and-frame (pole shed) — noted as likely most cost-effective
2. Alternative solutions — pricing welcome

The Cold Storage building also requires two (2) overhead doors 16' x 16' (OSR §10.3.9). It must have "openings on two opposite sides, each opening to include a person door and overhead door" (OSR §10.2). The narrative should acknowledge the structural framing for these openings.

The Cold Storage building needs ventilation to prevent condensation and icing (OSR §11.1.2), which has structural coordination implications (openings, louvers). Reference to DEL-02-04 is appropriate.

### C-005 — Roof Structure and Solar Loads

Addendum 03 §1.17 requires solar-capable roofing with orientation (flat, south, west, or southwest). The structural roof framing must support the dead load of future solar panels in addition to snow, wind, and self-weight. Typical crystalline PV panels weigh approximately 10–15 kg/m² (0.1–0.15 kN/m²). This is a modest additional load but must be acknowledged in the structural concept. The narrative should confirm the roof structure is designed with this provision.

Source: OSR §10.3.9 also states: "Solar loading capabilities must be considered for future solar additions."

### C-006 — Design-Build Liability Context

Under CCDC 14-2013 with Appendix J Supplementary Conditions, the Design-Builder bears performance risk for structural design. The narrative should reflect this responsibility: clear, committed structural approach with no unresolved "TBD" fundamental system choices. Load assumptions should be stated clearly and conservatively.

**Concept-stage verification of CCDC 14-2013 responsibility:** At proposal stage, the narrative cannot demonstrate full performance compliance (that occurs through detailed design and construction). However, the narrative should include at minimum: (a) an explicit statement that the Design-Builder accepts structural design performance responsibility per CCDC 14-2013, (b) identification of the key performance parameters the Design-Builder commits to (load resistance, deflection limits, design life), and (c) a statement that field verification of geotechnical conditions will occur during construction as standard practice. This demonstrates the Design-Builder's awareness of and commitment to the contractual risk allocation. [X-003]

### C-007 — Flood Zone and Wetland Awareness

The site has 8 acres in flood fringe (storm pond and dog park area). The 12-acre developable zone is the construction area. However, the structural narrative should acknowledge that site grading coordination (DEL-02-02) confirms no flood zone structural implications for the building footprint. If the geotech report identifies any seasonal groundwater implications for foundation depth, address them.

### C-009 — Regulatory Framework: NBCC and Alberta Building Code Relationship

The Specification lists both the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and the Alberta Building Code (ABC) as applicable standards. Their relationship should be understood as follows:

- **NBCC** is the primary technical standard governing structural design: load calculations (snow, wind, seismic), structural member sizing, and building classification. The NBCC is the authoritative source for structural engineering requirements.
- **Alberta Building Code (ABC)** adopts NBCC provisions (typically with Alberta-specific amendments) and governs building permit issuance, occupancy classification, and AHJ compliance within Alberta.
- For this project, the Structural Engineer designs to NBCC structural requirements; the ABC governs the permitting and occupancy approval process.

**ASSUMPTION:** The applicable NBCC edition is the one adopted by the Alberta Building Code in force at the time of permit application. The specific edition should be confirmed with the Town of Penhold AHJ. [F-001]

### C-008 — Second-Storey Structural Consideration

Addendum 03 §1.5 confirms a second storey is acceptable to accommodate shared spaces. If the architectural concept (DEL-02-01) includes a second storey, the structural narrative must confirm the main frame supports this load path. A second storey adds inter-storey shear frame requirements and floor loads above the ground floor — this must not be assumed trivial.

## Trade-offs

| ID | Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T-001** | Main building framing material | Structural steel moment frame | Reinforced concrete frame | Steel is preferred for apparatus bay clear spans, construction speed, future expansion ease, and cost-effectiveness in Alberta. Concrete offers higher inherent durability but at higher first cost and less modification flexibility. Steel with protective coatings achieves 50-year life cost-effectively. |
| **T-002** | Foundation system — Main Building | Isolated spread footings under main columns | Continuous strip footings or mat foundation | Isolated footings reduce cost, simplify future expansion column additions, and are appropriate if geotech bearing capacity is adequate. Continuous or mat foundations may be required if bearing capacity is low (pending Appendix D review). |
| **T-003** | Bay sump construction | Structural sump pit below slab level | Mechanical surface drain with inline sump | Structural sump pit integrated into slab is more durable and lower long-term maintenance than surface drains susceptible to freezing. Structural integration is consistent with apparatus bay durability requirements. |
| **T-004** | Overhead door structural support | Steel moment frame / deep header beam | Truss system over door opening | Moment frame or deep header beam provides clean clearance and is cost-effective for 16 ft x 16 ft opening. Truss approach adds depth that may conflict with overhead door hardware or clearance requirements. |
| **T-005** | Cold Storage structural system | Post-and-frame (pole shed) | Concrete tilt-up panels | Post-and-frame is explicitly identified in OSR §10.3.6 as likely most cost-effective for this building type. Tilt-up offers speed but higher first cost, less design flexibility, and more complex future modifications. For a 20-year design life storage building, post-and-frame is the preferred starting position. |
| **T-006** | Cold Storage floor | Option 1: Compacted asphalt millings + concrete strips | Option 2: Full concrete floor and aprons | **Recommended starting position: Option 2 (full concrete).** Rationale: Option 2 provides better durability, easier cleaning, and cleaner structural integration — aligned with the Owner's design philosophy of "practical, cost effective, easy to maintain" (OSR §10.3.4). Option 1 is lower first cost but higher long-term maintenance. Both options should be priced per OSR §10.3.8 to give the Owner a choice. **Decision criterion:** If the Owner prioritizes lowest first cost for the 20-year Cold Storage design life, Option 1 is acceptable; if lifecycle cost and maintainability govern, Option 2 is preferred. [D-002] |
| **T-007** | Expansion structural provisions | Regular column grid (isolated footings) | Irregular optimized structural system | Regular column grid (e.g., 20 ft x 30 ft module) adds modest structural cost premium but enables straightforward future expansion. An irregular optimized system saves cost upfront but makes expansion significantly more expensive. Regular grid preferred given OSR §10.2.1 expansion requirement. |

## Examples

### EX-001 — Main Building Structural System Statement (Good)
"The main building is proposed as a structural steel moment-resisting frame with slab-on-grade foundation. Steel framing provides cost-effective clear spans of 40–50 ft for apparatus bays (2,000–2,200 sf each per Addendum 03) without intermediate columns, supporting the architectural concept (DEL-02-01). Open-web steel joists over office and shared spaces reduce structural depth and facilitate mechanical system routing (DEL-02-04). Isolated spread footings under main columns are designed based on the 2021 geotechnical investigation report (Appendix D). No additional geotechnical investigation is included in this proposal (DEC-013)."

### EX-002 — Bay Sump Integration Statement
"Floor slabs in all apparatus bays and PW workshop bays are designed with integral sump pits (approximately 1.2 m x 1.2 m x 600 mm deep) at bay corners, with floor slab sloped at 1.5% toward sump locations. Sumps are waterproofed concrete construction to resist freeze-thaw and moisture ingress; sump pump drainage is coordinated with the civil storm system (DEL-02-02). Slab structural capacity is maintained around sump openings via thickened slab edges. This directly addresses the Addendum 03 §1.8 requirement for sumps in all bays for snow melting and minor washing."

### EX-003 — Foundation Strategy Statement (Against Only Existing Geotech)
"Foundation design is based on the existing 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D), which provides soil bearing capacity, seasonal groundwater levels, and frost depth data for this site. No additional geotechnical investigation is included in this proposal per project decision DEC-013. Isolated spread footings are proposed at an anticipated depth of [TBD per Appendix D frost line and bearing capacity], consistent with standard practice for Penhold, Alberta. Field verification of exposed subgrade conditions will occur during construction as part of standard geotechnical practice under CCDC 14-2013."

### EX-004 — Cold Storage Structural Statement
"The Cold Storage building (60' x 100', unheated equipment storage) is proposed as a post-and-frame steel structure on slab-on-grade, consistent with the OSR §10.3.6 cost-effective approach identified for ancillary storage buildings. Two 16' x 16' overhead doors on opposite building walls are structurally framed with conventional steel headers. The building is designed for a 20-year service life with standard protective coatings on structural steel; detailed durability approach is provided in DEL-05-02."

### EX-005 — Expansion Provisions Statement
"The main building structural grid is based on a 6 m x 9 m (approximately 20 ft x 30 ft) bay module with isolated spread footings, enabling future expansion in both the apparatus bay direction and the office/support zone without requiring removal or modification of existing structural elements. Future column additions can be made with isolated footings on undisturbed soil adjacent to existing foundations. The slab-on-grade can be extended in any direction. This approach minimizes the cost and disruption of future expansion per RFP OSR §10.2.1 Project Success Metrics."

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

The following conflicts were identified during Pass 3 (Semantic Lensing Enrichment). Each requires human ruling before the structural concept narrative is finalized.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CF-001** | Concrete apron thickness (200 mm) stated in Procedure Step 3.6 exceeds apparatus bay slab thickness (150 mm) in Procedure Step 3.5; both support heavy vehicles but rationale for difference not stated | Procedure Step 3.5: "minimum 150 mm (6") thickness" for apparatus bay slab | Procedure Step 3.6: "ASSUMPTION minimum 200 mm (8") concrete" for aprons | Procedure Steps 3.5, 3.6; Datasheet Construction "Concrete aprons" | Structural Engineer — confirm whether apron thickness should differ from bay slab (may be intentional due to concentrated loads at door thresholds vs. distributed bay loads) | TBD [E-002] |
| **CF-002** | Post-disaster importance category exemption stated as fact in Datasheet but no verification of AHJ confirmation exists | Datasheet Attributes: "Not required; AHJ intends to exempt PSB from post-disaster designation" | Specification Verification: no verification row for AHJ exemption confirmation | Datasheet "Post-disaster importance"; Specification Verification | PM / AHJ — obtain written confirmation or reclassify as ASSUMPTION | TBD [A-002] |
