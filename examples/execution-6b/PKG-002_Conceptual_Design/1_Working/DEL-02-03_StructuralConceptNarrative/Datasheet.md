| **Cold Storage occupancy** | Same equipment types as main building (covered seasonal storage); clear span, minimum height | RFP OSR §10.3.5 (p. 40) |
| **Structural importance category** | Not post-disaster critical; AHJ exemption from post-disaster designation intended | RFP OSR §10.3.5 (p. 40) |
| **Deflection limits** | Within acceptable deflection limitations for snow, lateral, and wind loads | RFP OSR §10.3.5 (p. 40) |
