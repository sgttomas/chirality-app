# Deliverable: DEL-02-03 Structural Concept Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** The Structural Concept Narrative exists to communicate a justified, cost-effective structural engineering strategy -- encompassing framing systems, foundations, floor slabs, and expansion provisions for both a multi-use emergency/public-works building and a cold storage facility -- grounded in existing geotechnical data and coordinated with architectural, civil, and mechanical disciplines to demonstrate integrated conceptual design competence at proposal stage.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
