# Procedure — DEL-02-03: Structural Concept Narrative

---

## Purpose

This procedure guides the Structural Engineer (or Structural Design Lead) through producing the Structural Concept Narrative (DEL-02-03) as part of the Conceptual Design package (PKG-002). The narrative is evaluated under OBJ-003 (Proposed Conceptual Design, 20 pts) and demonstrates that structural engineering has been integrated with architectural, civil, mechanical, and electrical inputs to produce a coherent, cost-effective, code-compliant building concept.

The narrative supports the Design-Builder's proposal credibility by showing that a qualified structural engineer has engaged with site conditions, program requirements, Addendum 03 special requirements, and the 50/20-year design life obligations from the first day of proposal development.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Establish Structural Design Brief

**Action:**
1. Conduct a coordination session with the Architectural Lead (DEL-02-01 author) to capture:
   - Building footprint and dimensions (main building and Cold Storage)
   - Clear span requirements for apparatus bays (2,000–2,200 sf per bay per Addendum 03 §1.21)
   - Clear span requirements for PW workshop bays (2,000–2,200 sf per Addendum 03 §1.21)
   - Floor-to-ceiling heights and overhead door clearance (16 ft minimum per Addendum 03 §1.10)
   - Second-storey accommodation for shared spaces (if included; Addendum 03 §1.5)
   - Roof orientation and geometry (flat, south, west, or southwest for solar; Addendum 03 §1.17)

2. Conduct a coordination session with the Civil Engineer (DEL-02-02 author) to capture:
   - Building footprint placement on the 12-acre developable area
   - Existing site grading and proposed finished floor elevation
   - Foundation exposure (depth, groundwater, drainage requirements)
   - Bay sump drainage routing to storm system

3. Confirm with the Design Manager / PM:
   - Evaluation context (OBJ-003 = 20 pts; structural narrative is one component)
   - Proposal schedule and narrative submission milestone
   - Any value-optimization priorities for structural system selection

**Outcome:** Documented structural brief capturing all architectural, civil, and program drivers prior to system selection.

---

### Step 2 — Review Geotechnical Data and Establish Foundation Basis

**Action:**
1. Retrieve and review the 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D). Extract key parameters:
   - Soil bearing capacity (allowable bearing pressure at proposed foundation depth)
   - Seasonal high groundwater level
   - Frost depth (typical Alberta central zone: 1.5–2.0 m)
   - Settlement potential and differential settlement risk
   - Any special hazards (fill material, contamination, slope stability)

2. Document foundation design assumptions:
   - "Foundation design is based on the existing 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D). No additional geotechnical investigation is included in this proposal (DEC-013)."
   - State bearing capacity assumption, proposed foundation depth, and frost penetration basis.
   - Note: "Field verification of soil conditions at subgrade will occur during construction as standard practice under CCDC 14-2013."

3. Coordinate with Civil Engineer:
   - Confirm relationship between proposed finished floor elevation and existing grade
   - Confirm drainage approach for sump pit discharge
   - Confirm any fill/compaction requirements noted in geotech report

**Note:** If Appendix D is not retrievable, use conservative typical Penhold-area values (ASSUMPTION label required) and flag for PM to retrieve before proposal submission.

| Parameter | Basis | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Soil bearing capacity | 2021 geotech report (Appendix D) | TBD pending Appendix D retrieval |
| Groundwater level | 2021 geotech report | TBD |
| Frost depth | 2021 geotech report / NBCC climate data for Penhold | TBD |
| Foundation depth | Frost depth + bearing capacity depth | TBD |

**Outcome:** Foundation strategy established with explicit geotech reference and "no additional investigation" statement documented.

---

### Step 3 — Develop Structural System Concept

**Action:**
1. Select structural system for Main Building. Evaluate:
   - **Structural steel moment frame** (preferred ASSUMPTION): cost-effective clear spans for apparatus bays, fast construction, flexible for future expansion, integrates with mechanical/electrical routing through open-web joists.
   - **Hybrid system** (e.g., steel frame + masonry infill): possible for wall construction; check cost vs. full steel.
   - Document rationale for selection in alignment with OSR §10.3.4: "practical, cost effective, easy to maintain."

2. Select structural system for Cold Storage (60' x 100'):
   - **Post-and-frame (pole shed)** (preferred per OSR §10.3.6): most cost-effective for unheated storage; DB to provide optional alternative pricing if desired.
   - Confirm two 16' x 16' overhead door openings on opposite walls (OSR §10.3.9; person doors on each end per OSR §10.2).

3. Establish column grid:
   - Apparatus bays: typically 10–12 m (33–40 ft) clear span; column-free interior preferred for equipment maneuvering.
   - PW workshop: similar clear span requirement (2,000–2,200 sf per bay).
   - Office/shared areas: regular bay module (e.g., 6 m x 9 m / 20 ft x 30 ft) enables expansion flexibility.
   - Confirm column locations do not conflict with architectural room layouts (coordinate with DEL-02-01).

4. Verify overhead door structural support:
   - 16 ft (4.9 m) minimum clear height; 16 ft x 16 ft door openings (OSR §10.3.9).
   - Structural lintel or header beam spanning full bay width; size to resist wind, snow, and structural frame loads above opening.
   - Confirm door opening width consistent with apparatus turning radius requirements.

5. Establish slab-on-grade approach:
   - Apparatus/PW bays: concrete slab-on-grade, minimum 150 mm (6") thickness for vehicle loads; air-entrained concrete for freeze-thaw resistance; bay sumps integrated at corners with 1–2% slope toward sumps.
   - Office/shared spaces: concrete slab-on-grade, minimum 100–125 mm, standard reinforcement.
   - Cold Storage: Option 1 (compacted asphalt millings + 4' concrete strips) or Option 2 (full concrete) per OSR §10.3.8; both options should be priced. [B-004]

6. Establish concrete apron scope:
   - Aprons at all overhead door access points; designed for service vehicle weights (apparatus, graders, tandem dump trucks).
   - Apron thickness and reinforcement: ASSUMPTION minimum 200 mm (8") concrete, mesh + bar reinforcement, consistent with heavy vehicle operation.

7. Confirm solar roof structural provision:
   - Roof dead load allowance includes provision for future solar panels: add 0.2–0.3 kN/m² to roof dead load for future PV panel weight.
   - Roof framing designed for positive drainage (slope to internal drains or external gutters).

**Outcome:** Structural system selected for Main Building and Cold Storage; column grid established; door, slab, apron, and solar roof provisions defined.

---

### Step 4 — Establish Equipment Load Cases

**Action:**
1. Identify governing equipment per OSR §10.3.5:
   - **Fire apparatus bays**: Type 1 fire engines + Type 1 aerial apparatus. Assume GVW range approximately 25–40 tonnes (250–400 kN), with heavy aerial apparatus at the upper end (35–40 tonnes / 350–400 kN). [A-003 normalized: aligned with Guidance C-002 full range]
   - **PW workshop**: Graders (~15–20 tonnes), tandem dump units (~20–25 tonnes loaded), loaders (~10–15 tonnes), street sweepers (~10 tonnes), bobcats (~5 tonnes).

2. Establish floor slab design load cases:
   - Apparatus bay slab: axle loads from apparatus (ASSUMPTION: maximum single axle ~150–200 kN); 10 kN/m² distributed live load for storage/maintenance operations.
   - PW bay slab: similar to apparatus bay; driven by tandem dump units and graders.
   - Office/shared slab: standard occupancy loads per NBCC (2.4 kN/m² office, 4.8 kN/m² corridor).

3. Verify slab-on-grade thickness and reinforcement against these loads:
   - Cross-reference with geotech bearing capacity (Step 2 output).
   - Document ASSUMPTION if specific equipment weights not confirmed from Functional Program (Appendix B).

4. Establish bunker gear locker room support:
   - 40 lockers per Addendum 03 §1.13; room sized to fit 40 lockers with firefighter access.
   - Locker wall loads: ASSUMPTION approximately 10 kN total (40 lockers × ~250 kg / locker = ~10 kN — modest load, conventional wall framing adequate).
   - Structural wall at bunker gear room supports lockers; ventilation provisions (room-level, per Addendum 03 §1.14) are mechanical scope (DEL-02-04).

**Outcome:** Load cases established and documented; slab design approach verified; locker support approach confirmed.

---

### Step 5 — Address Expansion Provisions

**Action:**
1. Define structural grid modularity:
   - Use regular bay module (e.g., 6 m × 9 m / approximately 20 ft × 30 ft) for apparatus bay zone and support zone.
   - Isolated spread footings preferred over continuous strip footings — easier to add future footings adjacent to existing.
   - End bay framing (at potential expansion direction) designed with connection-ready details.

2. Identify preferred expansion directions based on architectural concept (DEL-02-01) and site plan (DEL-02-02):
   - Apparatus bay zone: extensible in primary drive-through direction or perpendicular.
   - Office/support zone: extensible consistent with site boundary and civil layout.

3. Document expansion rationale:
   - "Structural system uses a regular [X ft × Y ft] bay module with isolated spread footings, enabling future bay additions or support zone expansion at minimal marginal structural cost. No special provisions are required at existing structure to enable expansion except standard construction connections."

4. Cross-reference RFP OSR §10.2.1 (Project Success Metrics): "Facilities are designed and constructed with provisions to minimize cost and disruption of future expansion capabilities."

**Outcome:** Expansion provisions documented in concept narrative with specific grid/footing rationale.

### Step 6 — Coordinate with Other Disciplines

**Action:**
1. **Architecture (DEL-02-01):**
   - Confirm column grid does not conflict with room layouts and door placement.
   - Confirm clear span achieved for all apparatus and PW bays.
   - Confirm overhead door structural framing aligns with architectural door schedule.
   - Confirm second-storey structural approach if applicable (Addendum 03 §1.5).

2. **Civil (DEL-02-02):**
   - Confirm finished floor elevation and foundation depth relationship.
   - Confirm sump drainage routing to storm system.
   - Confirm concrete apron extent and civil interface at building perimeter.

3. **Mechanical (DEL-02-04):**
   - Confirm HVAC ductwork routing fits within structural framing depth (open-web joists recommended).
   - Confirm generator and major mechanical equipment structural support approach.
   - Confirm sump pump locations and mechanical coordination.
   - Confirm direct exhaust ventilation for fire apparatus bays — structural penetrations for exhaust duct routing.

4. **Electrical (DEL-02-05):**
   - Confirm electrical service entry and panel locations; no structural conflicts.
   - Confirm cable tray and conduit routing compatible with structural system.
   - Confirm solar-ready electrical rough-ins in roof zone do not require special structural support.

**Outcome:** Cross-discipline coordination complete; structural narrative references resolved coordination; no unresolved structural/discipline conflicts.
