# Civil Site Concept Plan — Guidance

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-02-02
**Name:** Civil Site Concept Plan
**Package:** PKG-002 — Conceptual Design
**Type:** Design / Drawings + Narrative
**Responsible Party:** Civil Engineer

---

## Purpose

The Civil Site Concept Plan is one of five discipline-level conceptual design deliverables (PKG-002) that together establish the viability of the overall Public Services Building design concept. The civil site plan's purpose is to:

1. **Demonstrate site capacity** — Show that the 12-acre developable area can accommodate the primary building, Cold Storage, parking, pavement zones, utilities, fire access, and a storm water pond within all RFP and addenda constraints
2. **Address site constraints** — Integrate findings from all reference reports: USG1123 geotechnical (topsoil/sand/clay/till, groundwater at avg 5.22 m below grade), Ghostpine wetland assessment (five features, Water Act approval required), TPN46 completed grading (building pad centre-west, drainage ditch to south), and Town of Penhold Flood Zone Map (flood fringe on east/southeast)
3. **Establish design philosophy** — Define the approach to parking layout, access routing, drainage strategy, utility tie-in, grading, and pavement that will frame detailed design decisions
4. **Enable coordination** — Provide the architectural discipline (DEL-02-01) and structural/mechanical/electrical disciplines (DEL-02-03 through DEL-02-05) with a site context and confirm that their concepts fit within the site envelope
5. **Support RFP evaluation** — Contribute to OBJ-003 (Maximize Proposed Conceptual Design score, 20 pts) by presenting a credible, constraint-responsive, operationally fit site layout

## Principles

### P-001: Constraint-Responsive Design

The site concept shall demonstrate thoughtful integration of all site constraints rather than ignoring them or deferring them to detailed design.

**Application:**
- The 8-acre flood fringe exclusion (east/southeast area per Flood Zone Map) is clearly shown on the site plan; only the 12-acre buildable area is developed
- The Ghostpine wetland assessment (Project 5646, Aug 2021) identified five wetland/waterbody features within or immediately adjacent to the subject property; the site narrative confirms Water Act approval as a construction precondition and notes the in-lieu replacement fee of $10,769.54
- Geotechnical conditions from USG1123 (Feb 2021) inform foundation approach: topsoil/sand/clay/till stratigraphy; groundwater seepage at average 5.22 m below grade; engineered fill in the building pad area (centre-west); three foundation options viable (shallow, driven pipe pile, screw pile)
- Existing site grading (TPN46, Jan 6, 2022, Issued for Construction) is referenced; the concept grading approach is consistent with TPN46 C-4 (building pad elevation ~895.43 m, drainage ditch to south, storm pond to east, access road to north)
- Existing overhead power lines on Waskasoo Ave ROW are noted; relocation may be required for access road construction

**Why it matters:** Evaluators expect the design-builder to have read all reference materials and factored constraints into the concept. A site plan that ignores Water Act implications, flood fringe limits, or groundwater depth signals inadequate due diligence and reduces evaluation score for OBJ-003.

---

### P-002: OSR Pavement Hierarchy

The site design shall implement the OSR-defined pavement hierarchy: heavy-duty asphalt for direct fire apparatus routing, light-duty asphalt for parking, suitable aggregate for heavy equipment yard areas, and concrete aprons at all overhead door access points.

**Application:**
- Heavy-duty asphalt zone routes fire apparatus directly and without interruption from apparatus bays to Waskasoo Avenue North
- Light-duty asphalt zone is applied to staff, visitor, and apparatus parking areas near the main structure
- Aggregate zone covers the remainder of the site where heavy Public Works equipment operates (graders, loaders, tandem dump units)
- Concrete aprons are installed at every overhead door access point, sized to support the weight and operation of service vehicles (fire apparatus, PW fleet); Cold Storage doors (two opposite sides) also receive concrete aprons

**Why it matters:** The OSR explicitly specifies these three surface categories (§10.3.7) and concrete aprons (§10.3.10). Departing from these specifications without a documented rationale risks non-compliance findings. The USG1123 pavement design section (§8, p.29) provides recommended pavement thicknesses for different traffic categories that should inform the detailed pavement design.

**Source:** RFP OSR §10.3.7, p.41; RFP OSR §10.3.10, p.42; USG1123 §8 (Roadway Design, p.29).

---

### P-003: Addendum 03 Integration

All special requirements from Addendum 03 shall be explicitly integrated into both the site plan drawing and the civil narrative, not deferred or mentioned only in passing.

**Application:**
- 12-acre site boundary clearly shown and annotated; 8-acre flood fringe excluded (confirmed by Flood Zone Map)
- Pickled Sand Storage explicitly absent from plan (removed per Addendum 03 §1.2)
- Bay sumps noted in apparatus bay and PW bay zones on site plan; narrative addresses sump drainage approach and coordinate with TPN46 drainage concept
- Two 2-inch minimum water fill stations located on site plan (fire apparatus bay, PW bay); conceptual water service branch from southwest corner stub shown
- Backup generator utility rough-in area designated on site plan; generator is outdoor; power service and fuel line routing shown
- Solar-capable roof orientation (flat/south/west/southwest) confirmed; building orientation in centre-west area supports south or southwest orientation
- 16 ft minimum overhead door clearance confirmed on apparatus approach routes

**Why it matters:** Addendum 03 represents late-breaking owner clarifications issued July 31, 2024. The evaluation committee will specifically check for Addendum 03 compliance as part of the conceptual design review (SOW-0010).

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.1, §1.2, §1.8, §1.10, §1.15, §1.16, §1.17.

---

### P-004: Fire Code and AHJ Compliance Path

The site concept shall establish a credible path to compliance with fire code emergency access requirements and other AHJ standards, even if exact details are deferred to detailed design.

**Application:**
- Fire apparatus bays positioned for direct emergency vehicle access and egress to Waskasoo Avenue North via heavy-duty asphalt route
- Emergency access routes shown or described with adequate width (minimum 20 ft for fire lanes per typical Fire Code; AHJ to confirm at permitting stage)
- Apparatus turn radius considered in site layout: **TBD — confirm minimum turning radius with apparatus specifications from DEL-02-01 and AHJ requirements.** Do not use the previously stated "approximately 50 ft" value as a design parameter until confirmed. The turning radius is a critical design input that varies by apparatus type (e.g., pumper, aerial, tanker) and must be verified against the specific fleet planned for this facility. [Source: RFP OSR §10.3.1, p.38 (truck turning radii); DEL-02-01 coordination required] **(B-001: ASSUMPTION tag strengthened to TBD)**
- Parking areas designed so they do not obstruct emergency routes
- Access road along north boundary per TPN46 P-1 may serve as secondary site circulation route

**Why it matters:** Fire safety is a mandatory compliance gate. A site concept that demonstrates fire code alignment from the start signals competent design leadership and reduces post-award risk.

**Source:** RFP OSR §10.3.1, p.38; RFP §7.2 (AHJ conformity requirement, p.19); TPN46 P-1.

---

### P-005: Constructability and Operations Fit

The site layout shall be pragmatic for construction sequencing and future operations, not just theoretically sound.

**Application:**
- Apparatus circulation routes are direct, unobstructed, and wide enough for fire apparatus (minimum 24 ft two-way)
- Public Works equipment yard (aggregate zone) is conveniently sized and positioned relative to PW bays
- Visitor parking is close to the main public entrance
- Staff parking is close to staff entrances
- Cold Storage placement in northwest-central area provides adequate truck approach and maneuverability
- Outdoor generator is accessible for maintenance and fueling; not blocked by other structures
- Storm pond location (east side per TPN46) does not interfere with apparatus egress or PW operations
- The access road along the north boundary (TPN46 P-1) enables construction traffic to avoid the operational apparatus routes

**Why it matters:** If the site layout creates operational conflicts, the Town's 50-year operational lifespan goal is undermined. The PSB operations committee (Kowalchuk, Ops Manager) will evaluate operational fit during RFP evaluation.

**Source:** RFP §2.2, p.8 (50-year design life); RFP OSR §10.3.4, p.39 (safe maneuverability); TPN46 P-1.

---

### P-006: Cross-Discipline Coordination

The site plan shall be explicitly coordinated with architectural (DEL-02-01), structural (DEL-02-03), mechanical (DEL-02-04), and electrical (DEL-02-05) deliverables, with cross-references documented in the narrative.

**Application:**
- Building footprint on site plan matches DEL-02-01 architectural concept (same dimensions, same orientation)
- Utility entry points (water, sewer, electrical, gas) are compatible with DEL-02-04 mechanical and DEL-02-05 electrical assumptions; utility easement along west boundary (TPN46 C-4) confirmed in site plan
- Generator location on site plan aligns with DEL-02-04 mechanical concept (outdoor diesel generator, minimum loads per Addendum 03 §1.15)
- Grading approach is consistent with TPN46 and with DEL-02-03 structural foundation approach (note: USG1123 §5.4 recommends shallow foundations or pile options; fill area in building pad must be addressed in structural design)
- Solar roof orientation assumption on site plan aligns with DEL-02-05 electrical solar-readiness provisions
- Narrative explicitly references each related deliverable by ID

**Why it matters:** Evaluators expect a coordinated design team. Inconsistencies between site plan and other discipline concepts signal siloed design and increase post-award coordination risk.

**Source:** Decomposition DEC-006 (PKG-002 discipline coordination rationale); TPN46 C-4; USG1123 §5.4.

## Considerations

### C-001: Site Layout Density versus Flexibility

**Issue:** Compact site layout maximizes buildable area and reduces infrastructure costs but reduces future expansion room; a looser layout preserves flexibility but uses more land.

**Recommendation:** Note expansion areas explicitly on the site plan in response to RFP §7.1.5 (Adaptability, Flexibility, Potential for Expansion). Use the TPN46 building pad location (centre-west) as the building zone anchor; keep the northern perimeter (adjacent to future arterial road per PCPS subdivision plan) and eastern perimeter clear for expansion potential. The PCPS Adjacent Subdivision Design (Dec 2022) designates this parcel as "Future Public Works Yard" (7.92 ha), suggesting the Town expects long-term site evolution. Narrative should articulate the expansion logic.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.5; Addendum 03 §1.1 site map; Adjacent Subdivision Design (PCPS, Dec 2022).

---

### C-002: Stormwater Management, Drainage Ditch, and Wetland Coordination

**Issue:** No on-site storm sewer (RFP OSR §11.2, p.44); TPN46 C-4 shows a completed grading design with a drainage ditch along the south boundary routing to a concrete flared outlet to Waskasoo Creek; storm pond on east side. The Ghostpine wetland assessment (Project 5646) requires that stormwater management not adversely impact wetland features; §12.3 (Stormwater Management) addresses this approach.

**Recommendation:** At concept stage, describe the stormwater approach as consistent with TPN46 grading: positive drainage from building pad via site grading, south boundary drainage ditch to concrete flared outlet, storm pond for retention. State that stormwater discharge strategy implements the Ghostpine §12.3 mitigation approach. Note that detailed stormwater sizing and BMP selection are deferred to 60% Detailed Design. Acknowledge that Water Act approval (obtained in Water Act approval process initiated by Ghostpine Project 5646) is a construction precondition.

**Source:** RFP OSR §10.3.2, p.39; RFP OSR §11.2, p.44; TPN46 C-4; Wetland Assessment (Ghostpine, Project 5646, Aug 2021), §12.3.

---

### C-003: Utility Tie-In Timing and Cost

**Issue:** Service tie-in costs are excluded from proposal pricing per Addendum 03 §1.7; a cash allowance is permitted. TPN46 C-1 confirms existing utility locations on Waskasoo Ave ROW: 200mm AC skirting sanitary line, 250mm HDPE sanitary line, existing power pole/overhead lines. Exact sizes and easement requirements are not known at proposal stage.

**Recommendation:** Narrative should clearly state the cash allowance approach for site servicing. Show approximate utility entry points on the site plan based on Addendum 03 §1.6 and TPN46 C-1 observations. Note the proposed utility easement along the west boundary (TPN46 C-4). Confirm that exact utility sizes, easements, and provider coordination are deferred to detailed design.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.6, §1.7; TPN46 C-1, C-4.

---

### C-004: Geotech and Survey Data Gaps

**Issue:** Two significant data gaps exist at proposal stage: (1) detailed survey files are provided post-award only (Addendum 03 §1.20); (2) no additional geotechnical investigation is permitted at proposal stage (DEC-013). USG1123 provides the geotechnical foundation — 18 boreholes (BH101–BH118), drilled Jan 2021, confirming topsoil/sand/clay/till stratigraphy, groundwater seepage at average 5.22 m below grade, and engineered fill in the building pad area. The USG1123 report note: "If there are any changes to the proposed developments, or their locations, these changes should be reviewed by Union Street personnel to confirm the applicability of this report to the revised development plans" (§2.2, p.2).

**Recommendation:** Narrative must explicitly acknowledge both gaps and state the assumptions used. For the geotech gap: cite USG1123 key findings (stratigraphy, groundwater depth, fill location, light-to-moderate structural loads) and note that foundation selection (shallow, driven pipe pile, or screw pile per USG1123 §5.2–5.4) will be confirmed in detailed design. For the survey gap: note that TPN46 is used as the reference basis and post-award survey will refine the layout. The narrative should also note that USG1123 may need review by Union Street if the final combined PSB footprint differs materially from the 2021 study scope (Public Works Operations Centre only).

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.20; DEC-013; USG1123 §2.2, p.2; §4.1–4.2, p.4–7; §5.2–5.4.

---

### C-005: Cold Storage Placement Strategy

**Issue:** The Cold Storage building (60 ft × 100 ft) must be positioned on the 12-acre site with adequate operational access, separation from the main building, and consideration for future expansion.

**Recommendation:** Use the Addendum 03 site map annotation ("ideal cold storage location" in the northwest-central area) as the basis for the concept placement. This annotation represents an owner preference and should be followed unless there is a compelling reason to deviate. The northwest-central placement also maximizes separation from the storm pond (east side) and avoids the engineered fill area in the building pad centre-west zone. Narrative should acknowledge this preference and justify the chosen location. Confirm that concrete aprons are provided at both Cold Storage door openings (OSR §10.3.10).

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.1 site map, p.2 (ASSUMPTION: best-effort interpretation); TPN46 C-2 (building pad centre-west, pond east); RFP OSR §10.3.10.

---

### C-007: Overhead Power Line Relocation Decision Criteria (B-003)

**Issue:** TPN46 C-1 notes existing overhead power lines along the Waskasoo Ave ROW (west boundary). The Datasheet and Guidance P-001 mention these lines and note that relocation "may be required" for access road construction, but no decision criteria are provided for when relocation is necessary versus avoidable. This is a cost and schedule risk with no current decision guidance.

**Recommendation:** The civil narrative should include a decision framework for overhead power line relocation:

1. **Relocation is required when:** The access road alignment or site access point from Waskasoo Ave conflicts with overhead line clearance zones; construction equipment (cranes, excavators) cannot maintain safe working distances from energized lines during site works; the 16 ft minimum overhead door clearance requirement (Addendum 03 §1.10) for apparatus approach routes is compromised by overhead line sag.
2. **Relocation may be avoidable when:** The access road alignment can be adjusted to maintain clearance from existing pole locations; underground service conversion eliminates overhead lines as part of the electrical service entry design (coordinate with DEL-02-05).
3. **Decision triggers:** Engage the electrical utility provider (post-award, Procedure B4) to confirm clearance requirements and relocation cost/timeline. Track as a risk item in DEL-10-01.

**ASSUMPTION:** Relocation feasibility and cost are not known at concept stage. The concept plan should note the overhead lines as a constraint and flag the relocation decision as TBD pending utility provider consultation.

**Source:** TPN46 C-1 (Existing Site Conditions — overhead power lines on Waskasoo Ave ROW); Addendum 03 §1.10 (16 ft overhead door clearance); Procedure.md Step B4 (Utility Provider Agreements).

---

### C-009: Phase A Step Dependencies and Priority (D-001)

**Issue:** Procedure Phase A steps A1 through A6 are presented in sequential order, but the critical-path dependencies between steps are not explicit. A civil engineer new to the project cannot determine which steps block others and which may proceed concurrently.

**Recommendation:** The following dependency guidance applies to Phase A:

| Step | Dependencies | Concurrency Potential |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** (Reference review) | None -- can begin immediately | Can run concurrently with A2 (architect coordination initiation) |
| **A2** (Footprint coordination) | Requires architect to provide footprint from DEL-02-01; initiating the request can happen concurrently with A1 | Waiting for architect response is typically the longest lead time; initiate early |
| **A3** (Grading and drainage) | Depends on A1 (reference data extracted, especially TPN46 and USG1123) | Can begin once A1 is substantially complete; does not require A2 completion |
| **A4** (Site layout) | **Critical dependency:** Requires A2 (building footprint) and A3 (grading strategy) to be complete; this is typically the critical-path step | Cannot begin until A2 and A3 are complete |
| **A5** (Utilities) | Depends on A4 (building placement determines utility routing) | Can begin concurrently with late A4 work once building placement is fixed |
| **A6** (Drawing + narrative production) | Depends on A4 and A5 completion; integrates all prior steps | Final step; cannot begin until all design decisions from A4 and A5 are resolved |

**Critical path:** A2 (architect coordination) is typically the pacing item because it depends on an external deliverable (DEL-02-01). Start A1 and A2 initiation simultaneously to minimize schedule risk. A3 can proceed in parallel with A2 once reference documents are reviewed. A4 is the integration step where all inputs converge.

**ASSUMPTION:** This dependency analysis is based on the logical relationships between steps; actual project schedule and team availability may allow further parallelism or impose additional constraints.

**Source:** Procedure.md Steps A1 through A6; DEL-02-01 coordination dependency.

---

### C-006: Water Act Approval Path and Timeline

**Issue:** The Ghostpine Wetland Assessment (Project 5646, Aug 2021) was prepared as an Application for Approval under the Alberta Water Act, identifying five wetland/waterbody features. The in-lieu replacement fee of $10,769.54 is triggered upon Water Act approval. The approval process with Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP) takes time and is a critical-path item before site works can commence.

**Recommendation:** The civil site narrative should flag Water Act approval as a construction precondition and note that the Ghostpine assessment (Project 5646) was specifically prepared for this purpose. The proposal risk register (DEL-10-01) should capture Water Act approval timing as a site risk. The Design-Build team should plan to re-engage Ghostpine or equivalent environmental firm early post-award to initiate or confirm AEP approval status. Note that the in-lieu fee is a known cost and should be tracked.

**Source:** Wetland Assessment (Ghostpine Environmental Services Ltd., Project 5646, Aug 11, 2021), Executive Summary; Title: "Application for Approval under the Water Act."

---

### C-008: OBJ-003 Scoring Criteria Linkage (C-002)

**Issue:** The civil site concept plan contributes to OBJ-003 (Maximize Proposed Conceptual Design score, 20 pts) as part of the PKG-002 discipline package. Guidance Purpose section 5 mentions OBJ-003 but no document explicitly maps specific site plan elements to evaluation scoring weight. Without this linkage, the team cannot verify which elements carry the most evaluation weight or prioritize effort accordingly.

**Recommendation:** The following site plan elements are most likely to carry evaluation weight under OBJ-003, based on the RFP evaluation criteria (RFP §7.1.1) and the scope of the civil site concept:

| Site Plan Element | Likely Evaluation Weight Rationale | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Building placement and orientation | Demonstrates understanding of site constraints and solar orientation | RFP §7.1.1; Addendum 03 §1.17 |
| Parking layout completeness | Shows functional capacity for staff, visitor, apparatus | RFP OSR Appendix B |
| Fire access route credibility | Demonstrates safety compliance awareness | RFP OSR §10.3.1; Alberta Fire Code |
| Pavement zone differentiation | Shows attention to OSR-specific requirements | RFP OSR §10.3.7 |
| Addendum 03 compliance completeness | Demonstrates thorough reading of addenda | Addendum 03 (all sections); SOW-0010 |
| Site constraints narrative quality | Demonstrates due diligence with reference reports | RFP §7.1.1 (narrative requirement) |
| Cross-discipline coordination evidence | Demonstrates integrated team approach | RFP §7.1.1 (implied) |

**ASSUMPTION:** Specific scoring rubric details for OBJ-003 are not available in the RFP; the above mapping is a best-effort interpretation. The evaluation committee's weighting within the 20-point allocation is not disclosed.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.1 (Proposed Conceptual Design); Decomposition OBJ-003 mapping (PKG-002 deliverables).

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Access Point Count — Single versus Dual Entry

**Trade-off:** A single access point from Waskasoo Avenue North simplifies design and reduces municipal tie-in complexity, but concentrates traffic and limits operational flexibility. Dual access points improve separation of apparatus, staff, and visitor traffic but add cost and intersection design complexity.

**Considerations:**
- Fire apparatus must access Waskasoo Avenue directly and without delay; a dedicated heavy-duty asphalt approach route supports this
- Staff/visitor traffic separation from apparatus traffic is a safety and operational best practice
- The TPN46 access road design (P-1) shows a single access road entry from Waskasoo Ave along the north boundary; this is a reference design only and the concept may vary
- AHJ may have specific requirements on access point design (intersection sight lines, turn lanes)
- The PCPS subdivision plan shows planned arterial road to north — future access from that direction may be possible but is outside this proposal scope

**Resolution approach:** Concept plan should show the proposed access configuration; narrative should justify the choice and note that AHJ intersection design requirements will be confirmed in the permitting phase.

**Source:** TPN46 P-1; Adjacent Subdivision Design (PCPS, Dec 2022).

---

### T-002: Storm Pond Sizing — Integration with Flood Fringe or Standalone Retention

**Trade-off:** The TPN46 design shows a storm pond on the east portion of the site (cut area). A larger pond reduces peak discharge more effectively but consumes more buildable area; a smaller pond simplifies construction but may not achieve the required attenuation. Integration with the flood fringe area is not appropriate (building construction not permitted in flood fringe per Addendum 03 §1.1).

**Considerations:**
- No storm sewer on site (RFP OSR §11.2); off-site discharge must be managed
- Flood fringe proximity and Ghostpine wetland assessment require careful stormwater routing
- TPN46 C-4 shows drainage ditch along south boundary routing to concrete flared outlet to Waskasoo Creek
- Wetland stormwater management approach (Ghostpine §12.3) must be integrated

**Resolution approach:** At concept stage, describe the storm pond approach as shown in TPN46 with a drainage ditch to south. Note that detailed stormwater sizing and BMP selection are deferred to 60% Detailed Design phase, subject to Water Act approval conditions.

**Source:** TPN46 C-2, C-4; RFP OSR §11.2, p.44; Wetland Assessment (Ghostpine, Project 5646), §12.3.

---

### T-003: Pavement Surface for Yard Area — Aggregate versus Asphalt

**Trade-off:** OSR §10.3.7 specifies "suitable aggregate" for the heavy equipment area, which is lower cost and more repair-friendly for heavy PW equipment. However, aggregate generates dust and tracking and may create maintenance issues near building entrances.

**Considerations:**
- OSR §10.3.7 is explicit: aggregate is the specified material for the equipment yard
- USG1123 §8 (Roadway Design) provides aggregate and pavement structural design guidance; aggregate subgrade conditions and traffic categories are addressed in Tables 8.1 and 8.2
- Concrete aprons at overhead door access points (OSR §10.3.10) provide a clean transition surface between aggregate and building entries

**Resolution approach:** Follow OSR §10.3.7 specification; note the aggregate/asphalt transition approach in the narrative; reference USG1123 §8 for subgrade conditions that will inform detailed aggregate design.

**Source:** RFP OSR §10.3.7, p.41; USG1123 §8, p.29.

## Examples

### EX-001: Effective Addendum 03 Compliance Section in Narrative

**Good Example:**
> "The site concept integrates all Addendum 03 site-relevant requirements. The 12-acre developable boundary is shown on the site plan; the 8-acre flood fringe (storm pond and dog park zone on east/southeast portion of the 20-acre parcel, confirmed by Town of Penhold Flood Zone Map) is depicted as context. The Pickled Sand Storage building does not appear on the site plan, consistent with Addendum 03 §1.2 removal.
>
> Bay sumps are indicated in the apparatus bay and PW bay zones on the site plan (symbol 'S'); narrative confirms sump drainage is coordinated with the structural design (DEL-02-03) and mechanical layout (DEL-02-04). The two 2-inch minimum water fill stations (one fire apparatus bay, one PW bay) are located per Addendum 03 §1.16; a conceptual water service branch route from the water main stub at the southwest corner is shown.
>
> The outdoor backup generator utility rough-in area is designated on the site plan adjacent to the main building exterior; power service and fuel line routing are coordinated with the mechanical and electrical disciplines (DEL-02-04 and DEL-02-05). Solar-capable roof orientation is confirmed as south-facing based on building orientation shown in centre-west area; this aligns with Addendum 03 §1.17 (flat/south/west/southwest acceptable orientations)."

**Why it works:** Each Addendum 03 item is named, its location or treatment is described, and cross-references to related deliverables are provided. Source citations are specific. Evaluators can confirm compliance without guessing.

---

### EX-002: Effective Site Constraints Narrative Section

**Good Example:**
> "The site concept integrates findings from four reference documents. The 2021 Geotechnical Investigation (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., USG1123, Feb 12, 2021) drilled 18 boreholes across the site on January 27–28, 2021. General stratigraphy in the main site boreholes (BH101–BH116) is, in descending order: topsoil (avg 72 mm), sand, clay, and till. Groundwater seepage was observed at an average depth of 5.22 m below grade in 8 boreholes. Engineered fill is present in the building pad area (centre-west site). Foundation options include shallow foundations, driven steel pipe piles, and screw piles; the appropriate system will be confirmed in detailed design per DEC-013. No additional geotechnical investigation is included in this proposal.
>
> The Wetland Assessment and Impact Report (Ghostpine Environmental Services Ltd., Project No. 5646, August 11, 2021) was prepared as an Application for Approval under the Alberta Water Act. Five wetland/waterbody features were identified: one temporary marsh, one seasonal marsh, two ephemeral drainages, and one ephemeral waterbody. Water Act approval from Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP) is required before site works commence; an in-lieu replacement fee of $10,769.54 applies to the marsh features per the Alberta Wetland Policy. Water Act approval is identified as a critical precondition for construction and will be tracked in the project risk register (DEL-10-01).
>
> The completed lot grading design (Tagish Engineering, TPN46, issued for construction January 6, 2022) shows the building pad in the centre-west area at approximately 895.43 m elevation, with a drainage ditch along the south boundary routing to a concrete flared outlet to Waskasoo Creek, and a storm water pond in the east portion of the site. The site concept plan is consistent with this reference grading design. Post-award survey files will refine the layout per Addendum 03 §1.20.
>
> The Town of Penhold Flood Zone Map confirms the 100-year flood fringe covers the east and southeast portions of the 20-acre parcel along the Waskasoo Creek corridor. The 12-acre buildable area (west portion) is outside the flood fringe. All buildings, pavement, and infrastructure are confined to the 12-acre area."

**Why it works:** Each report is cited by name, author, date, and reference number. Specific findings (borehole count, groundwater depth, stratigraphy, wetland feature types, fee amount, building pad elevation) are described with quantitative detail. Design implications are drawn. Deferred items are explicitly noted.

| Item | Reason for Deferral |
|---|---|
| Exact utility sizes and routing | Confirmed during detailed MEP design and utility provider coordination |
| Final grading contours and cut/fill volumes | Requires post-award survey data (Addendum 03 §1.20); TPN46 is reference basis |
| Stormwater facility sizing (storm pond and drainage ditch) | Engineered stormwater design in detailed design phase, subject to Water Act approval conditions |
| Traffic access intersection treatment | Requires AHJ review; pre-permit meeting in design phase |
| Accessible parking and path details | Confirmed in detailed design per Alberta Building Code |
| Fire access certification drawing | Prepared for AHJ approval during design phase permitting |
| Utility easement coordination with Town | Service provider and municipal coordination in design phase |
| Water Act approval timing | Obtained post-award; Ghostpine Project 5646 initiates the process |
| Foundation system selection | Confirmed in detailed design from USG1123 options (shallow/driven pile/screw pile) |
| USG1123 applicability review for revised building scope | Structural engineer to review if combined PSB footprint materially differs from 2021 study scope |

### Assumptions (must be stated explicitly in narrative)

| Assumption | Basis |
|---|---|
| Site plan based on TPN46 reference grading drawings and Appendix F subdivision plan | Post-award survey files will refine the layout (Addendum 03 §1.20) |
| Foundation design based on 2021 USG1123 report only | No additional investigation per DEC-013; options: shallow, driven pipe pile, or screw pile |
| Building pad in centre-west area at approximately 895.43 m elevation | ASSUMPTION: read from TPN46 C-4 Design Grade Plan |
| Utility connection points: water/wastewater at southwest corner, electrical/communications/gas at west boundary | Per Addendum 03 §1.6 and TPN46 C-1 existing conditions |
| Generator is outdoor diesel type | Per RFP Appendix B line 30.0 (outdoor area) and Addendum 03 §1.15 context |
| Cold Storage placement in northwest-central area of 12-acre site | ASSUMPTION: based on Addendum 03 §1.1 site map annotation "ideal cold storage location" |
| Solar orientation: building faces south or southwest | Per Addendum 03 §1.17; building pad placement in centre-west area supports this orientation |
| Water Act approval to be obtained post-award | Ghostpine Project 5646 was prepared for this purpose; in-lieu fee $10,769.54 identified |
