# Civil Site Concept Plan — Procedure

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-02-02
**Name:** Civil Site Concept Plan
**Package:** PKG-002 — Conceptual Design
**Type:** Design / Drawings + Narrative
**Responsible Party:** Civil Engineer

---

## Purpose

This procedure defines how the Civil Site Concept Plan is produced during the RFP proposal phase and how site design decisions are implemented, permitted, and verified during detailed design and construction. The procedure serves three contexts:

1. **Proposal Production (Current Phase, Steps A1–A6):** Steps for the civil engineer to develop the site concept plan drawing and civil narrative from RFP requirements, reference documents (USG1123, TPN46, Ghostpine 5646, Flood Zone Map), and architectural coordination inputs.
2. **Detailed Design and Construction (Post-Award, Steps B1–B5 and C1–C4):** Steps for refining the concept into permit-ready documents, implementing construction, and verifying site work.
3. **Environmental and Regulatory** (referenced throughout): Water Act approval is a pre-construction obligation initiated by Ghostpine Project 5646.

## Steps

### PHASE A — PROPOSAL PRODUCTION

#### A1: Review Reference Documents and Extract Key Data

**Action:**
1. Confirm all reference documents are accessible; log any gaps to project manager.
2. Extract and record from each reference document:

**From USG1123 (Geotechnical, Feb 12, 2021):**
   - Stratigraphy: topsoil (avg 72 mm) → sand → clay → till in BH101–BH116; till extends to max depth in BH101–BH108; clay extends to max depth in BH109–BH116
   - Groundwater: seepage in 8 boreholes at average depth of 5.22 m below grade; sloughing in 7 of 8 deeper boreholes
   - Fill area: engineered fill present in building pad zone (centre-west per TPN46 cross-reference)
   - Foundation options identified: shallow foundations (§5.4), driven steel pipe piles (§5.2), screw piles (§5.3)
   - Pavement design: Table 8.1 and 8.2 provide recommended pavement thicknesses by traffic category
   - Cement type recommendation in §4.3 (sulphate attack assessment)
   - Note §2.2 caution: if development changes materially, review by Union Street recommended

**From TPN46 (Site Grading, Tagish Engineering, Jan 6, 2022):**
   - C-1: Existing contours, fence lines, overhead power lines on Waskasoo Ave ROW, trees to be removed, existing sanitary and sewer lines on Waskasoo Ave, borehole locations
   - C-2: Future Building placement (centre-west), proposed storm pond (east), proposed access road (north boundary)
   - C-4: Design grades — building pad ~895.43 m, drainage ditch along south boundary, concrete flared outlet to Waskasoo Creek, utility easement along west boundary
   - P-1: Access road plan/profile from Waskasoo Ave

**From Ghostpine Project 5646 (Wetland Assessment, Aug 11, 2021):**
   - Five features requiring Water Act attention: 1 temporary marsh + 1 seasonal marsh + 2 ephemeral drainages + 1 ephemeral waterbody
   - Water Act approval from AEP is a construction precondition
   - In-lieu replacement fee: $10,769.54 (for temporary and seasonal marsh only; ephemeral features not subject to replacement per Alberta Wetland Policy)
   - Stormwater management approach in §12.3 must be reflected in drainage design

**From Flood Zone Map (Town of Penhold):**
   - 100-year floodway and flood fringe cover east/southeast portion of parcel along Waskasoo Creek corridor
   - West ~12 acres (Waskasoo Ave side) is outside flood fringe and confirmed as buildable

**From Appendix B (Functional Program):** Extract parking quantities for staff, visitor, and apparatus.
**From Addendum 03 site map:** Ideal Cold Storage location (northwest-central), ideal stockpile location (north-central), proposed heavy-duty asphalt area (southwest), engineered fill area.

3. Summarize all key data in a design input table in the project file.

**Verification:** All documents reviewed; key data extracted and summarized; gaps documented.

---

#### A2: Coordinate with Architect to Obtain Building Footprint

**Action:**
1. Obtain from DEL-02-01 (Architect):
   - Overall building footprint dimensions (length × width)
   - Building orientation (rotation from north; confirm south or southwest for solar-capable roof per Addendum 03 §1.17)
   - Primary public entrance location
   - Apparatus bay exit locations and door widths (16 ft minimum per Addendum 03 §1.10)
   - Staff entrance and service entrance locations
   - Approximate sump locations within apparatus and PW bays (for site drainage coordination)
2. Confirm footprint fits within 12-acre site:
   - 12 acres = approximately 522,720 sf total
   - Main building footprint + Cold Storage (6,000 sf) + storm pond (east side per TPN46) + parking + drive aisles + utilities + yard must fit within 522,720 sf
   - Building pad available area (centre-west) confirmed from TPN46 C-2
3. Agree on site coordinate reference for plan alignment; note TPN46 uses NW6 37-27-4 coordinate system
4. Schedule a review check-in with architect before finalizing site plan (end of Step A4)

**Verification:** Footprint dimensions and orientation confirmed; feasibility calculation demonstrates adequate site area; solar orientation confirmed.

---

#### A3: Establish Grading and Drainage Strategy

**Action:**
1. Review TPN46 grading drawings to understand the completed lot grading:
   - C-1: Existing contours slope gently east toward Waskasoo Creek (topography confirmed; USG1123 §2.1 notes site "generally flat with minor grades sloping east")
   - C-4: Building pad graded to ~895.43 m; drainage ditch along south boundary; storm pond on east; drainage routes to concrete flared outlet at south end
2. Review USG1123 §4.2 (groundwater at avg 5.22 m) and §5.1 (site grading and earthworks recommendations) for earthworks context; note §5.1.2 drainage recommendations
3. Confirm grading approach for concept plan:
   - Accept TPN46 grading as the reference basis; concept plan grading is consistent with C-4
   - Positive drainage away from all buildings (RFP OSR §10.3.2)
   - South boundary drainage ditch routes to concrete flared outlet per TPN46 D-1
   - Storm pond on east side provides retention before discharge to Waskasoo Creek
4. Review Ghostpine §12.3 (Stormwater Management) to confirm that the drainage approach does not adversely impact wetland features; note any specific restrictions
5. Note that finish grade must maintain separation from flood fringe elevation; TPN46 design grades provide this confirmation
6. **(A-004) Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) concept note:** At concept stage, identify the ESC approach for the grading and drainage strategy. Note that the site grading will disturb soil over the 12-acre area and that ESC measures (silt fence, sediment traps, temporary swales, construction entrance) will be required during construction. The concept narrative should acknowledge ESC as a design consideration coordinated with the drainage strategy and consistent with Ghostpine §12.3 stormwater management to avoid adverse wetland impacts. Detailed ESC design is deferred to Phase B (B3 step 1). [Source: Ghostpine Project 5646, §12.3; Alberta Erosion and Sediment Control guidelines (location TBD)]

**Verification:** Grading approach consistent with TPN46 C-4 and USG1123 §5.1; stormwater approach consistent with Ghostpine §12.3; ESC concept acknowledged; documented in project design notes.

3. Develop pavement zones per OSR §10.3.7 and §10.3.10:
   - **Heavy-duty asphalt zone:** Direct route from apparatus bay exits to Waskasoo Avenue North; minimum 24 ft width two-way; southwest area per Addendum 03 site map annotation
   - **Light-duty asphalt zone:** Staff parking, visitor parking, and apparatus parking adjacent to main structure
   - **Aggregate zone:** Heavy equipment operations area (PW yard), equipment storage, stockpile area (north-central per Addendum 03 site map)
   - **Concrete aprons:** At every overhead door access point (main building apparatus bays, PW bays, Cold Storage both doors); sized for service vehicle weight
4. Lay out parking per Functional Program (Appendix B) quantities:
   - Staff parking near staff entrances
   - Visitor parking near main public entrance
   - Apparatus apron area adjacent to apparatus bays
   - Accessible parking integrated into parking areas with accessible route to building entrance
5. Draw internal circulation — drive aisles (24 ft two-way, 16 ft one-way), fire apparatus turn areas, Cold Storage truck approach
6. Show fire access route (minimum 20 ft width) providing adequate coverage of building perimeter per Alberta Fire Code; AHJ confirmation deferred to permitting
7. Locate generator area adjacent to main building exterior; show rough utility service path to building; note outdoor placement
