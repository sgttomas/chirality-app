# Deliverable: DEL-02-02 Civil Site Concept Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** The Civil Site Concept Plan establishes the spatial arrangement and infrastructure strategy for a constrained developable site, translating geotechnical, environmental, regulatory, and programmatic inputs into a coherent layout that demonstrates buildability, operational fitness, and compliance across civil engineering disciplines. It must carry knowledge of how site constraints, access requirements, drainage strategy, pavement hierarchy, utility coordination, and regulatory preconditions integrate into a single defensible concept that frames all downstream detailed design.

## Audit

All 72 cells across matrices C, F, D, K, X, and E were checked for:

1. **Algebra leak** (contains intersection or Sigma symbols): PASS — no cells contain these symbols
2. **Uninterpreted expansion** (exceeds ~80 characters): PASS — longest cell value is "absolute regulatory coverage" (27 characters)
3. **Operator leak** (contains + flanked by semantic terms): PASS — no cells contain the addition operator

No cells required re-derivation.
