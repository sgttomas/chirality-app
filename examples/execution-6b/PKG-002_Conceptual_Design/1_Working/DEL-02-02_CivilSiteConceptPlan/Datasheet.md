## Summary

The Civil Site Concept Plan establishes the foundational layout for the 12-acre developable site of the Penhold PSB, building on completed reference documents. Key geotechnical facts from USG1123: general stratigraphy is topsoil/sand/clay/till; groundwater seepage at average 5.22 m below grade; shallow foundations, driven pipe piles, or screw piles are all viable options. The completed Tagish Engineering site grading (TPN46) places the building pad in the centre-west area at approximately 895.43 m elevation, with storm pond in the east (cut), drainage ditch to the south, and access road to the north. The Ghostpine wetland assessment (Project 5646) identified five wetland/waterbody features requiring Water Act approval; an in-lieu fee of $10,769.54 applies. The flood zone map confirms the 8-acre flood fringe is on the east/southeast, leaving the west 12 acres buildable. All Addendum 03 requirements — bay sumps, 2-inch fill stations, 16 ft overhead door clearance, generator placement, solar-capable roof orientation, and removal of pickled sand storage — must be explicitly integrated in both drawing and narrative. Survey files are provided post-award.
