The Civil Site Concept Plan demonstrates a functional, compliant site layout for the 12-acre developable portion of the Penhold Public Services Building project. It includes:

1. **Site plan drawing(s)** showing building placement, parking layout, access and circulation, pavement zones, drainage concept, Cold Storage placement, utility connection points, and fire access routes
2. **Civil site narrative** addressing site constraints from all reference reports (USG1123 geotechnical, Ghostpine wetland assessment, environmental assessment, TPN46 site grading, flood zone), design strategy, pavement approach, utility coordination, and RFP/addenda compliance
3. **Coordination** with architectural (DEL-02-01), structural (DEL-02-03), mechanical (DEL-02-04), and electrical (DEL-02-05) concept deliverables

### What This Deliverable Excludes

- Detailed civil design, calculations, or technical specifications (reserved for detailed design phase)
- Final survey data or certified survey (survey files to be provided post-award per Addendum 03 §1.20)
- Construction staging or sequencing (reserved for Construction Methodology, DEL-07-01)
- Detailed stormwater facility sizing (sizing, outlet structures, inflow/outflow calculations — deferred to detailed design)
- Detailed utility system design (water, sanitary, electrical distribution — deferred to detailed design)
- Water Act approval process and supporting submissions (this is a construction precondition; referenced in narrative but not produced here)
- Site servicing costs in proposal pricing (cash allowance permitted per Addendum 03 §1.7)
- Pickled Sand Storage building — removed from this RFP per Addendum 03 §1.2

   - **Drawing scale (X-001):** Recommended 1 in = 50 ft or 1 in = 60 ft for 11" x 17" format; scale shall be sufficient to clearly show all required site plan elements (building footprints, parking layout, pavement zones, utility routing, fire access routes) at legible resolution. Scale bar and ratio shall be shown on drawing. [Source: Procedure.md Step A6, Drawing Production step 1; normalized here as the authoritative scale specification]
   - Content: 12-acre site boundary, flood fringe context (8-acre east portion), building footprints (dimensioned), Cold Storage (dimensioned), parking layout, pavement zones (heavy-duty / light-duty / aggregate), concrete aprons, utilities (with utility easement along west boundary), drainage concept (drainage ditch to south, storm pond to east), fire access routes, sump locations, fill station locations, generator rough-in area, expansion areas, north arrow, legend

2. **Civil Site Narrative (Markdown or PDF)**
   - **Length guidance (D-002):** Target length is approximately 2-4 pages given the scope of content required (10+ narrative sections listed in Procedure A6). The previous 1-3 page estimate is replaced with this range to better reflect the number of topics to be addressed: Site Constraints Summary, Grading and Drainage Strategy, Access and Circulation, Pavement Strategy, Utility Connection Approach, Water Act and Wetland Compliance Summary, Addendum 03 Compliance Summary, Design Coordination Notes, Survey and Geotech Basis Statements, and Future Expansion Provisions. Content quality and completeness take priority over page count. [Source: Procedure.md Step A6, Narrative Production]
   - Sections: Site Constraints Summary (citing USG1123, Ghostpine 5646, TPN46, Flood Zone Map); Grading and Drainage Strategy; Access and Circulation; Pavement Strategy; Utility Connection Approach; Water Act and Wetland Compliance Summary; Addendum 03 Compliance Summary; Future Expansion Provisions; Design Coordination Notes; Survey and Geotech Basis Statements
   - All non-trivial assertions cite source documents by reference, section, and page

3. **Compliance Statement (F-001)**
   - The site concept plan drawing and/or narrative shall include a compliance attestation note confirming that the deliverable has been prepared in accordance with RFP 2024_004 and Addendum 03 requirements. Example: "This Civil Site Concept Plan has been prepared in accordance with RFP 2024_004 (Jul 10, 2024) and Addendum 03 (Jul 31, 2024)." This provides a certified compliance mechanism for regulatory audit purposes. [Source: Specification.md Documentation section; RFP 2024_004; Addendum 03]

4. **Cross-Reference Checklist (internal QA)**
   - Confirms DEL-02-01, DEL-02-03, DEL-02-04, DEL-02-05 coordination
   - Verifies all R-01 through R-19 requirements addressed
   - Documents any TBDs for detailed design

### Deliverable Status Context

- **At Proposal Submission:** Concept-level design; suitable for RFP response and evaluation (OBJ-003)
- **Pre-Construction Precondition:** Water Act approval required before site works commence (Ghostpine Project 5646 initiates this process; approval to be obtained post-award)
- **Next Phase:** Detailed design phase incorporates post-award survey data, engineered grading calculations, utility sizing, stormwater facility design, AHJ permit drawings, and confirmation of Water Act approval

## Summary

The Civil Site Concept Plan Specification defines 19 requirements spanning site boundary, building placement, parking, pavement zones, drainage, utilities, fire access, Water Act compliance, and narrative obligations. The specification is enriched by four accessible reference documents: USG1123 (18-borehole geotechnical investigation confirming topsoil/sand/clay/till stratigraphy and groundwater at avg 5.22 m), TPN46 (completed lot grading with building pad at centre-west ~895.43 m elevation and drainage ditch to south), Ghostpine Project 5646 (Water Act approval required; in-lieu fee $10,769.54 for wetland impacts), and the Town of Penhold Flood Zone Map (flood fringe on east/southeast portion confirmed). All Addendum 03 site-relevant requirements must be explicitly addressed in both drawing and narrative. The civil engineer must also demonstrate cross-discipline coordination with the architectural, structural, mechanical, and electrical concept deliverables.
