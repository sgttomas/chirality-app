# Mechanical Concept Narrative — Guidance

**Deliverable ID:** DEL-02-04
**Package:** PKG-002 — Conceptual Design
**Type:** Design Guidance (Directional)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-17

---

## Purpose

The Mechanical Concept Narrative serves to:

1. **Demonstrate Design Competence** — Show that the mechanical engineering team understands the Town's operational requirements for a combined fire hall and public works facility, particularly the specialized systems (direct apparatus exhaust, emergency power, water fill stations, bay sumps, decontamination plumbing, SCBA room climate control) mandated by Addendum 03 and the Functional Program.

2. **Frame the Mechanical Design Direction** — Establish a clear conceptual approach to all major mechanical systems (HVAC, ventilation, plumbing, generator, fire protection) that will guide detailed design development. This is a scaffolding document setting the stage for 60% and 100% IFC design phases.

3. **Demonstrate Compliance with All Addendum 03 Clarifications** — Explicitly embed all addendum mechanical requirements into the concept narrative so evaluators see that the design team has read and actioned every clarification (apparatus bay exhaust, bunker gear room ventilation, water fill stations, bay sumps, backup generator scope, room sizing).

4. **Support OBJ-003 (Proposed Conceptual Design Score, 20 pts)** — The mechanical narrative is one of five discipline narratives supporting the highest-weighted technical evaluation criterion. A credible, thorough, and operations-aware narrative contributes directly to the overall concept score.

5. **Establish Cross-Discipline Coordination Principles** — Show how mechanical systems integrate with architectural layout, structural slab design, generator electrical connection, civil site drainage, and the sustainability and maintainability narratives (DEL-04-02, DEL-05-03).

## Principles

### Principle P-001: Operational Fit is the Primary Design Driver

**Statement:** The Public Services Building exists to serve fire department and public works operations. Mechanical systems must be designed for operational reality, not just code minimum compliance.

**Rationale:** Fire departments operate 24/7 with equipment demands that standard commercial buildings do not have. Apparatus bay exhaust, emergency generator power, water fill stations, bay sumps, decontamination facilities, and SCBA climate control are essential operational infrastructure. A design that technically meets code but frustrates operations fails the Owner's purpose.

**Design Implications:**
- Apparatus bay exhaust must be responsive to actual usage patterns (activates when apparatus is in bay; removes diesel exhaust and particulates).
- Generator capacity must match true emergency loads — Addendum 03 §1.15 specifies kitchen, ICP/meeting room, and 2 bathrooms as minimums; bay door secondary opening is also required.
- Water fill stations must be at ground level where fire crews actually use them (Addendum 03 §1.16 explicit: ground level, 2" minimum).
- Bunker gear room ventilation addresses real moisture and odor concerns that protect expensive gear and firefighter health.
- Decontamination room and showers provide firefighters with an appropriate cleanup path; hot water reliability is critical.
- SCBA room temperature control protects life safety equipment that must be ready at all times.

**Sources:** Addendum 03 §1.8, §1.11, §1.12, §1.14, §1.15, §1.16, §1.21; RFP §11.1.1.

---

### Principle P-002: Cold Climate Design Discipline

**Statement:** Every mechanical decision must account for Penhold, Alberta's cold climate — freeze protection, high heating loads, and winter operational resilience are foundational, not optional.

**Rationale:** Standard commercial mechanical design norms, developed for temperate climates, will fail in Penhold if applied without cold climate adaptation. Outdoor hose bibs freeze unless trace-heated. Fire protection piping in apparatus bays freezes unless protected. Generator fuel systems and cooling circuits require cold-weather specification.

**Design Implications:**
- Water piping in exterior walls, attic spaces, or unheated zones must be traced or relocated.
- Sump pit discharge lines must be protected from freeze-up (insulation, trace heat, or gravity-drain configuration).
- Generator cooling and fuel lines must be specified for cold climate operation.
- HVAC makeup air for apparatus bay exhaust must address winter air introduction (louver freeze-up prevention).
- Wet sprinkler system viability in apparatus bays depends on whether bay thermal conditioning can reliably prevent freezing.
- SCBA room minimum temperature must be maintained through winter to protect cylinder storage requirements.

**Sources:** Alberta Building Code (ASSUMPTION: applicable); Addendum 03 §1.6 (site utility context); RFP §2.2 (Penhold geography).

### Principle P-003: Energy Efficiency Within Operational Constraints

**Statement:** The RFP emphasizes energy efficiency and sustainability (OBJ-004) and practical, energy-efficient design (RFP §10.3.4). High-efficiency mechanical systems must be specified as defaults, provided they do not compromise operational requirements or safety.

**Rationale:** Modern condensing boilers, heat pumps, ERV/HRV systems, and demand-controlled ventilation are both energy-efficient and cost-effective over the 50-year building life. There is no real trade-off — better technology is cheaper to operate AND more sustainable. The only qualification is that efficiency cannot compromise operational function.

**Design Implications:**
- HVAC systems should default to high-efficiency equipment (condensing boiler, heat pump, ERV/HRV) unless cost-benefit analysis justifies a different approach.
- Energy recovery in ventilation is especially valuable in the cold climate (heat recovery from exhaust air) and should be standard for office and residential zones.
- Building envelope thermal performance (insulation, air sealing) is the first energy efficiency priority; system efficiency is second.
- Solar-ready roof provisions (Addendum 03 §1.17) should be accommodated structurally and electrically; mechanical to provide roof clearance and rough-in space for future solar thermal if desired.

**Sources:** Addendum 03 §1.17 (solar-capable roof); RFP OBJ-004; RFP §10.3.4 (practical, energy efficient, cost effective, easy to maintain); RFP §7.1.4 (durability and ease of maintenance).

**OBJ-004 Scoring Linkage (Lensing F-003):** OBJ-004 (Sustainability and Energy) carries 15 evaluation points. The following mechanical system selections directly influence OBJ-004 scoring and should be explicitly mapped to evaluator expectations during proposal preparation:

| Mechanical System Choice | OBJ-004 Scoring Relevance | Key Decisions |
|---|---|---|
| HVAC plant efficiency (condensing boiler vs. heat pump vs. standard) | Demonstrates energy-conscious design; higher efficiency = stronger sustainability narrative | Specification R-MEL-12, R-MEL-13; Trade-off T-001 |
| Energy recovery ventilation (ERV/HRV) for office/residential zones | Directly supports energy performance claims; cold climate ERV payback is strong | Specification R-MEL-11 |
| Solar-ready roof provisions | Addendum 03 §1.17 explicitly requires solar-capable roof; demonstrating integration shows sustainability commitment | Coordination with Architectural/Electrical |
| Building envelope coordination (insulation, air sealing) | Envelope is the first energy priority; mechanical system sizing is secondary to envelope performance | Coordination with DEL-04-01 (Building Envelope and Energy Strategy) |
| Demand-controlled ventilation options | Reduces energy waste; demonstrates advanced design thinking | Consideration C-001 (apparatus bay); Specification R-MEL-02 |
| Domestic hot water efficiency | High-efficiency heat source reduces fossil fuel consumption | Specification R-MEL-16; Trade-off T-004 |

**Note:** The proposal narrative should explicitly connect each of the above mechanical choices to sustainability and energy outcomes to maximize OBJ-004 score. This linkage should be coordinated with DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy and Solar Readiness) to present a unified sustainability message across the proposal. **ASSUMPTION:** OBJ-004 scoring criteria reward explicit demonstration of energy-efficient system selections; actual evaluation rubric weighting not available at concept stage.

### Principle P-004: Maintainability and Lifecycle Cost

**Statement:** Main building is designed for a 50-year life. Mechanical systems must be selected and positioned for reliable, cost-effective operation over this lifecycle, with straightforward access for maintenance and replacement.

**Rationale:** Fire department and public works staff will operate and maintain this facility. Systems that are difficult to access, require specialized technicians, or are prone to failure will frustrate operations and increase lifetime costs. Simple, robust, industry-standard systems are preferable to advanced technology that requires expert maintenance.

**Design Implications:**
- Equipment selection should favor standardized, widely-serviced products from major manufacturers.
- Equipment must be located with adequate access for filter changes, inspection, and replacement (mechanical room headroom, service clearances).
- Maintenance schedules should be developed during design and incorporated into O&M manuals.
- Control systems should be intuitive for operations staff; complex BMS integration requires ongoing IT support that may not be available to a small municipality.

**Sources:** RFP §10.3.4 (easy to maintain); RFP §11.3 (durable, flexible materials for longevity and easy maintenance); OBJ-005 (durability, 15 pts); DEL-05-03 (Mechanical Maintainability, PKG-005).

---

### Principle P-005: Coordination and Interface Clarity

**Statement:** Mechanical systems cannot be designed in isolation. Explicit interface management with Architectural, Structural, Civil, and Electrical disciplines at concept stage prevents costly redesigns during detailed design.

**Rationale:** Apparatus bay exhaust ductwork needs clearance above 16 ft doors. Sump pits require floor slab penetrations and drainage routing. Generator electrical specs must be passed to Electrical for ATS design. Decontamination room drains require structural slab penetrations. These interfaces are easy to miss if not explicitly addressed early.

**Design Implications:**
- Document all cross-discipline interfaces explicitly in the concept narrative (Datasheet interface table, this Guidance section).
- Identify potential coordination risks early (e.g., exhaust duct routing above 16 ft door line must be confirmed with architectural ceiling height).
- Assign clear responsibility for each interface (example: Structural provides sump pit floor opening; Mechanical provides sump liner and pump selection; Structural provides decontamination drain opening; Mechanical provides drain specification).
- Use design coordination meetings at 60% design phase to resolve all interface ambiguities before IFC drawings.

**Sources:** RFP §7.1.8 (detailed design and construction documents plan); OBJ-002 (delivery plan); Decomposition scope ledger.

---

### Principle P-006: Completeness — Address Every Functional Room's Mechanical Needs

**Statement:** The Functional Program and Addendum 03 §1.21 define many rooms that have specific mechanical requirements beyond simple heating and ventilation. The mechanical concept must address each of these rooms explicitly.

**Rationale:** Evaluators will check whether the mechanical concept covers the full building program. Omissions — such as failing to address decontamination plumbing or SCBA climate control — signal incomplete design thinking and reduce the OBJ-003 score.

**Design Implications:**
- Review each room in the Functional Program (Appendix B) and Addendum 03 §1.21 size table for mechanical requirements.
- Key rooms requiring more than standard HVAC: apparatus bays (exhaust, sump, fill station), PW bays (ventilation, sump, fill station), bunker gear room (exhaust), decontamination room and showers (hot water, drains, exhaust), SCBA room (climate control), compressor room (heat rejection ventilation), kitchen (range hoods, dishwasher plumbing).
- Laundry sets (OSR §12.6) require hot and cold water supply and drain connections; verify residential laundry setups are in mechanical scope.
- Second story (if adopted, Addendum 03 §1.5) must be included in HVAC zoning to avoid a cold zone above occupied shared spaces.

**Sources:** Add 03 §1.21 (room sizing table); OSR §12.6 (appliance list); Add 03 §1.5 (second story permissible); Functional Program Appendix B.

## Considerations

### Consideration C-001: Apparatus Bay Exhaust — Control Strategy

**Issue:** How should the apparatus bay exhaust system be controlled and sized?

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: Continuous Low-Flow + High-Flow** | Fan runs continuously at 20–25% speed when bay empty; ramps to full when damper opens | Moisture management even when bay empty; always ready | Continuous fan energy use |
| **B: Manual Damper Control** | Exhaust damper opened manually when apparatus in bay; fan at full speed only when open | Simple; low cost; no sensors | Requires operator discipline; moisture may accumulate |
| **C: Demand-Controlled (Sensor)** | CO sensor or door sensor activates fan and damper; energy-optimal | Energy-efficient; smart operation | Added sensor/controls cost; requires BMS integration |

**Recommendation for Design Phase Evaluation:**
- Preferred concept: Option A (continuous low + demand high) — balances moisture management and energy efficiency.
- Acceptable alternative: Option B if capital budget is tight and operational discipline is assured.
- Advanced approach: Option C if BMS is planned; present cost-benefit to Owner.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-01, R-MEL-02; Procedure Step B2.

---

### Consideration C-002: Generator Backup Power Scope

**Issue:** Addendum 03 §1.15 specifies minimum loads (kitchen, ICP/meeting room, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening). Should additional loads be included?

**Options:**

| Option | Loads | Est. Generator Size | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Minimum (Addendum 03 explicit)** | Kitchen + ICP/meeting room + 2 bathrooms + bay door mechanism | ~20–25 kW | Code minimum; loses comms/alarm during outage |
| **Minimum + Essential Safety** | Add fire alarm panel + emergency lighting + one radio circuit | ~25–30 kW | Ensures critical fire department communications |
| **Extended (Optional)** | Add apparatus bay lighting, most living quarters | ~35–50 kW | Full partial-operations capability |

**Recommendation for Design Phase Evaluation:**
- Baseline: Addendum 03 minimum (Option 1). Size generator ~20–25 kW.
- Value-add: Present Option 2 (+fire alarm/comms) to Owner during design. Incremental cost (~$3K–5K) is typically justified for a fire hall's critical role in emergency response.
- Design flexibility: Specify main electrical panel with spare breaker capacity to allow future generator load expansion.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-21, R-MEL-22, R-MEL-23, R-MEL-24; Example EX-002.

---

### Consideration C-003: Apparatus Bay Exhaust — Makeup Air Strategy

**Issue:** Apparatus bay exhaust removes large air volumes (estimated 10,000–15,000 CFM during operation), creating negative pressure. Where does makeup air come from?

**Options:**

| Option | Approach | Pro | Con |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Passive Louver** | Makeup air enters via louvered opening(s) in wall or door | Simple; no equipment cost | Cold air infiltration in winter; frost risk on louver |
| **Dedicated Makeup Fan** | Separate intake fan supplies tempered makeup air | Controlled; better air quality; winter heating recovery possible | Added equipment cost and controls complexity |
| **HVAC Integration** | Main HVAC system supplies makeup air to apparatus bay | Integrated control | Over-sizes HVAC for occasional high-demand event |

**Recommendation:** Passive high-performance louver (drainable, insulated, with gravity backdraft damper) for cost efficiency. Dedicated makeup fan preferred if budget allows — especially in cold climate where tempered makeup air improves comfort and prevents moisture issues.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-02, R-MEL-03; Consideration C-001.

---

### Consideration C-004: Bay Sump Discharge Routing

**Issue:** Apparatus and PW bay sumps must discharge somewhere. Options depend on civil and site conditions.

**Options:**

| Option | Approach | Pro | Con |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Daylight discharge** | Pump to surface drainage location | Natural; no sewer tie-in | Environmental/wetland constraints; freeze-up risk |
| **Percolation-infiltration field** | Discharge to on-site drywell or percolation bed | On-site management; no sewer impact | Requires suitable soil (2021 geotech); winter freeze-up risk |
| **Municipal sanitary sewer** | Pump discharges to on-site sanitary drainage | Simple; uses existing infrastructure | Requires permit; separation requirements may apply |

**Recommendation for Design Phase:** Civil and Mechanical coordinate based on 2021 geotechnical report (Appendix D) and site grading (Appendix E). Municipal sewer connection is simplest if permitted. Percolation field if soil conditions confirmed suitable and wetland assessment (Appendix D) shows no constraints.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-18, R-MEL-19; Example EX-003.

---

### Consideration C-005: Fire Sprinkler System — Wet vs. Dry

**Issue:** Fire code permits wet or dry sprinkler systems. Which is appropriate in a fire hall in a cold climate?

**Wet System:**
- Pipes filled with water; immediate discharge on heat activation.
- Simple and reliable; no air compressor needed.
- Risk: freeze-up if apparatus bay temperature not maintained above 0°C at all times.
- Feasible if bay thermal conditioning (heating + door controls) prevents freezing.

**Dry System:**
- Pipes filled with compressed air; water held back until heat activation triggers valve.
- No freeze-up risk in unheated or variable-temperature spaces.
- Slightly more complex; requires air compressor and compressed air maintenance.
- Better suited if apparatus bays cannot guarantee freeze-safe temperature.

**Recommendation for Design Phase:** Consult AHJ for preference in fire hall application. Confirm whether apparatus bay heating strategy can reliably maintain pipes above freezing (especially given frequent 16 ft door openings in winter). If thermal reliability is confirmed, wet system is preferred (simpler, lower maintenance). If not, specify dry system for apparatus bay zone.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-25, R-MEL-26, R-MEL-27.

---

### Consideration C-006: Decontamination Drain Disposal

**Issue:** Wastewater from decontamination showers may contain trace contaminants from firefighting activities. Standard sanitary sewer disposal may require pre-treatment or special permits.

**Options:**

| Option | Approach | Pro | Con |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard Sanitary Sewer** | Drain connects directly to sanitary stack | Simple; lowest cost | May require AHJ/environmental permit; depends on contaminant levels |
| **Holding Tank + Periodic Disposal** | Capture and periodically empty via licensed hauler | Positive control of contaminants | Operational burden; ongoing cost |
| **Pre-Treatment + Sanitary** | Small treatment unit before sewer connection | Best practice; defensible | Higher capital and maintenance cost |

**Recommendation for Design Phase:** Confirm with AHJ and environmental consultant. Most fire halls in Alberta use standard sanitary connection for decontamination showers; pre-treatment is atypical at this scale but may be locally required. Confirm early in design development to avoid costly late-stage redesign.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-08a, R-MEL-08b.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off T-001: HVAC System Efficiency vs. First Cost

**Statement:** High-efficiency HVAC equipment (condensing boiler, heat pump, ERV/HRV) costs more upfront but significantly less to operate over 50 years.

| Factor | Standard Equipment | High-Efficiency Equipment |
|---|---|---|
| First Cost | Lower (baseline) | +10–20% higher |
| Annual Operating Cost | Higher | -20–30% lower |
| Lifecycle Cost (50 years) | Higher (operating costs dominate) | Lower (efficiency savings exceed premium) |
| NECB Code Compliance | May not meet targets | Easily meets targets |
| Owner Operating Bills | Higher | Lower |

**Rough Order-of-Magnitude Lifecycle Comparison (ASSUMPTION: representative institutional building in Alberta cold climate):**

| Parameter | Standard Equipment | High-Efficiency Equipment | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| First cost premium | Baseline | +10-20% (~$15K-30K for a building of this size) | Industry estimating guides; ASSUMPTION |
| Annual energy savings | Baseline | ~$2,000-4,000/year (ASSUMPTION: natural gas heating at $0.04-0.06/m3; 20-30% efficiency improvement over standard) | NECB energy modeling benchmarks for institutional buildings in Climate Zone 7A; ASSUMPTION -- actual savings depend on building envelope, occupancy, and utility rates |
| Simple payback | -- | ~5-10 years | Savings / premium; ASSUMPTION |
| 50-year net savings | -- | ~$70K-170K (undiscounted) | 50 years x annual savings minus premium; ASSUMPTION -- does not account for discount rate, escalation, or replacement cycles |

This comparison is illustrative only and must be confirmed with project-specific energy modeling during design development. However, even at this rough level, the payback period is well within the 50-year building life, supporting the recommendation below. (Lensing C-003)

**Recommendation:** Default to high-efficiency equipment. 50-year lifecycle cost comparison almost always favors the efficiency premium for institutional buildings. Present project-specific analysis to Owner during design development, using the rough estimates above as a starting point for discussion.

**Cross-Reference:** Principle P-003; Specification R-MEL-12, R-MEL-13.

---

### Trade-off T-002: Apparatus Bay Exhaust — Continuous vs. Demand Control

**Statement:** Continuous low-speed exhaust provides better moisture management at modest energy cost. Demand-controlled exhaust uses less energy but needs reliable sensors.

| Factor | Continuous Low-Speed | Demand-Controlled |
|---|---|---|
| Energy Use | Moderate (continuous) | Low (on-demand) |
| Moisture Management | Good | Marginal (between uses) |
| Capital Cost | Lower | Higher (+sensors/controls) |
| Operational Simplicity | High | Medium (sensor calibration) |
| Fire Department Preference | High (passive, always ready) | Medium (sensor-dependent) |

**Recommendation:** Continuous low-speed with manual damper is the cost-effective baseline for a small municipal fire hall. Demand control is a value-add worth presenting to Owner.

**Cross-Reference:** Consideration C-001; Specification R-MEL-01.

---

### Trade-off T-003: Generator Minimum Loads vs. Extended Backup

**Statement:** Minimum specified loads (Addendum 03 §1.15) support a smaller, less expensive generator. Including fire alarm/communications loads adds modest cost but significantly improves emergency operations resilience.

| Scope | Approx. Generator Size | Approx. Equipment Cost | Operational Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Addendum 03 minimum (kitchen + ICP + 2 bathrooms + bay door) | ~20–25 kW | ~$15K–20K | Meets code; loses fire alarm/comms during outage |
| + Fire alarm + emergency lighting + radio | ~25–30 kW | ~$20K–25K (+$5K) | Maintains critical comms and life safety during outage |
| Extended (full partial operations) | ~35–50 kW | ~$30K–40K (+$15K) | Near-full operations; Owner decision required |

**Recommendation:** Baseline = Addendum 03 minimum. Present +fire alarm/comms option to Owner as a low-cost incremental improvement that meaningfully supports the facility's emergency response role. Document panel capacity for future expansion.

**Cross-Reference:** Consideration C-002; Specification R-MEL-21 through R-MEL-24.

---

### Trade-off T-004: Domestic Hot Water — Tankless vs. Storage Tank

**Statement:** The confirmed appliance list (OSR §12.6) and Addendum 03 §1.21 decontamination showers create a higher peak hot water demand than a simple office building. The choice between tankless and storage tank affects cost, reliability, and sizing.

| Factor | Tankless (On-Demand) | Storage Tank |
|---|---|---|
| Capital Cost | Higher per unit | Lower |
| Operating Cost | Lower (no standby losses) | Higher (standby heat losses) |
| Simultaneous Demand | Multiple units may be needed for high simultaneous use | Single tank can buffer simultaneous demand events |
| Reliability | Single unit failure affects all; redundancy requires 2 units | One tank failure; second tank possible |
| Maintenance | Scale buildup in hard water areas; more critical maintenance | Simpler; periodic flush |

**Recommendation:** For this building with decontamination showers + kitchen dishwasher + laundry sets + bathrooms, consider a primary storage tank for buffering high simultaneous demand with a high-efficiency heat source. Tankless point-of-use units are acceptable for remote fixtures (e.g., compressor room washbasin). Confirm peak demand calculation in design phase.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-16; Principle P-003.

## Examples

### Example EX-001: Fire Apparatus Bay Exhaust — Typical Fire Hall Design

**Scenario:** Fire apparatus bay, nominally 50 ft x 40 ft, with 16 ft overhead door height minimum (Addendum 03 §1.10).

**Design Approach:**
1. **Exhaust Fan:** Single dedicated exhaust fan (10,000–15,000 CFM) roof-mounted or on exterior wall above bay. Ductwork runs from bay interior to fan inlet; intake connection point at each apparatus position (stub with collar for tailpipe capture hose).
2. **Damper:** Motorized exhaust damper at fan inlet. Opens when apparatus present; closes when bay empty (continuous low-speed or demand-controlled per Consideration C-001).
3. **Discharge:** Roof cap or wall louver with backdraft damper prevents weather infiltration.
4. **Makeup Air:** Louvered wall opening (drainable, insulated, gravity backdraft damper) sized to match exhaust volume; located on opposite wall from exhaust for effective cross-ventilation.
5. **Ductwork:** Routed above the 16 ft door line, inside building envelope where possible; insulated to prevent condensation; sized for 3,000–4,000 fpm velocity in mains.
6. **Controls:** Door sensor or manual switch opens damper and activates fan when apparatus enters bay.

**Rough Cost Estimate:** ~$8K–12K per bay (fan, damper, ductwork, louver, controls). Actual cost TBD in design phase.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-01, R-MEL-02, R-MEL-03; Consideration C-001; Consideration C-003.

---

### Example EX-002: Backup Generator Sizing — Addendum 03 Minimum Loads

**Scenario:** Minimum generator sizing per Addendum 03 §1.15 (kitchen, ICP/meeting room, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening).

**Preliminary Load Estimate:**

| Load | Typical Power (W) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kitchen equipment | 12,000–18,000 | Stove, oven, refrigerators, microwave — 50% simultaneous use factor |
| ICP/Meeting Room | 2,000–3,000 | Lighting, computers, projector, HVAC (reduced) |
| 2 Bathrooms | 2,000–4,000 | Lighting, ventilation fan, electric water heater (if tankless) |
| Bay door secondary mechanism | 500–1,500 | Electric opener (if generator-powered); or zero if manual override chosen |
| Emergency/exit lighting | 2,000–3,000 | Corridor and egress path |
| HVAC (minimal) | 4,000–6,000 | Reduced capacity to maintain safety in essential areas |
| **Subtotal** | ~22,500–35,500 W | |
| Diversity factor (0.7) | — | Not all loads simultaneous |
| **Design Load** | ~16,000–25,000 W | |
| Generator size with 25% margin | **~20–30 kW** | Recommend 25 kW unit as concept baseline |

**Generator Concept Specification:**
- Capacity: 25 kW (concept estimate; design phase load calc to confirm)
- Fuel: Natural gas preferred (municipal gas within a few feet of site per Addendum 03 §1.6); diesel as fallback
- Location: Outdoor pad-mounted with weatherproof enclosure (ASSUMPTION per Functional Program row 30.0)
- Transfer: Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS); <4 second switchover typical

**Rough Cost Estimate:** ~$18K–25K (generator unit + ATS + installation + fuel system). Actual cost TBD in design phase.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-21 through R-MEL-24; Trade-off T-003; Consideration C-002.

---

### Example EX-003: Bay Sump Design — Snow Melt and Wash Water

**Scenario:** Apparatus bay (approximately 2,000–2,200 sf per Addendum 03 §1.21) with floor sump per Addendum 03 §1.8.

**Design Approach:**
1. **Sump Pit:** Typically one corner of bay, at lowest point of sloped floor. Approximate size: 4 ft x 4 ft x 3 ft deep (48 cubic feet). Structural provides floor opening; Mechanical provides liner and pump.
2. **Floor Slope:** Bay floor sloped at 0.5–1% toward sump for drainage collection.
3. **Pump:** Submersible sump pump (0.5–1.5 hp, 50–150 gpm) with float-activated control.
4. **Discharge:** Routed to municipal sanitary sewer (preferred if permitted) or on-site percolation field (if geotech confirms soil conditions). Discharge piping insulated or trace-heated to prevent freeze-up.
5. **Access:** Removable grate or solid cover for safety and debris exclusion; routine cleanout access.
6. **Coordination:** Sump location finalized with Structural (slab penetration) and Civil (discharge routing) during design development.

**Rough Cost Estimate:** ~$5K–8K per sump (pit, liner, pump, piping, discharge connection). Actual cost TBD.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-18, R-MEL-19; Consideration C-004.

---

### Example EX-004: Decontamination Room and Shower Plumbing Concept

**Scenario:** Decontamination room (150–200 sf) + 2 decontamination showers/WR (50–60 sf each) per Addendum 03 §1.21.

**Design Approach:**
1. **Water Supply:** Hot and cold water branches from main building domestic supply; minimum 3/4" branches to decontamination area; tempering valve at showers to prevent scalding (ASSUMPTION: code requirement).
2. **Floor Drains:** Minimum one floor drain per room with trap primer to prevent trap dryout; traps sized for typical firefighter decontamination flow rates.
3. **Sanitary Drainage:** Dedicated branch drain from decontamination area to main sanitary stack; avoid combining decontamination drains with other sanitary drainage where possible (ASSUMPTION: fire hall best practice).
4. **Ventilation:** Dedicated exhaust fan, minimum 10 air changes per hour (ASSUMPTION: tile or wet room minimum); exhaust to exterior or roof; no recirculation.
5. **Coordination:** Confirm drain locations with Architectural layout before structural slab poured; Structural provides slab opening; Mechanical provides drain specification.

**Rough Cost Estimate:** ~$8K–15K (plumbing rough-in, fixtures, exhaust fan, decon shower fixtures). Actual cost TBD in design phase.

**Cross-Reference:** Specification R-MEL-08a, R-MEL-08b, R-MEL-08c, R-MEL-32; Consideration C-006.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

All mechanical requirements from RFP §11, Addendum 03, and OSR are consistent with each other and with standard fire hall/public works facility design practice, except for the generator sizing range inconsistency noted below. Additional contradictions, if identified during design development, will be recorded here for human resolution.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CON-001 | Generator capacity range varies across documents: Datasheet states "25-30 kW (ASSUMPTION)"; Specification R-MEL-24 states "25-30 kW"; Guidance EX-002 calculates design load at 16,000-25,000 W and recommends "25 kW unit as concept baseline"; Guidance C-002 Option 1 states "~20-25 kW" for minimum loads only. The ranges overlap but are not identical, risking confusion in design phase load calculations. (Lensing B-003) | Datasheet > Construction > Backup Generator (25-30 kW); Specification R-MEL-24 (25-30 kW) | Guidance C-002 Option 1 (20-25 kW minimum loads); Guidance EX-002 (design load 16-25 kW, recommends 25 kW baseline) | Specification R-MEL-24; Datasheet Construction table; Guidance C-002; Guidance EX-002 | Specification (PROPOSAL: the different figures represent different load scopes -- minimum-only vs. minimum + essential safety; reconcile to a single stated concept range after detailed load calculation in design phase; current best estimate for concept baseline is 25 kW per EX-002) | TBD |

### Terminology Note (Lensing X-004)

The following canonical terms should be used consistently across all four documents. Where legacy or RFP-source terminology differs, the canonical term governs for cross-discipline coordination:

| Canonical Term | Aliases Found in Source Documents | Governing Source |

| **PW bays** (Public Works Equipment Bays) | "Workshop Bays", "Workshop/Storage Bay" (Addendum 03 §1.21 / Functional Program row 28.0), "PW bay", "Public Works equipment bays" | Addendum 03 §1.21 room sizing table; Functional Program row 28.0. **ASSUMPTION:** "PW bays" is adopted as the short-form canonical term for cross-document consistency; full form "Public Works Equipment Bays" used at first mention in each document. |

**Note:** The Addendum 03 §1.21 room sizing table uses "Workshop/Storage Bay" for Public Works bays, and the Functional Program (row 28.0) uses "Workshop/Storage Bay." The documents in this deliverable use "PW bays" as the standard short form. All terms refer to the same space. This normalization is recorded here per Lensing X-004 to prevent confusion during cross-discipline coordination.
