## Cost Drivers (from Brief)

The mechanical energy and solar readiness narrative scope encompasses:
- High-efficiency heating/cooling equipment selection rationale
- Heat recovery opportunities (ERV/HRV for apparatus bays and office zones)
- Ventilation energy optimization (demand-controlled ventilation, economizer strategies)
- Domestic hot water (DHW) efficiency approach
- Solar-ready mechanical provisions (roof penetration rough-in, piping routes for future solar thermal)
- Energy metering and monitoring provisions for major mechanical systems

## Scope Boundary Notes

Per Cost Ownership Rules in the brief:
- Mechanical energy efficiency narrative cost is owned entirely by DEL-04-02
- DEL-04-02 addresses energy-related aspects of mechanical systems (NOT the base system selection, which is DEL-02-04 Mechanical Concept Narrative)
- DEL-04-02 addresses energy-related aspects of mechanical systems (NOT maintainability, which is DEL-05-03)
- Solar-ready STRUCTURAL provisions (loading) are owned by DEL-02-03, not DEL-04-02
- Solar-ready ELECTRICAL provisions (conduit, panel space, inverter) are owned by DEL-04-03, not DEL-04-02

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No critical warnings.** All line items are fully priced with source evidence.
- **Dependency note:** DEL-04-02 has upstream execution prerequisites on:
  - DEL-04-01 (Building Envelope and Energy Strategy) for envelope U-value targets
  - DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept Narrative) for baseline HVAC system types
  - DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept) for roof orientation
  - DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept) for site plan orientation
  - DEL-02-03 (Structural Concept) for solar panel structural loading allowance
  These are informational for production sequencing; they do not block pricing.
- **Downstream interface:** DEL-04-02 outputs feed DEL-05-03 (Mechanical Maintainability) for maintenance of energy-efficient systems.

## RUN_STATUS: OK
