## Basis Configuration

- **Method:** RATE_TABLE (all line items)
- **Fallback policy:** STRICT (no fallback used)
- **Mixed methods:** Not allowed; not needed (all RATE_TABLE)

## Key Observations

1. DEL-07-03 is a narrative deliverable (Construction / Narrative type). The cost represents professional hours to author the subconsultant approach section of the proposal per RFP Section 7.3.4.
2. One role contributes: Project Manager (primary author, 8 hrs). The brief mentions "PM/construction manager hours" as cost drivers, but Level_of_Effort.csv only assigns PM hours to this deliverable. The Construction Manager's hours are allocated to DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) and DEL-07-02 (Construction Administration) instead.
3. Total effort is 8 hours at $175/hr.
4. The narrative scope includes confirming required disciplines (architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, specialty), describing management/interface approach, and documenting the geotechnical review protocol based on the existing 2021 USG1123 report only (per DEC-013 -- no additional investigation).
5. Dependencies exist to DEL-01-09 (Appendix I consistency), DEL-01-08 (key personnel resumes), DEL-07-01 (team accountability alignment), DEL-07-02 (inspection obligation consistency), and DEL-10-02 (geotech protocol alignment) -- none of these represent pricing blockers; they are interface/consistency requirements for content production.

## Warnings and Blockers

- None. RUN_STATUS = OK.
