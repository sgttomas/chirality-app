| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source/Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | PM rate of $175/hr CAD is appropriate for this deliverable | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv row R-02; MARKET basis; MEDIUM confidence | If actual PM rate differs, total scales linearly (8 hrs x delta). At +/- $25/hr, impact is +/- $200. |
| ASM-002 | 8 hours is sufficient for PM to author the subconsultant approach narrative covering all SOW-0021 topics | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-07-03/R-02; PARAMETRIC basis within LOE source | If narrative requires more PM time (e.g., due to complex subconsultant negotiations or additional geotech review depth), cost would increase proportionally. Each additional hour = $175. |
| ASM-003 | No Construction Manager hours are needed for DEL-07-03 specifically | Level_of_Effort.csv does not assign CM hours to DEL-07-03; CM hours allocated to DEL-07-01 and DEL-07-02 | If CM review/input is needed specifically for the subconsultant approach section, additional hours at $155/hr would be required. |
| ASM-004 | Geotechnical review protocol is limited to existing 2021 USG1123 report review | DEC-013 in decomposition; no additional investigation | If additional geotech investigation is later required, the narrative scope and cost would need revision. However, this is a scope decision (DEC-013), not an estimating assumption. |
