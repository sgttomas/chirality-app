## Key Observations

1. **Scope**: This estimate covers proposal production cost only -- the hours to write the Detailed Design & Construction Documents Plan narrative for the proposal submission. It does not cover downstream design execution costs.

2. **Cost drivers**: The Design Manager is the primary cost driver (70% of total), responsible for defining the 5 design submission milestones, discipline deliverables list, coordination approach, and QA/QC checkpoints. The Project Manager contributes Owner review cycle and coordination input (30% of total).

3. **Confidence**: MED on both lines. Hours are sourced from a PARAMETRIC basis level-of-effort estimate; rates are MARKET-based.

## Blockers and Warnings

- **0 blockers** identified from dependency evidence that would prevent pricing.
- **0 warnings** -- all inputs resolved; no TBD amounts.
