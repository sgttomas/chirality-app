## Summary

No blockers to pricing were identified. All required pricing inputs are available.

## Upstream Dependencies (from Dependencies.csv)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Pricing Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-03-003 | DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None. Hours and rate are independent of upstream deliverable completion. |
| DEP-05-03-004 | DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy & Solar Readiness) | PREREQUISITE | PENDING | None. Hours and rate are independent of upstream deliverable completion. |
| DEP-05-03-006 | DEL-05-01 (Architectural Durability & Maintenance) | INTERFACE | TBD | None. Coordination interface does not change pricing. |
| DEP-05-03-007 | DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability & Maintenance) | INTERFACE | TBD | None. Coordination interface does not change pricing. |
| DEP-05-03-009 | RFP 2024_004 | CONSTRAINT | TBD | None. Governing document is available. |
| DEP-05-03-010 | Addendum 03 | CONSTRAINT | TBD | None. Governing document is available. |
| DEP-05-03-011 | 2021 Geotechnical Report | PREREQUISITE | TBD | None. Reference document for sump pit design context; does not affect narrative production hours. |

## Conclusion

While DEL-05-03 has upstream prerequisites (DEL-02-04 and DEL-04-02 must be substantially complete before finalization), these dependencies affect **execution sequencing**, not the **cost estimate**. The estimate of $1,280 CAD (8 hours x $160/hr) is independent of upstream completion status.
