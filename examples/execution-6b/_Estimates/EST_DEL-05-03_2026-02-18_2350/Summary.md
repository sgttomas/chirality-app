## Cost Composition

| Role | Hours | Rate ($/hr) | Amount (CAD) | % of Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mechanical Engineer (Senior) [R-11] | 8 | $160 | $1,280 | 100% |
| **Total** | **8** | | **$1,280** | **100%** |

## Key Observations

1. **Single-role deliverable.** DEL-05-03 is assigned only to R-11 (Mechanical Engineer Senior) per the Level of Effort table. This is consistent with its nature as a discipline-specific narrative authored by the mechanical systems lead.

2. **Cost ownership is clean.** Mechanical maintainability content belongs exclusively to DEL-05-03. Energy efficiency and solar readiness content belongs to DEL-04-02. Mechanical design brief content belongs to DEL-03-04. There is no double-counting across these deliverables.

3. **Upstream dependencies identified.** DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept Narrative) and DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy & Solar Readiness) are prerequisites. Both are currently PENDING. This does not affect the estimate amount but is noted for scheduling and readiness.

4. **No blockers to pricing.** All required pricing inputs (rate + hours) are available and substantiated. No TBD amounts.

## Warnings and Blockers

- None. RUN_STATUS = OK.
