# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-05-03_2026-02-18_2350

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source/Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | The Mechanical Engineer (Senior) at $160/hr CAD is the correct and sole role for producing DEL-05-03 content. | Level_of_Effort.csv (row DEL-05-03, R-11) and Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (R-11 = $160/hr) | If an intermediate mechanical engineer or additional coordination hours are needed, the estimate would increase. The LoE table does not assign R-12 (Mechanical Engineer Intermediate) to this deliverable. |
| ASM-002 | 8 hours is sufficient for the mechanical maintainability narrative covering HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, generator, and ventilation filter access/maintenance. | Level_of_Effort.csv (R-11, 8 hours, PARAMETRIC basis) | If the narrative requires deeper lifecycle cost analysis or detailed maintenance schedule development beyond a proposal-level narrative, hours could increase. The LoE basis is PARAMETRIC (not CONFIRMED), indicating this is an estimate. |
| ASM-003 | No QA/review hours from the Project Manager or other roles are required for this deliverable. | Level_of_Effort.csv -- only one row exists for DEL-05-03 (R-11). No PM review row present. | Other deliverables in PKG-005 also lack PM review rows in the LoE, suggesting this is a deliberate modeling choice for discipline-specific durability narratives. If PM review is added later, cost increases by the PM hourly rate x review hours. |
| ASM-004 | Upstream dependency completion (DEL-02-04, DEL-04-02) does not affect the cost estimate, only the scheduling/readiness of DEL-05-03. | Dependencies.csv (DEP-05-03-003, DEP-05-03-004) | If upstream scope changes cause mechanical system selections to be substantially different than expected, the maintainability narrative scope could expand, but this is a scope change, not a pricing source gap. |
