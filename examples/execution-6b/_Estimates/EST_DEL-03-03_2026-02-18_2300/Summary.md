## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No pricing blockers.** All hours and rates are sourced from provided price sources.
- **Dependency blocker (informational):** DEP-03-03-012 identifies that confirmed equipment clearance dimensions (dump truck, grader, fire apparatus heights) are essential inputs for eave height determination. These dimensions are external Owner inputs not yet confirmed. This does not block the estimate (hours are still valid for producing the brief), but it does represent a scope uncertainty that could affect content quality.
- **Upstream prerequisites:** DEL-02-03 (Structural Concept Narrative), DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan), and DEL-03-01 (Architectural Design Brief) are listed as prerequisites. These affect production sequencing, not the cost of producing this deliverable.
