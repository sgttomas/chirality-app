## Key Context

- DEL-01-06 is a **Tier 4 deliverable** (depends on DEL-01-04 Schedule A and DEL-01-05 Schedule B being substantially complete).
- This estimate covers **production cost only** -- the hours required to write the pricing narrative and assumptions document.
- The deliverable does NOT contain construction pricing; it explains the decisions behind DEL-01-04/05 pricing.
- Content scope: allowances (site servicing, FF&E $20K), exclusions (pickled sand, no additional geotech), CCIP inclusion statement, value alternatives.
- DEL-01-04 Schedule A total: $7,710,000 (base $7,327,000 + options $383,000) -- referenced for context only.

## Warnings and Blockers

**Warnings:** None.

**Blockers (from dependency analysis):**
- DEP-0106-005: DEL-01-05 (Schedule B) must be at least 80% complete before narrative proceeds beyond placeholder stage. Status: PENDING.
- DEP-0106-007: DEL-01-04 (Schedule A) draft required for cross-reference. Status: PENDING.
- DEP-0106-006: DEL-01-03 (Bonding & Insurance) required for CCIP cross-reference. Status: PENDING.

These blockers affect the *execution sequencing* of the deliverable, not the estimate itself. The production hours are valid regardless of execution order.
