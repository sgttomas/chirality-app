# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-01-06_2026-02-18_2359

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| EST-ASM-001 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are current and applicable for this engagement | MARKET rates with MEDIUM confidence per source file | If actual rates differ, total scales linearly. A 10% rate increase would add ~$326 to the total. |
| EST-ASM-002 | Level of effort (12 hrs PM + 8 hrs Estimator = 20 hrs total) is sufficient to produce the pricing narrative and assumptions document | PARAMETRIC basis per Level_of_Effort.csv with MEDIUM confidence | If scope is more complex than anticipated (e.g., additional value alternatives analysis, more iterations with DEL-01-04/05 authors), hours could increase. |
| EST-ASM-003 | This estimate covers production hours only; no construction pricing content is included in DEL-01-06 cost | Per brief: "This is PURE PRODUCTION COST" | If construction pricing content were in scope, the estimate would be materially different. |
| EST-ASM-004 | One review/revision cycle is included in the estimated hours | Implicit in the LoE allocation | If multiple revision cycles are required (e.g., due to late changes in DEL-01-04/05), additional PM and estimator hours may be needed. |
| EST-ASM-005 | No overtime, premium rates, or travel costs apply | Standard business-hours assumption | If rush delivery requires overtime, a premium multiplier would apply. |
