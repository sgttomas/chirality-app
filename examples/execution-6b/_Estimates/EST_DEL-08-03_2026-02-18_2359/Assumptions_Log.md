# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-08-03_2026-02-18_2359

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | PM (R-02) and Commissioning Lead (R-21) are the only roles required for DEL-08-03 | Level_of_Effort.csv (only 2 rows for DEL-08-03) | If additional roles are needed (e.g., Legal Review for SC54-SC55 interpretation), cost would increase. Likely impact: +$300-$600 for 1-2 hrs legal review. |
| ASM-002 | 4 hours per role is sufficient for warranty narrative authoring | Level_of_Effort.csv; Basis = PARAMETRIC | If scope complexity increases (e.g., detailed SC54-SC55 clause-by-clause analysis), hours could increase by 50-100%. Impact: +$630-$1,260. |
| ASM-003 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are current and applicable | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; Basis = MARKET; Confidence = MEDIUM | If rates are outdated or negotiated differently, amounts would shift proportionally. MEDIUM confidence noted in source. |
| ASM-004 | DEL-08-03 cost is independent of DEL-08-01 and DEL-08-02 content | Run analysis: hours are fixed regardless of upstream content | True for cost estimation. If upstream deliverables reveal warranty complexity requiring additional hours, a re-estimate would be needed. |
| ASM-005 | No external legal review is needed for warranty provisions beyond PM authoring | Level_of_Effort.csv does not include R-25 (Legal Review) for DEL-08-03 | If legal review of SC54-SC55 or CCDC 14-2013 GC 12.5 is required, this would be an additional cost not captured in this estimate. |
