| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Justification | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Level_of_Effort.csv hours (8 hr Quality Lead, 4 hr PM) are sufficient for a quality management narrative covering 4 QC domains plus NMS recommendation | Level_of_Effort.csv basis = PARAMETRIC; notes indicate coverage of "Design QC; construction QC; commissioning QC; documentation QC" | If quality narrative scope expands (e.g., detailed inspection checklists, test protocols), additional hours may be needed. Estimate would increase. |
| ASM-002 | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv rates are representative of market rates for Alberta-based Design-Build proposal work in 2024-2026 | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv Basis = MARKET, Confidence = MEDIUM | If actual rates differ, total scales proportionally. +/- 15% rate variation = +/- $261 on total. |
| ASM-003 | No external specialist (e.g., third-party QA auditor) hours are required for the quality management narrative | Level_of_Effort.csv lists only R-23 and R-02 for DEL-07-05; no external roles | If an independent QA reviewer is added, additional cost would apply. |
| ASM-004 | The quality management narrative is a proposal-stage document only; no construction-phase QA execution costs are included | DEL-07-05 description states "Quality management narrative per Section 7.2"; this is a proposal deliverable | If the estimate is misinterpreted as including construction-phase QA execution, costs would be significantly higher. |
