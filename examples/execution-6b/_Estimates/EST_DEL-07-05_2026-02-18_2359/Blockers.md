## Summary

No estimate-blocking dependencies identified for DEL-07-05.

## Upstream Prerequisites (SatisfactionStatus = TBD)

These upstream deliverables are listed as prerequisites in the dependency register. Their TBD satisfaction status does not block estimating (hours and rates are independently sourced), but production of DEL-07-05 content depends on these inputs being available.

| DependencyID | Target | Statement | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-05-004 | DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative) | Parent QA/QC responsibility framework and H&S obligations | None -- hours/rates for DEL-07-05 are independently sourced |
| DEP-07-05-005 | DEL-07-03 (Subconsultant Approach Narrative) | Discipline consultants who perform design QC and inspections | None -- hours/rates are role-based, not consultant-specific |
| DEP-07-05-006 | DEL-06-02 (Detailed Design & Construction Docs Plan) | Design QC checkpoint context and submission milestone schedule | None -- hours/rates are independently sourced |

## Upstream Constraints (Documents)

| DependencyID | Target | Statement | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-05-011 | RFP Section 7.2 | Primary normative source: QA/QC and Documentation requirements | None -- scope is confirmed via decomposition |
| DEP-07-05-012 | RFP Section 7.3 | Discipline inspection and documentation obligations | None -- scope is confirmed via decomposition |
| DEP-07-05-013 | CCDC 14-2013 + Appendix J | Design-Build contract quality obligations | None -- scope is confirmed via decomposition |

## Conclusion

**No blockers.** All prerequisites are information-flow dependencies that affect content production, not cost estimation. Hours and rates are independently sourced from Level_of_Effort.csv and Professional_Staff_Rates.csv.
