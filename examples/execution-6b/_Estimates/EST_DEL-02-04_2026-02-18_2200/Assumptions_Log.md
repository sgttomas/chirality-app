# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-02-04_2026-02-18_2200

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hours in Level_of_Effort.csv for DEL-02-04 represent the total effort to produce the mechanical concept narrative, including all technical scope areas (HVAC, exhaust, ventilation, plumbing, generator, fire protection). | Level_of_Effort.csv rows for DEL-02-04 (Execution=6b) | If hours are understated, the deliverable cost would increase. The 24-hour total (16 Sr + 8 Int) appears reasonable for a concept-level narrative. |
| ASM-002 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are current and applicable for the proposal preparation period. | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; Basis=MARKET; Confidence=MEDIUM | If rates change, amounts would need to be recalculated. MEDIUM confidence noted in source. |
| ASM-003 | No additional roles beyond R-11 (Mechanical Engineer Senior) and R-12 (Mechanical Engineer Intermediate) are required for DEL-02-04 production. | Level_of_Effort.csv -- only 2 rows for DEL-02-04 | If PM coordination or CAD support is needed for this narrative, those hours would be captured elsewhere (e.g., DEL-02-01 coordination hours) or the LOE table would need updating. |
| ASM-004 | The mechanical concept narrative is a text document (no drawings), so no CAD/BIM hours are allocated to DEL-02-04. | Decomposition v2.3: DEL-02-04 Type = "Design / Narrative"; Level_of_Effort.csv has no R-06 row for DEL-02-04 | If drawings or diagrams are needed, additional CAD hours would be required. |
