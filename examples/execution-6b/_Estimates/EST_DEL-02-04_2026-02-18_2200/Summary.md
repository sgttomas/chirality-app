## Cost Drivers (from Brief)

The mechanical concept narrative scope encompasses:
- HVAC system selection for all building zones
- Fire apparatus bay direct exhaust ventilation (2 apparatus per bay)
- PW bay general ventilation (occasional idling + very occasional welding)
- Bunker gear room ventilation
- Plumbing (2-inch water fill stations: 1 fire bay, 1 PW bay; bay sumps for snow melting and minor washing)
- Backup generator sizing (kitchen, ICP/meeting room, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening)
- Fire protection system approach

## Scope Boundary Notes

Per Cost Ownership Rules in the brief:
- Mechanical concept NARRATIVE cost is owned entirely by DEL-02-04 (not in DEL-02-01)
- Addendum 03 mechanical requirements (exhaust, generator, fill stations) are costed here in DEL-02-04 (not in DEL-02-01 or DEL-02-05)

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No critical warnings.** All line items are fully priced with source evidence.
- **Dependency note:** DEL-02-04 has 3 upstream execution prerequisites (DEL-02-01 Architectural Concept, DEL-02-02 Civil/Site Concept, DEL-02-03 Structural Concept). These are informational for sequencing; they do not block pricing.
- **Downstream interfaces:** DEL-02-04 outputs feed DEL-02-05 (generator specs), DEL-04-02 (energy/solar), DEL-05-03 (maintainability), and DEL-01-02 (proposal assembly).

## RUN_STATUS: OK
