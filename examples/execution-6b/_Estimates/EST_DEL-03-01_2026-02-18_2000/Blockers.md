## Blockers to Production (Informational)

These do not affect the cost estimate but are relevant for scheduling and readiness.

| DependencyID | Type | Target | Statement | SatisfactionStatus | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-01-004 | PREREQUISITE | DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept Package) | Must be available in draft or final form before authoring begins | TBD | Cannot begin writing the architectural design brief until the concept drawings exist. This is a production sequencing constraint, not a cost constraint. |

## Unresolved Document Inputs (Informational)

The following document dependencies have SatisfactionStatus=TBD. These are constraints on deliverable content (not on the estimate):

- DEP-03-01-005: RFP Section 7.1.2(1) -- defines required topics (available in source docs)
- DEP-03-01-006: OSR Appendix A -- owner architectural requirements
- DEP-03-01-007: Addendum 03 -- special requirements integration
- DEP-03-01-008: Functional Program Appendix B -- room sizing verification
- DEP-03-01-009: Geotechnical Report 2021 -- foundation considerations
