## Cost Drivers

DEL-03-01 is a narrative-only deliverable (no drawings, no CAD production). The sole cost driver is the Architect (Project) role at 12 hours, covering:
- Site plan rationale
- Architectural plan rationale
- Exterior elevation design intent per OSR
- Interior finishes approach
- Functional adjacency rationale
- Program compliance narrative
- Building code compliance approach

This deliverable covers ONLY the architectural sub-brief of SOW-0011. The other four discipline sub-briefs (civil, structural, mechanical, electrical/IT) are estimated separately under DEL-03-02 through DEL-03-05. The accessibility and adaptability narrative is under DEL-03-06.

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers to estimating.** All pricing sources (hours + rates) are available.
- **Upstream production dependency:** DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept Package) must be available in draft form before DEL-03-01 authoring can begin (DEP-03-01-004). This does not affect the cost estimate but affects schedule readiness.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM. Hours are PARAMETRIC-derived; rates are MARKET-based. Both carry MEDIUM confidence per source files.
