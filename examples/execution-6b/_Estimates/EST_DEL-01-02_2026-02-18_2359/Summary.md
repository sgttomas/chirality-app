## Key Observations

1. **Final assembly deliverable.** This is the 38th and final deliverable in the estimation pipeline. All content production costs belong to their respective deliverables; DEL-01-02 covers only the final PDF assembly, submission QA, and revision control logistics.

2. **Dependency-heavy.** DEL-01-02 has 18 execution dependencies spanning all 10 packages. Assembly cannot begin until all other deliverables are complete and reviewed.

3. **Cost ownership is narrow.** At $2,380 this represents pure administrative/production cost for physical assembly. The substantive proposal content creation costs are captured in the 37 preceding deliverable estimates.

4. **No blockers to estimation.** Both price sources (LOE hours and staff rates) are complete and consistent. All line items are fully priced with RATE_TABLE method.
