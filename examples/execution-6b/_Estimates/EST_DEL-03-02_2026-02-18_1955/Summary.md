## Cost Drivers

DEL-03-02 is a single-discipline narrative deliverable. The sole cost driver is **Civil Engineer (Senior) hours** at 10 hours. The brief covers: parking design rationale, street access approach, surface drainage design, stormwater management, grading strategy, utility connections, and site servicing approach (noting cash allowance per Addendum 03).

The brief assumes the civil site concept (DEL-02-02) is already developed; this is not concept development time but rather the writing of rationale and design intent narrative.

## Warnings and Blockers

- **No warnings.** All line items are fully priced with source evidence.
- **No blockers to estimating.** Dependency evidence (18 rows) was reviewed; upstream prerequisites (DEL-02-02 concept, DEL-02-01 architectural concept, reference documents) are input dependencies for brief production, not for the estimate itself.
- **Cash allowance notation:** The civil design brief must reference the site servicing cash allowance per Addendum 03 (C-12). This is a content requirement, not a pricing line item for this deliverable. The cash allowance itself is priced elsewhere (DEL-01-04/DEL-01-05).
