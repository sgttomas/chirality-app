| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source/Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | The Civil Engineer (Senior) at R-07 rate ($155/hr CAD) is the sole resource required for DEL-03-02 production | Level_of_Effort.csv shows only one row for DEL-03-02 (R-07 at 10 hrs); no intermediate civil engineer or CAD technician hours allocated | If additional support resources are needed (e.g., intermediate civil engineer for calculations, CAD tech for figures), the estimate would increase. Potential underestimate risk is LOW given this is a narrative-only deliverable. |
| ASM-002 | 10 hours is sufficient for the Civil Design Brief narrative covering 7 RFP topics | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-03-02/R-07; basis labeled PARAMETRIC | If the brief requires more depth (e.g., detailed stormwater calculations, expanded drainage analysis), hours could increase. The brief assumes the concept (DEL-02-02) is already developed, so this is rationale writing, not concept development. |
| ASM-003 | The civil site concept (DEL-02-02) will be substantially complete before DEL-03-02 production begins | Dependencies.csv DEP-03-02-004; decomposition prerequisite | If the concept is not ready, the civil engineer may need additional coordination hours or rework. This is a production sequencing assumption, not a pricing assumption per se. |
| ASM-004 | Rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are current and applicable for proposal preparation phase | Rate table header: Basis = MARKET, Confidence = MEDIUM | If actual rates differ (e.g., negotiated rates, inflation adjustment), the total would change proportionally. |
