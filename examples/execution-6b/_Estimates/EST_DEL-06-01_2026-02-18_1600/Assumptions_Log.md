| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| EST-A-001 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are current and applicable to this proposal effort | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; all rates marked Basis = "MARKET", Confidence = "MEDIUM" | If actual rates differ, line-item amounts would change proportionally. R-03 at $165/hr and R-02 at $175/hr are the specific rates assumed. |
| EST-A-002 | Level of effort hours in Level_of_Effort.csv are a reasonable estimate of actual hours required to produce DEL-06-01 | Level_of_Effort.csv rows for DEL-06-01; Basis = "PARAMETRIC" | If actual hours differ, total cost changes linearly. R-03 at 10 hrs and R-02 at 4 hrs are the specific quantities assumed. |
| EST-A-003 | The scope of DEL-06-01 is limited to design methodology narrative content only (design approach, stakeholder engagement, review process, innovation/value) and does not include design documents plan content (milestones, coordination, QA/QC) which belongs to DEL-06-02 | INIT-TASK brief Cost Ownership Rules; Decomposition v2.3 FINAL: DEL-06-01 covers SOW-0008, DEL-06-02 covers SOW-0018 | If scope boundary is moved, hours and roles would need to be reallocated between DEL-06-01 and DEL-06-02. |
| EST-A-004 | No additional roles are required beyond Design Manager and Project Manager for this deliverable | Level_of_Effort.csv (only R-03 and R-02 listed for DEL-06-01) | If additional roles (e.g., Proposal Coordinator for editing) are needed, additional line items would be required. |
