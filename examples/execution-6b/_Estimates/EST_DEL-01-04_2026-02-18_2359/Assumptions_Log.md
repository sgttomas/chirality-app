| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong | Lines Affected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-01 | Main PSB building footprint is 18,000 sf (ground floor) | PP-05 from Assumed_Project_Parameters.csv; DESIGN_BASIS confidence MEDIUM | +/- 10% area change would shift all $/sf-based lines proportionally; ~$600k swing on base construction | B-110 thru B-670 (all main PSB $/sf lines) |
| ASM-02 | Cold storage building is 6,000 sf (60x100 ft) | PP-07; CONFIRMED confidence HIGH | Low risk -- confirmed in RFP | B-1000 |
| ASM-03 | Developed site area is 4.5 acres | PP-10; ASSUMPTION confidence MEDIUM | +/- 1 acre would shift earthwork and paving lines ~$150k | B-700 thru B-870 |
| ASM-04 | Apparatus/shop bays occupy ~12,000 sf (67% of main PSB) and office/admin areas occupy ~6,000 sf (33%) | Derived from functional program; 4 fire bays (2000-2200 sf each ~8,400 sf) + 4 PW bays (2000-2200 sf each ~8,400 sf) = ~16,800 sf bays but shared support reduces net bays to ~12,000 sf with ~6,000 sf office/admin | +/- 2000 sf shift between bays and office changes mechanical/electrical costs ~$50k | B-110, B-400 thru B-460, B-600 thru B-620 |
| ASM-05 | Screw pile foundation system (80 piles at 6m centres) | SC-14; based on Penhold soils from 2021 geotech report context; no additional investigation per DEC-013 | Spread footings would be ~$100k less; driven piles would be similar; deep foundations (if required by unexpected soil conditions) could add $100-200k | B-100 |
| ASM-06 | 8 overhead doors at 16x16 ft (4 fire + 4 PW) | PP-13; DERIVED from functional program; CONFIRMED height per Addendum 03 | Very low risk -- confirmed quantities | B-500 |
| ASM-07 | Fire protection (wet sprinkler) is required | Conservative assumption; AHJ determination may eliminate this requirement | If not required: $108k savings | B-420 |
| ASM-08 | Radiant in-floor heating in all apparatus/shop bays | Design assumption based on Alberta fire station practice | Unit heaters would be ~$50k less; radiant provides better performance for apparatus bays | B-400 (included in MS-14 component) |
| ASM-09 | 40 parking stalls for light vehicles | PP-19; ASSUMPTION confidence MEDIUM | +/- 10 stalls changes paving by ~$25k | B-810 |
| ASM-10 | 200 linear metres each for on-site water main, sanitary sewer, gas, power duct, and telecom | Assumed based on typical 4.5-acre site development with buildings centrally located | +/- 50 lm changes underground utility costs by ~$20-40k | B-900 thru B-950 |
| ASM-11 | Generator run time 72 hours (per PP-26) | CONFIRMED per Addendum 03 functional program; used to size fuel tank | Affects generator system sizing and cost indirectly | B-530 |
| ASM-12 | 12 yard lighting poles for Option 2 | PP-20; ASSUMPTION confidence LOW; depends on site layout | +/- 4 poles changes Option 2 by ~$30k | C-200 |
| ASM-13 | 10 controlled access zones for Option 3 | PP-28; ASSUMPTION confidence LOW | +/- 3 zones changes Option 3 by ~$10k | C-300 |
| ASM-14 | 16 security cameras for Option 4 | PP-29; ASSUMPTION confidence LOW | +/- 4 cameras minimal impact on system price | C-400 |
| ASM-15 | Perimeter wall area ~1,520 m2 (160m perimeter x 9.5m average height) | Geometric estimate based on 18,000 sf footprint (~160x110 ft) with ~40 ft bay ceiling height averaged with ~15 ft office areas | +/- 15% wall area changes envelope cost by ~$120k | B-200 thru B-250 |
| ASM-16 | Interior partition quantities (400 m2 rated + 300 m2 non-rated + 120 m2 wet) | Estimated based on typical institutional building program of this size | +/- 20% changes interior costs by ~$15-20k | B-300 |
| ASM-17 | Design fees at ~8-9% of construction value including coordination markup | Per ED-13; Alberta DB market practice | If design fees are 6-7% (lower end), savings of ~$100-150k | B-1100 |
