The estimate for DEL-05-02 (Structural Durability & Maintenance) is priced using the RATE_TABLE method: hours from Level_of_Effort.csv multiplied by hourly rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv.

## Totals

| Package | Deliverable | CBS | Amount (CAD) | Lines |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| PKG-005 | DEL-05-02 | DESIGN_SERVICES | $1,240 | 1 |

## Breakdown

| Role | RoleID | Hours | Rate (CAD/hr) | Amount (CAD) |

| Structural Engineer (Senior) | R-09 | 8 | $155 | $1,240 |
| | **Total** | **8** | | **$1,240** |

## Cost Drivers

The estimate for this deliverable is driven entirely by senior structural engineer hours to author the durability narrative. The scope covers:
- Corrosion protection for structural steel (apparatus bay and Cold Storage environments)
- Concrete durability (freeze-thaw resistance, chloride exposure from de-icing)
- Foundation longevity based on existing 2021 geotechnical report (no additional investigation per DEC-013)
- Slab-on-grade durability in bay areas including sump construction
- Structural element accessibility for inspection and maintenance

## Key Observations

1. **Single-role deliverable.** DEL-05-02 is estimated with only one role (R-09, Structural Engineer Senior). This is consistent with the deliverable type (narrative authored by the structural discipline lead) and with the level-of-effort table, which assigns no other roles to this deliverable.
2. **8 hours is within the typical range** for a focused technical narrative deliverable in a proposal context, comparable to DEL-05-03 (Mechanical Maintainability, 8 hrs) and DEL-05-04 (Electrical Maintainability, 8 hrs).
3. **No blockers identified.** All upstream dependencies (DEL-02-03 structural concept, geotechnical report, RFP 7.1.4, Addendum 03) are available as reference inputs for the narrative.

## Warnings

None.
