# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-02-02_2026-02-18_2100

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hourly rates in `Professional_Staff_Rates.csv` are valid for the proposal preparation period and represent market rates for Alberta-based professionals | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv `Basis=MARKET`, `Confidence=MEDIUM` | If rates are stale or below market, actual cost to deliver DEL-02-02 may exceed estimate. Impact: moderate (rates are the unit cost driver). |
| ASM-002 | Level of effort (56 total hours across 3 roles) is sufficient to produce a complete civil/site concept plan and narrative for a 12-acre site with the described scope | Level_of_Effort.csv rows for DEL-02-02; `Basis=PARAMETRIC` | If scope is more complex than assumed (e.g., multiple site layout options, extensive drainage modelling, iterative coordination cycles), additional hours would be required. Impact: moderate. |
| ASM-003 | A single site concept plan drawing plus civil narrative is the anticipated artifact set; no multiple option studies are costed | Decomposition DEL-02-02 description: "Site concept plan drawing; civil site narrative" | If the proposal team elects to present alternative site layouts, additional CAD and engineering hours would be needed. Impact: low-to-moderate. |
| ASM-004 | CAD production hours (16 hrs) assume use of existing base plans and templates, not starting from scratch | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-02-02/R-06 Notes: "Site plan drawing production" | If no base plan is available and production starts from raw survey/grading data, CAD hours could increase by 50-100%. Impact: moderate. |
| ASM-005 | The building footprint from DEL-02-01 will be provided in a timely manner per production sequencing (DEP-02-02-005); no rework due to late footprint changes is costed | Dependencies.csv DEP-02-02-005 | If the architectural concept changes significantly after the site plan is drafted, rework hours are not included in this estimate. Impact: moderate. |
