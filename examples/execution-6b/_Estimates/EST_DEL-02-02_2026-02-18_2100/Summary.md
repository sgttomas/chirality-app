## Deliverable Scope

DEL-02-02 produces the civil/site concept plan for the 12-acre developable area of the Penhold Public Services Building project. Artifacts include:
- Site concept plan drawing (building footprint placement, vehicular access, parking layout, internal circulation, surface drainage concept, grading approach, utility connection points, fire access routes, Cold Storage placement)
- Civil site narrative addressing site constraints from reference reports

**Package:** PKG-002 -- Conceptual Design
**Scope Items:** SOW-0009, SOW-0010
**Objective:** OBJ-003 -- Maximize Proposed Conceptual Design score (20 pts)

## Cost Ownership Boundaries

The following items are explicitly **in scope** for DEL-02-02:
- Civil/site concept plan drawing production
- Civil concept narrative (site constraints, drainage concept, grading approach)
- All civil engineering hours for the site concept

The following items are explicitly **out of scope** for DEL-02-02 (costed elsewhere):
- Architectural concept drawings and massing -- DEL-02-01
- Structural concept narrative -- DEL-02-03
- Mechanical concept narrative -- DEL-02-04
- Electrical/IT concept narrative -- DEL-02-05
- Civil design brief (rationale narrative) -- DEL-03-02
- Site conditions due diligence summary -- DEL-10-02

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers identified.** All pricing sources are present and sufficient.
- **Dependency note:** DEL-02-02 has a prerequisite on DEL-02-01 (building footprint dimensions and orientation) per DEP-02-02-005. This is a production sequencing dependency, not a pricing blocker.
- **Confidence:** All rates and hours are MEDIUM confidence, consistent with proposal-stage estimating.
