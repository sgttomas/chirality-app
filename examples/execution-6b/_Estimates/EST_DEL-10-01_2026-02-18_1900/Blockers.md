# Blocker Report -- EST_DEL-10-01_2026-02-18_1900

## Summary

No blockers affect pricing for this estimate. All line items are fully priced from basis evidence.

Four dependency rows identify content prerequisites with TBD locations (reference reports not directly accessed), but these are content dependencies for the risk register authoring process, not pricing dependencies for the estimate.
