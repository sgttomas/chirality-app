| **Rounding** | DOLLAR |
| **Fallback Policy** | STRICT (no fallback needed; all items priced from basis evidence) |
| **Mixed Methods** | FALSE (all lines = RATE_TABLE) |

## Deliverable Total

| WBS Package | WBS Deliverable | Description | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---|---:|
| PKG-010 | DEL-10-01 | Risk Register & Mitigation Plan | **$2,370** |

## Breakdown by CBS

| CBS | Role | Hours | Rate (CAD/HR) | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| PROF-PM | Project Manager (R-02) | 10 | $175 | $1,750 |
| PROF-CM | Construction Manager (R-15) | 4 | $155 | $620 |
| **Total** | | **14** | | **$2,370** |

## Key Observations

1. **Scope**: This estimate covers the proposal production cost to compile the risk register and write the mitigation plan narrative. It does NOT estimate the construction-phase risk contingency or risk-related costs in the project budget.

2. **Cost drivers**: PM hours dominate (74% of total) reflecting the cross-category risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategy writing. CM provides construction-specific risk input (26% of total).

3. **No blockers identified**: All upstream dependencies (source documents, decomposition) are available. DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions & Due Diligence Summary) is a prerequisite for site/environmental risk entries but does not block the estimate itself.

4. **Downstream interfaces**: Cost risk entries (RISK-CST-*) must reconcile with DEL-01-06 (Pricing Narrative & Assumptions). Schedule risk entries (RISK-SCH-*) must align with DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule). Construction risk entries must be consistent with DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology).

## Warnings

None. All line items are priced from basis evidence with full provenance.
