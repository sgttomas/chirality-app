# Assumptions Log — EST_DEL-02-01_2026-02-18_2000

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv reflect market rates applicable to this project | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM) | If actual firm rates are higher/lower, total cost scales proportionally. A +/-15% rate variance changes the total by approximately +/-$2,370. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-002 | Level of effort hours (132h total) in Level_of_Effort.csv are sufficient to produce the full architectural concept package including Addendum 03 requirements | Level_of_Effort.csv (Basis=PARAMETRIC) | If hours are underestimated (e.g., additional revision cycles, complex program integration), cost increases proportionally. The 60h CAD production allocation assumes ~3 revision cycles. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-003 | No additional rendering or visualization effort beyond concept-level drawings | Level_of_Effort.csv notes: "optional renderings" in description but no separate rendering line item | If client requires photorealistic renderings, additional specialist hours may be needed (estimated 16-24h at $95-$145/hr = $1,520-$3,480 additional). | MEDIUM |
| ASM-004 | Cross-discipline coordination (architect leading integration of inputs from DEL-02-02 through DEL-02-05) is covered within the R-04 Architect (Project) 40h allocation | Brief: "Cross-discipline COORDINATION hours -> DEL-02-01" | If coordination effort exceeds allocation due to iteration with discipline consultants, additional Project Architect hours may be required. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-005 | Addendum 03 program integration (16ft doors, 40 lockers, room sizes, 2nd storey option) does not require additional hours beyond those allocated | Level_of_Effort.csv notes mention "program integration" in R-04 allocation | Addendum 03 requirements are substantial. If integration analysis takes longer than planned, the 40h R-04 allocation may need to increase. | MEDIUM |
| ASM-006 | One concept design iteration (no major scope restart) | Implicit in parametric hour model | If the concept is rejected and requires a fundamentally different approach, hours could approximately double. | MEDIUM |
