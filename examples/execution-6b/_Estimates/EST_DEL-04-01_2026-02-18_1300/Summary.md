## Basis of Estimate Summary

This estimate prices the professional services hours required to produce the Building Envelope & Energy Strategy narrative deliverable (DEL-04-01) for the Penhold PSB proposal. The cost is composed of:

- **Building Science Consultant** (12 hours): Lead author for thermal performance targets, air barrier continuity approach, thermal bridging mitigation strategy, and energy code compliance pathway (NECB or equivalent). This is the primary cost driver for this deliverable.
- **Architect / Project** (4 hours): Coordination input on envelope design integration with the architectural concept, ensuring consistency between the energy strategy narrative and the architectural concept package (DEL-02-01).

Hours are sourced from `Level_of_Effort.csv` (DEL-04-01 rows). Rates are sourced from `Professional_Staff_Rates.csv`. All rates have MEDIUM confidence and are market-basis.

## Cost Ownership Boundary

DEL-04-01 covers ONLY the building envelope energy strategy portion of SOW-0012. Specifically:
- Wall, roof, and glazing thermal performance targets
- Air barrier continuity approach
- Thermal bridging mitigation
- Energy code compliance pathway (NECB or equivalent)
- Overall building energy philosophy and performance targets

The following are explicitly NOT in DEL-04-01 and are costed under their own deliverables:
- Mechanical energy efficiency and solar-ready provisions (DEL-04-02)
- Electrical energy efficiency and LED lighting controls (DEL-04-03)
- Architectural durability and maintenance (DEL-05-01)
- Architectural design brief (DEL-03-01)

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers identified.** All upstream dependencies (RFP, Addendum 03, architectural concept coordination) are available or in parallel production.
- **No TBD amounts.** All lines are fully priced.
- **Cross-discipline coordination hours** for sustainability integration between DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, and DEL-04-03 are included within the Building Science Consultant hours (per brief: cross-discipline coordination hours for sustainability belong in DEL-04-01).
