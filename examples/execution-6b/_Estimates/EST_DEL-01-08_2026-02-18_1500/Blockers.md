# Blockers Report — EST_DEL-01-08_2026-02-18_1500

## Summary

No pricing blockers identified. Two execution-sequencing prerequisites have TBD satisfaction status but do not prevent meaningful cost estimation.

## Upstream Prerequisites (Execution Sequencing)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | SatisfactionStatus | Pricing Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-01-08-004 | DEL-01-07 (Design-Build Firm Experience Profile) | PREREQUISITE | TBD | NONE — team composition input needed for execution but does not change the hours/rates for resume formatting work |
| DEP-01-08-005 | DEL-01-09 (Appendix I — Subtrade and Consultant List) | PREREQUISITE | TBD | NONE — preliminary draft needed for consistency verification but does not change the cost of resume compilation |

## Interface Dependencies

| DependencyID | Target | Type | SatisfactionStatus | Pricing Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-01-08-008 | DEL-01-09 (Appendix I) | INTERFACE | TBD | NONE — bidirectional consistency requirement; affects execution QA, not pricing |

## Downstream Handovers

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-01-08-007 | DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission Package) | HANDOVER | Completed resumes feed into final PDF assembly. No pricing impact on DEL-01-08. |

## Conclusion

All dependencies are execution-sequencing or traceability concerns. No information gaps prevent pricing. Estimate proceeds with full confidence in the pricing basis.
