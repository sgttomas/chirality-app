## Basis Used

- **Method:** RATE_TABLE applied consistently across all line items.
- **Hours source:** Level_of_Effort.csv (Execution=6b, DeliverableID=DEL-01-08). Hours basis in source file is PARAMETRIC but the pricing method applied here is RATE_TABLE (externally defined rates x externally defined quantities).
- **Rate source:** Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (RoleID matched). All rates are MARKET-based, MEDIUM confidence.
- **Fallback:** Not invoked. All line items have complete basis evidence.

## Key Warnings and Blockers

**Blockers from dependency evidence:**
- DEP-01-08-004: DEL-01-07 (Design-Build Firm Experience Profile) is an upstream prerequisite. Satisfaction status = TBD. This is not a pricing blocker but an execution sequencing dependency.
- DEP-01-08-005: DEL-01-09 (Appendix I — Subtrade and Consultant List) preliminary draft is an upstream prerequisite. Satisfaction status = TBD. Same — execution sequencing, not pricing.

**Warnings:** None. All line items are fully priced with complete provenance.
