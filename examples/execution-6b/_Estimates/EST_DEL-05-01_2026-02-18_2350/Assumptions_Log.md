# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-05-01_2026-02-18_2350

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | The 10-hour allocation for R-04 (Architect Project) includes all subtasks: cladding analysis, roofing lifecycle, interior finishes, flooring by zone, door/hardware durability, moisture management, and cross-discipline coordination with DEL-05-02/03/04. | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-05-01/R-04; Procedure.md Steps A1-A7 | If coordination or revisions require more hours, the estimate understates cost. Upside limited (narrative scope is bounded by RFP Section 7.1.4). |
| ASM-002 | No additional roles are required beyond R-04 (Architect Project) for DEL-05-01. | Level_of_Effort.csv contains only R-04 for DEL-05-01. | If a Building Science Consultant (R-27), CAD Technician (R-06), or Project Manager (R-02) review is required, those hours would need to be added. |
| ASM-003 | The $145/hr rate for R-04 is appropriate for the proposal preparation context and does not require escalation or premium adjustment. | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv row R-04; MARKET basis. | If actual rates differ (firm-specific, overtime, or market escalation), the cost changes proportionally. |
| ASM-004 | Rounding to nearest dollar has no material effect on this estimate. | ROUNDING=DOLLAR; Amount=1450 (already a whole number). | No impact. |
