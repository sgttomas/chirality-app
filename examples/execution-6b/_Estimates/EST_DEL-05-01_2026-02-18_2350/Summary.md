## Key Observations

1. DEL-05-01 is a narrative deliverable (Type: Durability / Narrative) produced by the Architect (Project) role. The entire cost is professional labour for writing the architectural durability and maintenance strategy.

2. The 10-hour allocation covers: exterior cladding selection rationale, roofing system lifecycle, interior finishes strategy for operations environments, flooring systems by zone, door and hardware durability (including 16 ft overhead doors), and moisture management at transitions and penetrations.

3. This deliverable covers ONLY the architectural discipline portion of SOW-0013. The structural (DEL-05-02), mechanical (DEL-05-03), and electrical (DEL-05-04) portions are estimated separately.

4. DEL-05-01 has coordination interfaces with DEL-05-02, DEL-05-03, and DEL-05-04 (per Dependencies.csv). The coordination effort is embedded within the 10-hour allocation (no separate coordination line item in the LoE source).
