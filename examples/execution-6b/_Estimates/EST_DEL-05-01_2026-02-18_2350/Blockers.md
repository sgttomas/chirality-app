| DependencyID | Target | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-01-004 | DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept Package) | SatisfactionStatus=TBD | Does NOT block pricing. The estimate prices the production effort (hours to write the narrative). The dependency is an execution-sequencing concern: DEL-05-01 needs DEL-02-01 material selections as input content, but the effort to write the narrative is independent of whether that input is ready yet. |
