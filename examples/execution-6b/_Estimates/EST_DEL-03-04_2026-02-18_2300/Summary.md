## Cost Summary

| CBS | Description | Hours | Rate (CAD/hr) | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| PROF_SERVICES_DESIGN | Mechanical Engineer (Senior) -- R-11 | 10 | 160 | 1,600 |
| | **TOTAL** | **10** | | **$1,600** |

## Cost Drivers

- **Primary driver:** Senior mechanical engineer hours (10 hrs) -- this is a single-author narrative deliverable.
- **Scope:** Mechanical design brief per RFP Section 7.1.2(4) covering HVAC system selection rationale, heating/cooling approach, ventilation strategy by zone, plumbing systems approach, fire protection strategy, and generator/emergency power philosophy.
- **Cost ownership boundary:** DEL-03-04 covers the mechanical design brief narrative only. Energy efficiency rationale is excluded (covered in DEL-04-02). Lifecycle/maintainability detail is excluded (covered in DEL-05-03). Mechanical concept narrative is a separate deliverable (DEL-02-04).

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers identified for pricing.** All pricing inputs (hours and rates) are available and sourced.
- **Dependency note:** DEL-03-04 has 5 upstream prerequisite deliverables (DEL-02-04, DEL-02-01, DEL-02-03, DEL-02-02, DEL-02-05) that must be at least in draft form before the mechanical design brief can be authored. These dependencies affect scheduling but not pricing.
