# Assumptions Log

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | The mechanical design brief is authored entirely by one senior mechanical engineer with no supporting staff | Level_of_Effort.csv assigns only R-11 to DEL-03-04; no intermediate or technician hours are listed | If the brief requires coordination input or drafting support from an intermediate engineer, actual cost could increase by 30-50% (est. 4-6 additional hours at $130/hr) |
| ASM-002 | 10 hours is sufficient for the mechanical design brief scope | Level_of_Effort.csv row for DEL-03-04; scope includes HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, and generator/emergency power philosophy | If the brief scope is more extensive than anticipated (e.g., detailed system comparisons, multiple option analyses), hours could increase. 10 hours assumes a focused narrative without detailed calculations. |
| ASM-003 | Upstream concept deliverables (DEL-02-01 through DEL-02-05) are available in draft form before DEL-03-04 is started | Dependencies.csv DEP-03-04-004 through DEP-03-04-008 | If concept deliverables are not available, the mechanical engineer may require additional hours for research and iteration. This assumption affects schedule risk, not the rate-based pricing. |
| ASM-004 | The rate of $160/hr CAD for Senior Mechanical Engineer is representative of the project's actual cost | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv R-11; MARKET basis; MEDIUM confidence | Actual rates vary by firm, region, and contract terms. A +/- 15% rate variance would shift the total by approximately +/- $240. |
