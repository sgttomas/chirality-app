# Blocker Report -- DEL-03-04 Mechanical Design Brief

## Summary

No pricing blockers identified. All required inputs (hours and rates) are available from designated price sources.

## Dependency-Based Readiness Assessment

The following upstream dependencies from Dependencies.csv were reviewed for their impact on estimate readiness:

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-04-004 | DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | **Schedule dependency only.** Brief explains concept decisions; does not affect pricing inputs. Concept must be drafted before brief authoring begins. |
| DEP-03-04-005 | DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept Plan) | PREREQUISITE | **Schedule dependency only.** Bay layout and room locations inform the brief narrative but do not change hours or rates. |
| DEP-03-04-006 | DEL-02-03 (Structural Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | **Schedule dependency only.** Slab design for sumps informs brief content but does not affect pricing. |
| DEP-03-04-007 | DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan) | PREREQUISITE | **Schedule dependency only.** Utility connections inform brief content but do not affect pricing. |
| DEP-03-04-008 | DEL-02-05 (Electrical/IT Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | **Schedule dependency only.** Generator integration informs brief content but does not affect pricing. |
| DEP-03-04-009 | DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy & Solar Readiness) | INTERFACE | **Scope boundary.** Energy efficiency rationale excluded from DEL-03-04; no pricing impact. |
| DEP-03-04-010 | DEL-05-03 (Mechanical Maintainability) | INTERFACE | **Scope boundary.** Lifecycle detail excluded from DEL-03-04; no pricing impact. |
| DEP-03-04-016 | Addendum 03 | CONSTRAINT | **Compliance constraint.** Seven mechanical clarifications (M-001 through M-007) must be addressed. Hours assume compliance is built into the 10-hour effort. |

## Conclusion

All dependencies are either schedule-related prerequisites (do not affect pricing) or scope-boundary interfaces (clarify what is included/excluded). No unresolved inputs block meaningful pricing for DEL-03-04.
