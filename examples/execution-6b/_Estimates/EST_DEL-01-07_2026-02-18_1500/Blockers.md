- **PENDING external prerequisites (production blockers, not estimating blockers):** 2
- **Total dependency rows reviewed:** 11

## PENDING External Prerequisites

These are inputs needed to PRODUCE the deliverable content, not to estimate its cost. The estimate is based on the hours and rates required regardless of whether these inputs have been received yet.

| DependencyID | Target | Status | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-0107-E006 | Firm Project Portfolio (Historical Records / PM Database) | PENDING | None on cost estimate; needed for content production |
| DEP-0107-E007 | Client Reference Contacts (Firm CRM / Business Development) | PENDING | None on cost estimate; needed for content production |

## Internal Deliverable Dependencies (Not Blocking Estimate)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-0107-E001 | DEL-01-09 (Appendix I — Subtrade List) | INTERFACE | Firm names must align; coordination dependency |
| DEP-0107-E002 | DEL-01-08 (Key Team Members & Resumes) | INTERFACE | Personnel names must match; coordination dependency |
| DEP-0107-E003 | DEL-01-02 (Formal Submission Package) | HANDOVER (downstream) | DEL-01-07 hands off to PDF assembly |

## Assessment

No dependency prevents meaningful cost estimation. The level-of-effort hours are driven by the writing and review task scope, which is well-defined regardless of the specific firm portfolio content.
