# Estimate Summary -- DEL-09-01 Detailed Project Schedule

## Basis of Estimate

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **BASIS_OF_ESTIMATE** | RATE_TABLE |
| **Method** | Hours from Level_of_Effort.csv multiplied by hourly rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv |
| **Currency** | CAD |
| **Rounding** | DOLLAR |
| **Fallback Used** | None (STRICT; no fallback needed) |
| **Mixed Methods** | None (all line items use RATE_TABLE) |

## Deliverable Description

DEL-09-01 -- Detailed Project Schedule per RFP Section 7.1.9: Gantt chart format, key work packages from design through construction substantial performance and close-out, all milestone dates, critical path identified and narrated, schedule assumptions stated. Covers SOW-0025; supports OBJ-009.

## Totals by CBS

| CBS | Amount (CAD) | Line Count | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| LABOUR.CONST | $3,220 | 2 | Scheduler (20h) + Construction Manager (4h) |
| LABOUR.MGMT | $1,400 | 1 | Project Manager (8h) |
| **TOTAL** | **$4,620** | **3** | |

## Totals by Role

| RoleID | Role | Hours | Rate (CAD/hr) | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| R-17 | Scheduler | 20 | $130 | $2,600 |
| R-02 | Project Manager | 8 | $175 | $1,400 |
| R-15 | Construction Manager | 4 | $155 | $620 |
| | **TOTAL** | **32** | | **$4,620** |

## Key Observations

1. **Primary cost driver:** The Scheduler (R-17) accounts for 56% of the total cost ($2,600 of $4,620), reflecting the hands-on Gantt chart production and CPM analysis work.
2. **Project Manager review:** PM hours (8h) include milestone validation, coordination with DEL-06-02 (design milestones) and DEL-08-01 (commissioning milestones), and schedule assumptions review.
3. **Construction Manager input:** Limited CM hours (4h) provide construction sequencing input to ensure the schedule reflects buildable phasing.
4. **Scheduling software costs:** Per the brief's BOE context, scheduling software costs are embedded in the hourly rate (PS-10 convention per INDEX.md) -- no separate software line item required.
5. **No blockers:** All execution dependencies are production-workflow concerns, not pricing blockers.

## Warnings

None.

## Blockers

None affecting estimation. See `Blockers.md` for execution dependency detail.
