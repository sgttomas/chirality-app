# Blockers Report -- DEL-09-01

## Summary

**Blocking dependencies for estimating: 0**
**Execution dependencies with TBD satisfaction (non-blocking for estimate): 5**

## Execution Dependencies (Information Only)

The following execution dependencies are noted in Dependencies.csv. They affect production readiness for the deliverable itself but do NOT block pricing because the estimate is based on professional labour hours (from Level_of_Effort.csv) and rates (from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv), not on quantities derived from upstream deliverables.

| DependencyID | Target | Type | SatisfactionStatus | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-09-01-E001 | DEL-06-02 (Design & Construction Docs Plan) | PREREQUISITE | TBD | None -- hours are fixed in Level_of_Effort.csv regardless of milestone dates content |
| DEP-09-01-E002 | DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative) | INTERFACE | TBD | None -- hours are fixed; construction sequencing consistency is a production concern |
| DEP-09-01-E003 | DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Training Closeout) | PREREQUISITE | TBD | None -- hours are fixed; commissioning milestone dates are a production concern |
| DEP-09-01-E004 | DEL-10-02 (Site Conditions & Due Diligence) | INTERFACE | TBD | None -- hours are fixed; site constraint assumptions are a production concern |
| DEP-09-01-E005 | RFP Section 7.1.9 | PREREQUISITE | SATISFIED | None -- source document available |
| DEP-09-01-E006 | RFP Section 7.1.8 | PREREQUISITE | SATISFIED | None -- source document available |
| DEP-09-01-E007 | Addendum 03 | PREREQUISITE | SATISFIED | None -- source document available |
| DEP-09-01-E008 | Site Reference Reports | PREREQUISITE | TBD | None -- hours are fixed; report accessibility is a production concern |
| DEP-09-01-E009 | CCDC 14-2013 with Appendix J | PREREQUISITE | TBD | None -- hours are fixed; contract framework is a production concern |

## Conclusion

No blockers prevent estimation. The estimate for DEL-09-01 is based on pre-defined professional staff hours and rates. Execution dependencies affect the deliverable's production workflow, not its cost estimation.
