# Blockers Report -- DEL-03-05 Electrical/IT Design Brief

**RunID:** EST_DEL-03-05_2026-02-18_2330
**Source:** Dependencies.csv (10 rows)

## Summary

**No blockers identified for estimating purposes.**

All upstream dependencies are information prerequisites that affect the content and sequencing of the deliverable's production, not the cost estimate. The hours and rates are independent of whether upstream deliverables are complete.

## Dependency Inventory (from Dependencies.csv)

### Upstream Prerequisites (affect content, not cost)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-05-003 | DEL-02-05 (Electrical/IT Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | None -- concept narrative informs brief content, not authoring hours |
| DEP-03-05-004 | DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept Package) | PREREQUISITE | None -- roof orientation for solar-readiness informs brief content, not authoring hours |
| DEP-03-05-005 | DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | None -- generator sizing / HVAC controls integration informs brief content, not authoring hours |

### Upstream Constraints (binding requirements)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-05-006 | Addendum 03 (ss1.6, 1.7, 1.15, 1.17) | CONSTRAINT | None -- binding requirements define scope; hours already account for addendum compliance |
| DEP-03-05-007 | RFP Appendix B (Functional Program) | PREREQUISITE | None -- program data is available; no additional cost |

### Upstream Interfaces (cross-check only)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-05-008 | DEL-03-04 (Mechanical Design Brief) | INTERFACE | None -- cross-check effort included in the 10 allocated hours |

### Downstream Handovers (not cost-bearing for DEL-03-05)

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-05-009 | DEL-04-03 (Electrical Energy Efficiency) | HANDOVER | None -- downstream consumer; costed under PKG-004 |
| DEP-03-05-010 | DEL-05-04 (Electrical Maintainability) | HANDOVER | None -- downstream consumer; costed under PKG-005 |

### Anchor Rows (traceability only)

| DependencyID | Target | Type |
|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-05-001 | SOW-0011 | IMPLEMENTS_NODE |
| DEP-03-05-002 | OBJ-004 | TRACES_TO_REQUIREMENT |
