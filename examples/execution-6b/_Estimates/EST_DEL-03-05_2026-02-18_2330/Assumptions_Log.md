**RunID:** EST_DEL-03-05_2026-02-18_2330

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| EST-A-001 | The 10 hours allocated in Level_of_Effort.csv for DEL-03-05 (Electrical Engineer, Senior) are sufficient to author the electrical/IT design brief covering all 7 topic areas (power distribution, lighting, controls, telecom/data, access control/security, fire alarm, solar-readiness) | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-03-05/R-13; basis=PARAMETRIC | If the design brief requires more depth than typical proposal-stage narrative, hours could increase. Each additional hour = $155 CAD. |
| EST-A-002 | No intermediate electrical engineer support is needed for the design brief narrative | Level_of_Effort.csv (no R-14 row for DEL-03-05) | If intermediate support is needed for calculations, equipment research, or drawing coordination, cost would increase. R-14 rate = $125/hr. |
| EST-A-003 | The senior EE rate of $155/hr CAD reflects market conditions for Alberta consulting engineers on municipal facility projects | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv row R-13; basis=MARKET; confidence=MEDIUM | If actual negotiated rates differ, the estimate would need adjustment. |
| EST-A-004 | The design brief narrative is a standalone authoring task that does not require paid coordination meetings beyond what is captured in the 10-hour allocation | Level_of_Effort.csv; no coordination overhead line items for DEL-03-05 | If formal coordination meetings with the architect (DEL-02-01), mechanical engineer (DEL-02-04 / DEL-03-04), or project manager are billed separately, costs would increase. |
| EST-A-005 | Cross-check effort with DEL-03-04 (Mechanical Design Brief) per DEP-03-05-008 is included within the 10-hour allocation | Level_of_Effort.csv allocation includes integration review time | If extensive coordination is required (e.g., generator sizing disputes, HVAC controls integration complexity), additional hours may be needed. |
