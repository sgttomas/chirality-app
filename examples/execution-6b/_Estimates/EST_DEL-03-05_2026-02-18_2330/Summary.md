- **Quantity source:** Level_of_Effort.csv (parametric hours by deliverable/role, filtered to DEL-03-05 rows)
- **Fallback policy:** STRICT (no fallback pricing used; all items priced from basis evidence)
- **Mixed methods:** FALSE (all lines use RATE_TABLE method)

## Scope Coverage

- **In scope:** DEL-03-05 (Electrical/IT Design Brief)
- **Excluded:** None (single-deliverable scope)
- **Blocked:** None

## Cost Drivers Addressed

The estimate covers the professional service hours to PRODUCE the electrical/IT design brief narrative, including:
- Power distribution philosophy
- Lighting design approach (LED per IES recommendations)
- Building controls strategy
- Telecommunications/data infrastructure
- Access control and security system design approach
- Fire alarm system
- Solar-readiness provisions (per Addendum 03)

This deliverable is priced with a single senior electrical engineer role at 10 hours. The Level_of_Effort.csv assigns only R-13 (Electrical Engineer, Senior) to DEL-03-05, reflecting that design brief narratives at proposal stage are typically authored by the discipline lead without intermediate-level support (unlike the concept narrative DEL-02-05 which includes R-14 intermediate support for load calculations and equipment research).

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- No warnings. All line items priced from basis evidence.
- No blockers identified for estimating purposes.
- Dependency evidence shows 3 upstream prerequisites (DEL-02-05, DEL-02-01, DEL-02-04) and 1 interface (DEL-03-04) -- these affect content production sequencing but not the cost estimate.
- 2 downstream handovers (DEL-04-03, DEL-05-04) -- these are consuming deliverables; their costs are estimated separately.

## Comparison Context (Sibling Design Brief Deliverables)

For reference, Level_of_Effort.csv allocates the following hours to design brief deliverables within PKG-003:

| Deliverable | Role | Hours | Rate | Amount |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DEL-03-01 Architectural Design Brief | R-04 Architect (Project) | 12 | $145 | $1,740 |
| DEL-03-02 Civil Design Brief | R-07 Civil Engineer (Senior) | 10 | $155 | $1,550 |
| DEL-03-03 Structural Design Brief | R-09 Structural Engineer (Senior) | 10 | $155 | $1,550 |
| DEL-03-04 Mechanical Design Brief | R-11 Mechanical Engineer (Senior) | 10 | $160 | $1,600 |
| **DEL-03-05 Electrical/IT Design Brief** | **R-13 Electrical Engineer (Senior)** | **10** | **$155** | **$1,550** |
| DEL-03-06 Accessibility & Adaptability | R-04 Architect (Project) | 8 | $145 | $1,160 |

DEL-03-05 is consistent with the 10-hour allocation pattern for engineering discipline design briefs (DEL-03-02 through DEL-03-05).
