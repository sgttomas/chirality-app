## Key Observations

1. DEL-03-06 is a single-role deliverable: only the Architect (Project) is assigned hours. This reflects the cross-discipline coordination role where the Architect synthesizes structural/mechanical input into the accessibility and adaptability narrative.

2. The 8-hour allocation covers both the accessibility narrative (SOW-0015: Alberta Building Code compliance, universal design) and the adaptability narrative (SOW-0014: future growth, structural expansion provisions, flexible space planning).

3. No blockers prevent pricing. Three upstream deliverable dependencies (DEL-03-03, DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02) and two interface dependencies (DEL-03-04, DEL-03-05) are at PENDING status, but these affect content production, not estimate pricing.
