## Key Observations

1. DEL-04-03 is a proposal-stage narrative deliverable covering electrical energy efficiency for the Penhold PSB project.
2. The scope is authored entirely by one role (Electrical Engineer, Senior) at 8 hours -- consistent with the nature of a focused discipline narrative within a sustainability package.
3. Cost drivers per the brief: LED lighting controls, motor efficiency standards, solar-ready electrical provisions (conduit, panel space, inverter location per Addendum 03), and metering/sub-metering strategy.
4. Cost ownership boundaries respected: solar-ready ELECTRICAL provisions are costed here in DEL-04-03 (not in DEL-02-05 concept or DEL-05-04 maintainability).

## Blockers and Warnings

- No pricing blockers identified.
- Dependencies exist on DEL-02-05, DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02 (upstream prerequisites) but these are production sequencing constraints, not pricing blockers. The level of effort is independent of whether upstream deliverables are complete at estimate time.
