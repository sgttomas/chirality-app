| AssumptionID | Assumption | Impact if Wrong | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| EASM-001 | PM effort (8 hours) is sufficient to identify all required subtrades and consultants, conduct outreach, and complete the Appendix I form | If more subtrades/consultants are needed than anticipated or outreach is more complex, hours could increase by 50-100%. Impact: +$700-$1,400. | Level_of_Effort.csv (R-02 / DEL-01-09); PARAMETRIC basis per source |
| EASM-002 | Administrative effort (4 hours) is sufficient for contact coordination and form formatting | If form requires extensive formatting, multiple revision cycles, or contact details are difficult to obtain, hours could increase. Impact: +$160-$320. | Level_of_Effort.csv (R-24 / DEL-01-09); PARAMETRIC basis per source |
| EASM-003 | Hourly rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are appropriate for the proposal preparation context | Rates are MARKET-basis, MEDIUM confidence. If actual staff rates differ, total would scale proportionally. | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; all rates at MEDIUM confidence |
| EASM-004 | No additional roles beyond PM and Admin are needed for this deliverable | If senior leadership review or specialist input is required for subtrade selection, additional hours at higher rates would be needed. | Level_of_Effort.csv scope for DEL-01-09 |
| EASM-005 | The subtrade/consultant list can be completed using existing firm relationships and standard outreach without procurement fees or subtrade engagement costs | Estimate covers only internal staff time. If external procurement support or subtrade pre-qualification activities are needed, those costs are excluded. | Scope boundary per INIT-TASK brief |
