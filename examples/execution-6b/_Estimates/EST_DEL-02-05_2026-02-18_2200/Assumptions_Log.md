| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| EST-A-001 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv are representative market rates for Alberta-based professional staff in 2024-2026 | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; Basis=MARKET; Confidence=MEDIUM | If actual rates differ, total amount scales proportionally. A 10% rate variance on DEL-02-05 = ~$348 impact. |
| EST-A-002 | Level of effort hours (16 Sr + 8 Int = 24 total) are sufficient to produce the Electrical/IT Concept Narrative | Level_of_Effort.csv; Basis=PARAMETRIC; Confidence implied MEDIUM | If scope proves more complex (e.g., extensive solar analysis, detailed security system specification), hours may increase. Each additional senior hour = $155; each additional intermediate hour = $125. |
| EST-A-003 | The estimate covers proposal production cost only; it does not include construction cost for electrical/IT systems | Scope definition from brief and decomposition: DEL-02-05 is a narrative deliverable within a proposal response | If construction estimating is expected, this snapshot would be materially incomplete. The brief explicitly states this is a proposal-production cost estimate. |
| EST-A-004 | Two roles are sufficient for the narrative (Senior EE lead + Intermediate EE support) | Level_of_Effort.csv rows for DEL-02-05 list exactly 2 roles | If additional roles are needed (e.g., IT specialist, security consultant), the estimate would need additional line items not present in the current price sources. |
