## Upstream Dependencies (informational, not blocking estimate)

The following upstream dependencies from `Dependencies.csv` affect content production sequencing for DEL-02-05 but do not block the cost estimate:

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Impact on Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-0205-E01 | DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept Package) | PREREQUISITE | Floor plans needed for zone layout, MER location, roof orientation. Does not affect hours estimate. |
| DEP-0205-E02 | DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | Generator specs and fill station locations needed. Does not affect hours estimate. |
| DEP-0205-E03 | DEL-02-02 (Civil/Site Concept Plan) | INTERFACE | Utility entry points needed for service entry design. Does not affect hours estimate. |
| DEP-0205-E04 | DEL-02-03 (Structural Concept Narrative) | INTERFACE | Roof loading concept for solar provisions. Does not affect hours estimate. |

These dependencies may affect the **schedule** for producing DEL-02-05 content, but the **cost** to produce the narrative (24 hours of electrical engineering labour) is independent of the production sequence.
