# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-10-02_2026-02-18_1900

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Hours in Level_of_Effort.csv (8 PM, 6 Civil Sr, 4 Geotech) are sufficient to produce the site conditions summary narrative | Level_of_Effort.csv rows for DEL-10-02 (Basis=PARAMETRIC) | If reference reports are more complex than anticipated, hours could increase. Risk is low for a summary-of-existing-studies deliverable. |
| ASM-002 | Hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv reflect current market rates for Alberta-based professional services | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM) | Rates may vary by firm; actual proposal rates would need to be confirmed with the proposing Design-Build team. |
| ASM-003 | No additional geotechnical investigation is required (per DEC-013) | Decomposition DEC-013 | If additional investigation is later deemed necessary, a separate cost item would need to be added (not in this deliverable's scope per cost ownership rules). |
| ASM-004 | Survey approach section (SOW-0026) requires no additional specialist hours beyond the PM allocation | Level_of_Effort.csv; Addendum 03 (survey files provided after award) | Survey approach is a brief assumptions statement rather than a technical survey scope definition. PM hours cover this. |
