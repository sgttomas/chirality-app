## Basis of Estimate Used

- **Method:** RATE_TABLE (all 3 line items)
- **Hours source:** Level_of_Effort.csv -- rows filtered to Execution=6b, DeliverableID=DEL-10-02
- **Rate source:** Professional_Staff_Rates.csv -- matched by RoleID
- **Computation:** Amount = Hours x HourlyRate_CAD for each role, rounded to DOLLAR
- **No mixed methods.** All line items use RATE_TABLE. No fallback was required.

## Key Observations

1. **Low-cost narrative deliverable.** 18 total hours across 3 roles reflects a summary/synthesis task rather than original design work. The PM drives the narrative; the civil engineer and geotechnical engineer provide targeted technical review.

2. **Cost drivers confirmed.** The brief identified PM + technical lead hours as the primary cost drivers. The LoE data assigns 8 hrs PM, 6 hrs civil, and 4 hrs geotech -- consistent with a deliverable that summarizes existing reference reports (geotech, wetland, environmental, flood zone, site grading) without commissioning new investigations (per DEC-013).

3. **No blockers to estimating.** While the deliverable itself has 4 BLOCKING upstream document prerequisites (geotech report, wetland assessment, environmental assessment, flood zone mapping), these are blockers to *producing* the deliverable content, not to *estimating its cost*. The hours required to summarize these reports are well-defined regardless of whether the reports have been read yet.
