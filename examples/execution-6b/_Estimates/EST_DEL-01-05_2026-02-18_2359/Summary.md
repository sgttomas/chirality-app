## Schedule B vs Schedule A Discipline Cross-Check

## Key Notes

1. **Schedule B provides sub-item detail** that Schedule A summarizes. The additional detail in Schedule B includes: separate sub-items for each option (e.g., wash bay broken into system + plumbing + environmental), and separate lines for security monitoring service (annual subscription shown as distinct from camera system capital cost per Specification requirement).
2. **FF&E ($20,000) is NOT in base cost** -- listed only as Additional Item 6 per C-11 / Addendum 03 / DEC-012.
3. **Security monitoring ($5,000/yr) shown as separate sub-line** within Additional Item 4 per deliverable Specification requirement.
4. **Bond and insurance costs** are in General Requirements (Schedule B Section 1), consistent with DEL-01-03 scope. CCIP insurance per DEC-011.
5. **Municipal utility tie-in allowance ($35,000)** is a cash allowance per C-12 / Addendum 03.
6. **DB margin, contingency, and escalation are NOT included** -- these are commercial decisions outside ESTIMATING scope.
7. **Production cost ($6,020)** represents the effort to compile the detailed Schedule B form, not construction content.

## Key Warnings

1. **Mixed methods:** Detail.csv contains RATE_TABLE (90 lines), PARAMETRIC (1 line -- cold storage PEMB), and ALLOWANCE (4 lines -- workshop equipment, utility connection fees, municipal tie-in, FF&E).
2. **Fire protection (B-BLD-420):** $108,000 at LOW confidence -- sprinkler requirement pending AHJ.
3. **Generator system (B-BLD-530):** $150,000 at LOW confidence -- final load calculations pending.
4. **CCIP insurance (B-GR-130):** $240,000 at LOW confidence -- actual rate depends on insurer.
5. **Pricing narrative** (DEL-01-06) must document Schedule B assumptions; this estimate produces content but DEL-01-06 provides the narrative wrapper.
