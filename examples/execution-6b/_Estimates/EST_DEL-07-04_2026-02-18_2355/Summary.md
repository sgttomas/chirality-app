## Key Observations

1. **Single-role deliverable.** Only the Project Manager (R-02) is assigned to DEL-07-04 in the Level_of_Effort table, with 6 hours. No Construction Manager (R-15) hours are assigned despite the decomposition listing PM / Construction Manager as responsible parties.

2. **Smallest PKG-007 deliverable.** At 6 hours / $1,050, DEL-07-04 is the lowest-effort deliverable in PKG-007. For comparison, DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology) has 16 hours across two roles.

3. **No blockers from dependencies.** All upstream dependencies (DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-07-03, DEL-09-01) are interface/prerequisite relationships for content alignment; none block the cost estimate itself.

## Warnings

- [WARNING] Decomposition lists "PM / Construction Manager" as responsible parties, but Level_of_Effort.csv assigns only PM hours. If Construction Manager input is expected, hours may be understated. See Assumptions_Log.md ASM-002.
