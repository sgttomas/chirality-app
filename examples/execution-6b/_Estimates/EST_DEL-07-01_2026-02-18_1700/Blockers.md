# Blockers Report -- EST_DEL-07-01_2026-02-18_1700

## Summary

**No blockers to estimating identified.**

The dependency register for DEL-07-01 contains 15 rows. These describe execution-order constraints for content production (e.g., the construction methodology narrative needs the site plan from DEL-02-02 to describe staging logistics). However, none of these dependencies affect the ability to estimate the cost of producing DEL-07-01 itself.
