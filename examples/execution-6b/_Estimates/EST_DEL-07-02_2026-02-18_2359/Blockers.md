## Summary

| Metric | Value |

| Blocking estimate production | 0 |
| Informational only | 1 |

## Unresolved Constraints

### DEP-07-02-007 -- CCDC 14-2013 + Appendix J (Supplementary Conditions)

- **Status:** PENDING
- **Impact on estimate:** NONE (does not affect hours or rates for narrative authoring)
- **Impact on deliverable production:** YES -- Procedure.md indicates that superintendent authority, RFI turnaround, and change order threshold parameters from CCDC 14-2013 + Appendix J are TBD pending document review. These must be resolved before the narrative is finalized.
- **Evidence:** Dependencies.csv DEP-07-02-007; Procedure.md Prerequisites
- **Recommendation:** Resolve CCDC 14-2013 / Appendix J parameter extraction before narrative authoring begins. This is a content dependency, not a cost dependency.

## Prerequisite Status

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-07-02-004 | DEL-07-01 (Construction Methodology Narrative) | PREREQUISITE | ACTIVE (not yet confirmed complete) | None -- DEL-07-02 hours are independent of DEL-07-01 completion; however, narrative quality depends on framework alignment |
| DEP-07-02-005 | DEL-07-04 (Meetings & Reporting Narrative) | INTERFACE | ACTIVE | None -- interface coordination; does not affect estimate |
| DEP-07-02-006 | DEL-07-05 (Quality Management Narrative) | INTERFACE | ACTIVE | None -- documentation format alignment; does not affect estimate |

## Conclusion

No dependencies are blocking estimate production. The single PENDING constraint (CCDC 14-2013 parameter extraction) affects deliverable content but not the cost of producing the narrative. The estimate can proceed with full confidence.
