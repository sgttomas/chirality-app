# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-07-02_2026-02-18_2359

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | The 8 hours of Construction Manager time (R-15) in Level_of_Effort.csv covers the complete scope of DEL-07-02 narrative authoring, including all sub-topics: on-site supervision approach, document management, shop drawing review, cleaning, transport/storage, and site services. | S-02 (Level_of_Effort.csv, row 55); BOE Context from invoker confirms these sub-topics are cost drivers | If additional roles are needed (e.g., Proposal Coordinator for editing, PM for review), the estimate would increase. Current scope assumes Construction Manager self-authors with no dedicated review/editing support. |
| ASM-002 | The $155/hr rate for Construction Manager (R-15) is current and applicable for this engagement. | S-01 (Professional_Staff_Rates.csv, row 16); Basis = MARKET; Confidence = MEDIUM | If actual rates differ from market assumption, the total would scale proportionally. A +/- 10% rate variance = +/- $124. |
| ASM-003 | No revision cycles requiring additional hours are included in the 8-hour estimate. | Implicit in LOE single-row allocation | If revision cycles (PM review, coordination with DEL-07-01/07-04/07-05) add hours, the estimate would increase. Typical revision overhead for a narrative is 20-30% (1.6-2.4 additional hours). |
| ASM-004 | DEL-07-02 is a proposal-phase narrative document only. The estimate covers the cost of *writing about* construction administration, not the cost of *performing* construction administration during the construction phase. | Decomposition (Type: Construction / Narrative; context is proposal preparation) | No impact -- this is a definitional clarification, not a risk. Actual construction-phase administration costs would be estimated under PKG-001 pricing deliverables. |
