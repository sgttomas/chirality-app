## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No warnings.** All inputs resolved; all line items fully priced.
- **No blockers to estimate production.** One content dependency (CCDC 14-2013 parameter extraction, DEP-07-02-007) is PENDING but does not affect cost.
- **Single-role allocation:** The Level_of_Effort.csv assigns only Construction Manager hours to DEL-07-02. If PM review, proposal editing, or administrative support hours are expected, they are not captured in current sources and would increase the estimate.

## Context Notes

DEL-07-02 is a **proposal-phase narrative** covering construction administration approach per RFP Section 7.3. It is authored by the Construction Manager (R-15) and describes how the team will handle on-site supervision, document management, shop drawing review, cleaning, transport/storage, and site services coordination. This estimate covers the cost of **writing the narrative**, not the cost of performing construction administration during the actual construction phase.

The estimate for DEL-07-02 ($1,240) represents one of five deliverables in PKG-007. For the full package cost, combine with estimates for DEL-07-01, DEL-07-03, DEL-07-04, and DEL-07-05.
