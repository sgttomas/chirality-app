## Basis of Estimate Summary

This estimate prices the professional services hours required to PRODUCE the structural concept narrative for the Penhold Public Services Building proposal (DEL-02-03). The deliverable covers:

- Structural system selection (main building and Cold Storage)
- Foundation approach based on existing 2021 geotechnical investigation report only (no additional investigation per DEC-013)
- Framing system selection rationale
- Floor slab design including bay sumps per Addendum 03
- Structural provisions for future expansion
- Load considerations for apparatus bays and equipment

**Method:** Hours from Level_of_Effort.csv multiplied by rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv. Both sources carry MEDIUM confidence. No fallback pricing was required; all line items are priced from basis evidence.

## Cost Drivers

- Senior structural engineer hours (67% of cost): drives narrative quality and technical credibility for a 20-point evaluation criterion (OBJ-003)
- Foundation approach complexity: existing 2021 geotech report is the sole basis (Appendix D); no additional investigation budgeted
- Addendum 03 requirements embedded: bay sumps, slab design, solar-capable roof structural considerations

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No warnings.** All line items are priced with RATE_TABLE method and full provenance.
- **No blockers** to estimating were identified. Production readiness dependencies (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, Appendix D) are noted but do not affect pricing.
