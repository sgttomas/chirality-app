## Dependency Analysis

None of the 15 dependencies represent a blocker to producing a meaningful cost estimate for DEL-08-01. The reasoning:

1. **Anchors (A001, A002):** These confirm that DEL-08-01 implements SOW-0023 and supports OBJ-002. They are traceability anchors, not pricing prerequisites.

2. **Interfaces (E001-E006, E010-E011):** These are coordination interfaces with sibling deliverables (DEL-08-02, DEL-08-03, DEL-07-01, DEL-07-02, DEL-07-05, DEL-09-01, DEL-10-02, DEL-06-02). They affect content coordination but do not change the labor hours or rates needed to produce the narrative.

3. **Prerequisites (E007-E009):** These indicate that conceptual design deliverables (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-04, DEL-02-05) should be sufficiently advanced to identify systems requiring commissioning. For estimating purposes, the labor hours to write the narrative are not dependent on the specific systems list -- the Level_of_Effort.csv already accounts for a typical commissioning narrative scope.

4. **Document prerequisite (E012):** RFP Sections 7.3.6 and 7.5 are the requirements source. These are available and have been read.
