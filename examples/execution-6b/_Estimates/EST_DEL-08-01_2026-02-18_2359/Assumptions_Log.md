# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-08-01_2026-02-18_2359

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| EST-A-001 | Commissioning Lead hours (10 hrs) are sufficient to produce the commissioning, training, and closeout narrative for DEL-08-01 | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-08-01/R-21 (Basis=PARAMETRIC) | If scope is more complex than anticipated (e.g., more building systems to address, more detailed training plan required), hours could increase by 25-50% ($350-$700 impact) |
| EST-A-002 | Project Manager hours (4 hrs) are sufficient for review and closeout process input | Level_of_Effort.csv row DEL-08-01/R-02 (Basis=PARAMETRIC) | If PM involvement is heavier (e.g., more coordination cycles with DEL-08-02/DEL-08-03), hours could increase by 50-100% ($175-$350 impact) |
| EST-A-003 | Hourly rates from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv reflect current market rates for Alberta | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (Basis=MARKET, Confidence=MEDIUM) | Rate variance of +/-15% would shift total by +/-$315 |
| EST-A-004 | No additional roles are needed beyond Commissioning Lead and Project Manager for this narrative deliverable | Level_of_Effort.csv (only 2 rows for DEL-08-01) | If technical reviewers (e.g., mechanical/electrical engineers) are needed for QC review of commissioning narrative, add 2-4 hrs at $155-160/hr ($310-$640 impact) |
| EST-A-005 | The narrative is a proposal-stage document (not a construction-phase commissioning plan) and therefore requires proposal-level effort only | Decomposition v2.3 FINAL: DEL-08-01 Type = Commissioning / Narrative; covers SOW-0023 | If the Owner expects construction-level commissioning plan detail at proposal stage, effort could be significantly higher |
