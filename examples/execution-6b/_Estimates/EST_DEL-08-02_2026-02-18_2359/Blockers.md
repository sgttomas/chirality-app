## Dependency Detail (Upstream -- Relevant to Estimating)

### DEP-08-02-003: DEL-08-01 (Commissioning Training Closeout Narrative)
- **Type**: PREREQUISITE (RECOMMENDED)
- **Impact on estimate**: NONE. This is a production sequencing dependency. The deficiency process follows commissioning completion. Hours for DEL-08-02 are independently estimated regardless of DEL-08-01 status.
- **Status**: Not a pricing blocker.

### DEP-08-02-004: DEL-08-03 (Warranty Requirements Narrative)
- **Type**: INTERFACE (RECOMMENDED)
- **Impact on estimate**: NONE. Cross-reference needed for SC54-SC55 consistency, but does not affect the hours or cost to produce the deficiency narrative.
- **Status**: Not a pricing blocker.

### DEP-08-02-005: DEL-09-01 (Detailed Project Schedule)
- **Type**: INTERFACE (RECOMMENDED)
- **Impact on estimate**: NONE. Deficiency timeline must align with project milestones, but this is a content alignment concern, not a pricing driver.
- **Status**: Not a pricing blocker.

### DEP-08-02-009: Cost estimation guidelines (External)
- **Type**: PREREQUISITE (REQUIRED per Procedure)
- **Impact on estimate**: NONE for estimating the deliverable production cost. This dependency is about the content of the narrative (explaining monetary valuation methodology), not about the cost of producing the narrative itself.
- **Status**: Not a pricing blocker.

## Conclusion

No pricing blockers exist for DEL-08-02. All dependencies are production sequencing or content alignment concerns that do not affect the hours or rates used to estimate the cost of producing this deliverable.
