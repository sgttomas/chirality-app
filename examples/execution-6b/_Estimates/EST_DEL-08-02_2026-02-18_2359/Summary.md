## Cost Drivers

The estimate for DEL-08-02 is driven by:
1. **Commissioning Lead hours (75% of cost)**: The Commissioning Lead (R-21) authors the deficiency management narrative covering punch list processes, formal deficiency review, monetary valuation methodology, holdback calculations, 12-month warranty review, and Owner 6-week post-occupancy deficiency addition right.
2. **Project Manager hours (25% of cost)**: The PM (R-02) provides input on the deficiency process framework, reviews for alignment with overall project delivery approach, and ensures consistency with DEL-08-01 (Commissioning) and DEL-08-03 (Warranty).

## Scope Boundaries

- **In scope**: Deficiency management process narrative per RFP Section 7.3.7 (SOW-0024); trade punch lists, formal deficiency review, monetary valuation, substantial performance calculation, Owner 2.5x holdback right, 12-month warranty review, single consolidated deficiency list, Owner 6-week post-occupancy deficiency addition right, resolution timeline.
- **Not in scope (DEL-08-01)**: Commissioning approach, training, O&M manuals, as-built drawings, handover process.
- **Not in scope (DEL-08-03)**: Warranty provisions narrative, SC54-SC55 detailed warranty terms, manufacturer warranty assignment.

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No pricing warnings.** All line items have complete hours and rate evidence.
- **Dependency note**: DEL-08-02 depends on DEL-08-01 (Commissioning) being drafted or in progress (DEP-08-02-003, RECOMMENDED prerequisite). This is a production sequencing concern, not a pricing blocker.
- **Dependency note**: DEL-08-02 has an interface dependency with DEL-08-03 (Warranty) for SC54-SC55 consistency (DEP-08-02-004). This is a content alignment concern, not a pricing blocker.
