# Assumptions Log

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Justification | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| EST-A-01 | DEL-05-04 requires only Senior Electrical Engineer (R-13) effort; no intermediate electrical or other support roles are needed | Level_of_Effort.csv provides exactly one role row for DEL-05-04 (R-13, 8 hrs); no other roles listed | If additional roles are needed (e.g., R-14 intermediate support, or R-02 PM review), total cost would increase. 4 hrs of R-14 at $125/hr would add ~$500. |
| EST-A-02 | 8 hours is sufficient for a complete electrical maintainability narrative covering all six topic areas (panel accessibility, fixture replacement, control systems, IT/telecom, security/access control, fire alarm) | Level_of_Effort.csv Basis=PARAMETRIC; consistent with other PKG-005 deliverables (DEL-05-01=10 hrs, DEL-05-02=8 hrs, DEL-05-03=8 hrs) | If scope is more complex than estimated (e.g., detailed lifecycle costing required), hours could increase by 50-100%. |
| EST-A-03 | $155/hr is an appropriate market rate for Senior Electrical Engineer in the Alberta market for a design-build proposal context | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; Basis=MARKET; Confidence=MEDIUM | Actual negotiated rates may be $140-$175/hr depending on firm and market conditions. |
| EST-A-04 | No travel, printing, software, or disbursement costs are attributable to this deliverable | Not addressed in any price source | If the engineer requires site visits or specialized software for lifecycle analysis, additional costs would apply. |
