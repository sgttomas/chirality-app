## Key Observations

- DEL-05-04 is a single-role narrative deliverable assigned to the Senior Electrical Engineer (R-13).
- 8 hours of effort covers: panel accessibility, lighting fixture replacement strategy, control system serviceability, IT/telecom infrastructure maintainability, security/access control system lifecycle, and fire alarm maintenance approach.
- This is the smallest of the four PKG-005 durability deliverables, consistent with the focused electrical scope.

## Warnings and Blockers

- No pricing warnings. All line items priced from basis evidence.
- 3 upstream prerequisites identified in dependency register (DEL-02-05, DEL-04-03, DEL-05-03) -- all have SatisfactionStatus=TBD. These are execution sequencing dependencies, not pricing blockers.
- 2 upstream interfaces (DEL-03-05, DEL-05-01) -- contextual inputs, not pricing blockers.
- 1 downstream handover to PKG-001 pricing -- DEL-05-04 outputs must inform Schedule B cost capture.
