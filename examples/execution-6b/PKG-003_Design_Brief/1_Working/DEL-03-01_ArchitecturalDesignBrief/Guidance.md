# Guidance — DEL-03-01: Architectural Design Brief

---

## Purpose

The Architectural Design Brief serves **three critical functions** in the RFP response:

1. **Persuasive Communication:** It demonstrates clear, disciplined thinking about the architectural design approach and how it addresses the Owner's requirements (OSR, Appendix A), building code constraints, and operational needs for a 24/7 public safety facility — a combined Fire Hall and Public Works Operations building.

2. **Design Rationale Documentation:** It explains *why* specific architectural decisions were made — site organization, interior layout, finishes strategy, building form — in a way that connects the Conceptual Design (DEL-02-01) to the Functional Program (Appendix B) and the Owner's strategic goals.

3. **Evaluation Scoring Support:** It directly contributes to **OBJ-004 (Deliver a strong Design Brief — 5 evaluation points)**, which requires a multi-discipline brief covering all five disciplines (Arch, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT) with operations-fit rationale. The architectural sub-brief is the lead document in PKG-003 and sets the spatial framework the other briefs respond to.

   **Scoring calibration guidance:** The brief author should consider that evaluators scoring under OBJ-004 are likely assessing: (a) demonstrated understanding of the Owner's operational needs, (b) site-specific design rationale (not generic template responses), (c) integration of Addendum 03 requirements showing responsiveness, (d) clarity of how architectural decisions support the functional program, and (e) coherence across discipline briefs. The brief should be calibrated to demonstrate depth in these areas rather than superficial coverage of all topics equally. **TBD: obtain specific OBJ-004 evaluation rubric criteria from RFP evaluation section if available; otherwise, this guidance represents ASSUMPTION-level interpretation of scoring priorities based on RFP structure.** [Enriched per F-003: SourcePath: Guidance.md > Purpose > Evaluation Scoring Support; RFP evaluation criteria]

### Downstream Use

- **Evaluators** will read this brief to assess the architect's understanding of the site, the Functional Program, and the design's operational fit.
- **Design team members** (structural, civil, mechanical, electrical) will reference this brief to understand architectural constraints and adjacency relationships that bound their own designs.
- **Post-award detail design** will build upon this brief's site organization, finishes philosophy, and code compliance approach as the starting framework.
- **Owners and project committee** (Pendergast, Kowalchuk, Binnendyk) will use this brief to confirm alignment with their operational expectations before accepting the design.

## Principles

### P-001: Start with the Site — Specifically This Site

The design approach must demonstrate **understanding of constraints and opportunities on the specific 12-acre developable site:**
- 8 acres non-buildable (storm pond + dog park on flood fringe) — limits footprint options
- Existing topography and geotechnical conditions per the 2021 geotechnical investigation (Appendix D); DEC-013 confirms no additional geotechnical investigation
- Wetland constraints identified in Wetland Assessment (Appendix D)
- Access from Waskasoo Avenue North
- Snow storage requirements for Alberta climate
- Vehicle turning radii for fire apparatus, PW equipment, and service vehicles

**Why it matters:** The Owner expects a site-specific design, not a generic fire hall template. Evaluators will notice if the brief ignores site-specific challenges. The 12-acre limitation (clarified by Addendum 03 §1.2) must drive building footprint and expansion planning.

### P-002: Functional Program Is Operations, Not Just Space

Interior layout and finishes are not aesthetic choices — they support **24/7 safety-critical operations:**
- Fire apparatus emergency egress: apparatus bays must connect directly to bay doors and apron without obstructions
- Contamination control: dirty-to-clean zone separation in fire hall (gear, decon, SCBA, rest areas)
- PW vehicle operations: clearances for large equipment, access to fuel/fill stations per Addendum 03
- Administrative support that does not conflict with emergency response workflow
- On-call firefighter rest facilities with apparatus bay oversight visibility
- Co-location of Fire Hall and Public Works without operational interference

**Why it matters:** This is a working public safety facility, not an office building. Evaluators who understand fire hall and public works operations will recognize whether the brief reflects operational literacy.

### P-003: Building Code Compliance Is Non-Negotiable — Explain the Approach

The brief must address key compliance areas proactively:
- Building classification and fire compartmentalization (apparatus bays, sleeping quarters, maintenance areas, administrative)
- Egress from on-call sleeping areas (separate path, fire-rated construction per ABC)
- Accessibility throughout (detailed strategy per DEL-03-06; brief notes key features)
- Ventilation compliance — especially fire apparatus direct exhaust ventilation (2 apparatus per bay per Addendum 03; system design per DEL-03-04)
- Construction type per ABC

**Why it matters:** If evaluators sense code risk or see gaps in compliance strategy, confidence in the entire design approach drops. Explicit, specific compliance statements reduce evaluator concern.

### P-004: Addendum 03 Is Your Design Authority — Integrate It, Don't Appendix It

The brief must **integrate** all Addendum 03 clarifications into the relevant narrative sections. Do not create a separate "Addendum 03 Compliance" appendix — weave each requirement into the relevant scope topic:
- 16 ft overhead doors → Architectural Plan Rationale section (door heights shown in DEL-02-01 sections)
- Bay sumps → Architectural Plan Rationale and Functional Adjacency (floor drainage workflow)
- Bunker gear lockers (40) with room-level ventilation → Program Compliance section (room size + ventilation approach noted; detailed HVAC per DEL-03-04)
- Solar-capable roof orientation → Exterior Elevation Design Intent section (orientation stated; electrical provisions per DEL-03-05)
- Room sizing ranges → Program Compliance section (verified against Addendum 03 ranges)
- Second storey for shared spaces → Architectural Plan Rationale (decision noted and justified)

**Why it matters:** Addendum 03 represents the Owner's explicit post-bid clarifications of their intent. Integration demonstrates responsiveness and reduces compliance risk.

### P-005: Exterior Design Must Cite the OSR

The brief must explain exterior elevation design intent **per OSR (Appendix A)** specifically:
- Building form and massing relative to the Owner's vision stated in OSR
- Material durability for Alberta climate (freeze-thaw cycles, wind-driven precipitation, UV exposure)
- Security and public-facing image (fire hall as civic identifier; PW as functional service building)
- Solar-capable roof orientation (per Addendum 03: flat, south, west, or southwest)
- Relationship to adjacent residential development (if noted in OSR)

**Why it matters:** The OSR (Appendix A) contains specific architectural expectations. The brief must demonstrate you've read and responded to it. If OSR details are not accessible, note what architectural design intent aligns with and mark specific OSR clause references as **location TBD**.

**Escalation path when OSR clauses cannot be accessed:** If the author cannot access the OSR Appendix A text directly, the following escalation protocol should be followed rather than relying solely on ASSUMPTION-level interpretations: (1) Request the OSR text from the Owner's representative or proposal coordinator; (2) If unavailable before drafting deadline, document the specific OSR clauses that could not be verified as a formal proposal risk item in the risk register; (3) State the assumed design intent and flag for Owner confirmation during post-award design development. Persistent "location TBD" placeholders for OSR clauses in the final proposal represent an unresolved substantiation gap that may weaken evaluator confidence.

### P-006: Durability Philosophy — Note It, Cross-Reference DEL-05-01

The brief should weave in design choices that support the **50-year main building / 20-year Cold Storage lifespan** while acknowledging that detailed durability rationale lives in DEL-05-01 (Architectural Durability and Maintenance). Minimum content per space type:
- Apparatus bays: sealed concrete with epoxy or polyurea coating, chemical/water/de-icing salt resistance
- PW bays / workshop: commercial-grade tile or coated concrete, impact-resistant wall protection at truck heights
- Administrative / offices: commercial carpet or LVT, cleanable surfaces
- On-call quarters: residential-grade with easy-clean finishes
- High-touch surfaces (railings, locker frames): stainless steel or powder-coated metal

**Why it matters:** OBJ-005 (Durability — 15 evaluation points) is heavily weighted. Even in the architectural brief, demonstrating durability-conscious choices adds credibility to the durability narrative in DEL-05-01.

## Considerations

### C-001: Information Sources and Gaps

**What is available:**
- Functional Program (embedded in RFP Appendix B and Addendum 03)
- Site plans and reference reports: Geotechnical Investigation Report (2021, Appendix D), Wetland Assessment (Appendix D), Site Grading Plan (Appendix E), Site Plan/Subdivision Plan (Appendix F), Flood zone mapping
- OSR / Appendix A (specific Owner requirements; **location TBD** for specific clause references in current working files)
- Addenda 01–03 (all clarifications; integrated in Decomposition §4)
- Proposed Conceptual Design (DEL-02-01) with site plan, floor plans, elevations, sections

**What may not be available (TBD):**
- Detailed Owner meeting notes or project committee preferences beyond RFP record (location TBD)
- Specific aesthetic preferences for exterior materials beyond OSR (to be inferred from OSR and comparable Alberta municipal facilities)
- Detailed utility capacity at site boundary (confirmed after award per Addendum 03 §1.7 — cash allowance approach)
- Specific architectural clause requirements in OSR that require direct reading of Appendix A

**Guidance:** Use conservative assumptions for site-specific values and mark as **ASSUMPTION** where inferred. Do not invent OSR requirements — if specific OSR text cannot be accessed, state "per OSR Appendix A [location TBD]" and provide ASSUMPTION-level interpretation.

### C-002: Scope Boundary Discipline with Sibling Deliverables

The five discipline briefs (DEL-03-01 through DEL-03-05) plus DEL-03-06 are **cross-dependent but scope-separated:**

| Topic | Owner Deliverable | DEL-03-01 Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Site plan / site organization | DEL-03-01 | Own fully |
| Architectural floor plan + finishes | DEL-03-01 | Own fully |
| Exterior elevation design intent | DEL-03-01 | Own fully (per OSR) |
| Parking and site servicing | DEL-03-02 | Cross-reference only |
| Structural system selection | DEL-03-03 | Cross-reference only |
| HVAC / exhaust ventilation system design | DEL-03-04 | Note performance intent; cross-reference DEL-03-04 |
| Backup generator design | DEL-03-04 / DEL-03-05 | Note location/space allocation; cross-reference MEP briefs |
| Electrical / solar provisions | DEL-03-05 | Note roof orientation; cross-reference DEL-03-05 |
| Accessibility (detailed) | DEL-03-06 | Brief note + cross-reference DEL-03-06 |
| Adaptability / expansion (detailed) | DEL-03-06 | Brief note + cross-reference DEL-03-06 |
| 50-year durability strategy (detailed) | DEL-05-01 | Brief note + cross-reference DEL-05-01 |
| Envelope energy performance strategy | DEL-04-01 (PKG-004) | Note architectural envelope design intent; cross-reference DEL-04-01 for energy performance targets [Enriched per E-002] |

**Principle:** State architectural design decisions once, in this brief. Cross-reference for detail. Do not re-explain other disciplines' systems.

### C-002a: Terminology Normalization — Meeting/Training Room

Documents currently alternate between "meeting room," "ICP meeting room," and "training room" without establishing whether these refer to the same space or distinct spaces. The Addendum 03 backup generator context references "meeting room ICP" (suggesting a combined ICP/meeting room), while the Procedure finishes table references "training room" as part of shared spaces. **Clarification needed:** The author should establish in the brief whether the facility includes (a) one multi-use room serving as meeting room, ICP, and training room, or (b) separate rooms. If one multi-use room, adopt a single consistent term (e.g., "ICP / Meeting Room") across all documents and note the multi-use intent. If separate rooms, list each with its program area. **ASSUMPTION: single multi-use room serving as ICP meeting room and training space, based on typical fire hall programming for facilities of this scale. Confirm with functional program (Appendix B).** [Enriched per B-003: SourcePath: Datasheet.md > Conditions (backup generator); Procedure.md > Step 1 Section 4 finishes table; Guidance.md > P-002]

### C-002b: Envelope Energy Interface with PKG-004

The brief's exterior elevation section (ARCH-F03) discusses material palette and solar orientation, which overlaps with PKG-004 (Sustainability and Energy) scope, particularly DEL-04-01 (Building Envelope and Energy Strategy). The scope boundary table (C-002) should be understood as follows: DEL-03-01 owns **architectural design intent** for the building envelope (material selection, form, massing, aesthetic rationale), while DEL-04-01 owns **energy performance strategy** for the envelope (thermal performance targets, insulation strategy, air barrier specification). The brief should include a cross-reference to DEL-04-01 in the exterior elevation section to avoid evaluator confusion about which deliverable owns envelope energy strategy vs. architectural envelope design intent. [Enriched per E-002: SourcePath: Specification.md > Requirements > ARCH-F03; Guidance.md > C-002 scope boundary table]

### C-003: Balancing Completeness with Conciseness

The brief must cover seven required topics and Addendum 03 integration while remaining readable and proposal-quality:

**Target length:** Approximately 3–6 pages (estimate; RFP does not specify). The evaluation committee reads many proposals; clarity over length.

**Strategy:**
- Prioritize: Site organization (evaluators need confidence in site feasibility), functional adjacency (demonstrates operational literacy), program compliance (shows Addendum 03 responsiveness)
- Use tables for program compliance (space names with actual areas vs. Addendum 03 ranges — visual and verifiable)
- Cross-reference rather than repeat: "Detailed accessibility strategy is provided in DEL-03-06 (Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative); architectural design integrates [2–3 specific features]."
- Use DEL-02-01 drawings as primary evidence; narrative explains what the drawings demonstrate

---

## Trade-Offs

### T-001: Depth vs. Breadth Across Seven Required Topics

**Issue:** Seven required topics span from high-level site strategy to specific interior finishes. Covering all seven deeply may exceed readable length.

**Resolution:**
- **Weight by evaluator concern:** Site organization and functional adjacency deserve the most depth (evaluators assessing design feasibility and operational fit). Building code compliance can be more concise if the approach is standard.
- **Use tables for program compliance:** A table showing Addendum 03 sizing ranges vs. designed areas is more efficient than prose.
- **Lead with concept drawings:** Reference DEL-02-01 at every opportunity; evaluators looking at the drawings will absorb what the text describes.

### T-002: Operational Realism vs. Architectural Vision

**Issue:** A public services building is first a working facility, then a civic building. The brief must prioritize operational logic over architectural aesthetics.

**Resolution:** Lead every design decision with operational rationale, then explain how form supports function. Example: "The exterior material palette of [material] was selected for its durability in Alberta climate conditions and low maintenance requirements, supporting the Owner's 50-year design life; the resulting building form is consistent with [OSR Appendix A direction — location TBD]."

### T-003: Innovation vs. Credibility (Addendum 01 Guidance)

**Issue:** Addendum 01 states that missing functional program dimensions are intentional — "designers to propose innovative solutions; spaces must at minimum meet building code." This creates latitude but also risk.

**Resolution:** Innovation should address **identified Owner pain points** or site constraints, not novelty for its own sake. Credible innovations for this project type:
- Two-storey option for shared spaces reduces building footprint (freeing site area for future expansion)
- Modular apparatus bay layout supporting 1 or 2 apparatus per bay with direct exhaust ventilation
- Centralized administrative hub adjacent to both fire and PW wings minimizing administrative duplication

Avoid proposing unproven systems without clear risk mitigation. Any innovation that departs from Alberta norm should include a brief explanation of precedent or risk management approach.

## Examples

### EX-001: Good Brief Excerpt — Functional Adjacency

*"The floor plan organizes the facility around a central administrative and shared services hub, with fire apparatus bays on the east wing and PW bays on the west. This arrangement provides operational separation that minimizes cross-traffic and contamination between fire and PW operations while allowing shared access to the building's common amenities (kitchen, lounge, meeting room). Fire apparatus bays include direct outdoor access to the apron and bay washing area; sumps are integrated into the bay floor per Addendum 03. On-call rest areas are positioned on the second floor of the fire wing, with a direct stair to the apparatus level, maintaining response-time performance and providing visual oversight of the apparatus floor. This adjacency strategy supports 24/7 safety-critical operations with minimal fatigue impact during extended operational periods."*

**Why it works:** Demonstrates operational workflow understanding; cites Addendum 03 (sumps); explains both fire and PW adjacency logic; specific about rest area location and response-time rationale.

### EX-002: Good Brief Excerpt — Interior Finishes by Zone

*"Interior finishes are selected for durability and maintainability specific to each zone's operational demands: Apparatus bays receive sealed concrete with polyurea coating (chemical resistance, de-icing salt tolerance, easy wash-down); PW workshop bays receive coated concrete with rubber wheel-stop curbing at wall base (impact protection from equipment); administrative areas receive commercial-grade LVT flooring with cleanable wainscot (durability without specialized maintenance); on-call quarters receive residential-grade finishes consistent with 24-hour habitation comfort; all high-touch surfaces (locker frames, handrails, door hardware) are stainless steel or powder-coated to resist corrosion. Detailed durability strategy by system is provided in DEL-05-01 (Architectural Durability and Maintenance)."*

**Why it works:** Space-type-specific finishes with operational rationale; connects to 50-year durability goal; cross-references DEL-05-01 appropriately without duplication.

### EX-003: Weak Brief Excerpt — Avoid

*"The building has a modern aesthetic with clean lines and efficient spaces. We believe the design is innovative and cost-effective, meeting all applicable building codes and Owner requirements."*

**Why it fails:** Generic language with no site-specific content, no operational understanding, no Addendum 03 integration, no code specifics. Evaluators will score this poorly. Every sentence should be traceable to a specific RFP requirement, OSR provision, or Addendum 03 item.
