## Steps

### Step 1: Draft the Architectural Design Brief (Estimated: 4–6 hours)

**Action:**

1. Open the brief document with seven sections corresponding to RFP Section 7.1.2(1) topics:

   | Section | RFP Topic |
   |---|---|
   | 1. Site Plan Rationale | Buildable area strategy, vehicle circulation, building placement, site servicing, storm pond |
   | 2. Architectural Plan Rationale | Floor plan organization, storey decision, zone separation, Addendum 03 architectural items |
   | 3. Exterior Elevation Design Intent per OSR | Material palette, building form, OSR compliance, solar roof orientation |
   | 4. Interior Finishes Approach | Zone-by-zone finishes: apparatus bays, PW bays, admin, on-call quarters, shared spaces |
   | 5. Functional Adjacency Rationale | Key spatial relationships tied to operational workflow |
   | 6. Program Compliance Narrative | Space schedule vs. Addendum 03 sizing ranges; Addendum 01 interpretation |
   | 7. Building Code Compliance Approach | ABC fire ratings, egress, accessibility reference, ventilation compliance |

2. For each section, address:
   - What architectural decision supports this aspect?
   - Which OSR (Appendix A) requirements does it respond to?
   - Which Addendum 03 items does it integrate?
   - How does it connect to DEL-02-01 drawings? (Cite specific drawing sheets where possible)
   - What do the sibling discipline briefs own that should be cross-referenced rather than duplicated?

3. **Drafting guidance per section:**

   **Section 1 — Site Plan Rationale:**
   - Explain building footprint placement within the 12-acre developable area; address storm pond/flood fringe (8 acres) as a non-buildable constraint
   - Describe vehicle access approach from Waskasoo Avenue North; apparatus apron and turning radii for fire and PW equipment
   - Identify Cold Storage Building (60' × 100') placement and relationship to main PSB
   - Note Snow storage provisions; identify site area preserved for future expansion (cross-reference DEL-03-06 for detailed adaptability narrative)
   - Reference DEL-02-01 site plan drawing throughout

   **Section 2 — Architectural Plan Rationale:**
   - Describe zone organization: fire apparatus wing, PW wing, administrative/shared hub
   - Justify single-storey vs. second-storey decision for shared spaces per Addendum 03 permission; if two-storey, identify which spaces
   - Describe how 16 ft overhead doors are accommodated (bay height, structural header, door type — structural detail per DEL-03-03)
   - Identify sump locations in bay floors per Addendum 03 (drainage strategy per DEL-03-02)
   - Identify bunker gear room with 40 lockers and room-level ventilation location (ventilation system per DEL-03-04)
   - Identify generator location/space allocation (generator and transfer switch design per DEL-03-04/DEL-03-05)
   - Reference DEL-02-01 floor plans throughout

   **Section 3 — Exterior Elevation Design Intent per OSR:**
   - State OSR (Appendix A) design intent requirements and how the concept responds; cite OSR [location TBD if clause not directly accessible]
   - Describe material palette selection rationale: primary cladding, base material, glazing strategy; justify for Alberta freeze-thaw cycles and 50-year design life (note: detailed durability rationale per DEL-05-01)
   - State roof orientation for solar readiness: [flat/south/west/southwest per Addendum 03]; solar PV electrical provisions per DEL-03-05
   - Describe fire hall public-facing design intent (civic identity, emergency access signage, apparatus bay doors visible from street — or not, per site layout)
   - Reference DEL-02-01 elevation drawings throughout

   **Section 4 — Interior Finishes Approach:**
   - Provide zone-by-zone finishes table or narrative:

     | Zone | Finish Type | Rationale |
     |---|---|---|
     | Apparatus bays | Sealed concrete with epoxy/polyurea coating | Chemical resistance, de-icing salt tolerance, wash-down |
     | PW workshop bays | Coated concrete; impact-resistant wall protection at vehicle height | Equipment impact, oil/chemical resistance |
     | Administrative areas | Commercial LVT or carpet tile; cleanable wainscot | Durability, cleanability, staff comfort |
     | On-call quarters | Residential-grade finishes | 24-hour habitation; comfort and durability |
     | Shared spaces (kitchen, lounge, training room) | Commercial-grade, cleanable | High-traffic, multi-occupancy use |
     | Decon / SCBA / washrooms | Ceramic tile, sealed grout, stainless fixtures | Moisture resistance, bio-contamination washdown |
     | High-touch surfaces (railings, lockers, hardware) | Stainless steel or powder-coated metal | Corrosion resistance, longevity |

   - Cross-reference DEL-05-01 (Architectural Durability and Maintenance) for detailed 50-year / 20-year durability rationale

   **Section 5 — Functional Adjacency Rationale:**
   - Explain key spatial relationships and workflow logic:
     - Apparatus bays → apparatus apron → outdoor washing area (with sumps per Addendum 03)
     - Apparatus bays → bunker gear room (40 lockers with ventilation) → decon → SCBA storage → duty gear storage: clean-to-dirty workflow
     - Fire wing → administrative hub → PW wing: shared access without operational interference
     - On-call rest areas → apparatus level stair: response-time performance
     - PW bays → fill stations (2" per Addendum 03) → fuel: service operations workflow
     - ICP / meeting room → administrative core: emergency coordination access
   - Note which adjacency decisions were constrained by the site (flood fringe, access road location, prevailing wind)
   - Reference DEL-02-01 floor plan for visual support

   **Section 6 — Program Compliance Narrative:**
   - Present space schedule verifying Addendum 03 sizing ranges are met:

     | Space | Addendum 03 Range | Designed Area | Compliant? |
     |---|---|---|---|
     | Apparatus bay (each) | 2,000–2,200 sf | TBD — per DEL-02-01 | TBD |
     | PW workshop bay (each) | 2,000–2,200 sf | TBD — per DEL-02-01 | TBD |
     | Fire gear storage | 200–350 sf | TBD | TBD |
     | EMS storage | 50–70 sf | TBD | TBD |
     | Duty gear | 350–550 sf | TBD | TBD |
     | Decon room | 150–200 sf | TBD | TBD |
     | Decon shower (×2) | 50–60 sf each | TBD | TBD |
     | SCBA room | 150–200 sf | TBD | TBD |
     | Compressor room | 100–150 sf | TBD | TBD |
     | First aid / PPE | 100–150 sf | TBD | TBD |

   - Note that Addendum 01 confirms missing Functional Program dimensions are intentional; designs must at minimum comply with building code
   - Note Cold Storage Building (60' × 100') is unheated; space not listed in fire/PW program ranges but is a required facility
   - Note Pickled Sand Storage Building is excluded from this proposal (Addendum 03 §1.2)

   **Section 7 — Building Code Compliance Approach:**
   - State building classification and construction type per ABC/NBCC; note if fire hall apparatus bay qualifies as Group E or similar — **ASSUMPTION: applicable; confirm with AHJ; location TBD**
   - Identify fire-rated compartmentalization strategy: apparatus bay / on-call quarters / admin separation
   - Identify egress strategy: on-call sleeping areas require separate egress per ABC (fire-rated stair; location TBD in DEL-02-01 drawings)
   - Note accessibility: "Full accessibility to all public and employee areas in accordance with Alberta Building Code; barrier-free path of travel from parking to all accessible spaces; accessible washrooms provided. Detailed accessibility narrative is provided in DEL-03-06 (Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative)."
   - Note ventilation compliance: apparatus bay direct exhaust ventilation per Addendum 03 meets ABC ventilation requirements (detailed system design per DEL-03-04)
   - Note any anticipated variances and proposed approach (TBD — confirm with AHJ in design development)

4. **Integrate Addendum 03 throughout:** Each special requirement should appear in the relevant section, not as a separate checklist. Cite Addendum 03 by name where integration is explicit.

5. **Target length:** 3–6 pages. Use tables for program compliance section to maximize information density.

6. Save draft for internal review.

---

### Step 2: Internal Technical Review (Estimated: 2–3 hours)

**Action:**

1. Assign reviewer: Design-Build PM, Principal Architect, or QA coordinator (not the author).

2. Reviewer checklist:

   - [ ] **Scope coverage:** All seven RFP Section 7.1.2(1) topics addressed?
   - [ ] **Addendum 03 integration:** All architectural-scope special requirements explicitly addressed in relevant sections?
   - [ ] **DEL-02-01 alignment:** Narrative supported by and consistent with Conceptual Design drawings? No statements contradicted by drawings?
   - [ ] **Operational literacy:** Brief demonstrates understanding of 24/7 fire hall and PW operations?
   - [ ] **OSR compliance:** Key OSR (Appendix A) requirements addressed? Citations present (even if clause location is TBD)?
   - [ ] **Code compliance:** ABC/NBCC compliance approach credible, specific, and complete?
   - [ ] **Scope boundaries respected:** No duplication of Civil (DEL-03-02), Structural (DEL-03-03), Mechanical (DEL-03-04), Electrical (DEL-03-05) scope?
   - [ ] **DEL-03-06 cross-references present:** Accessibility and adaptability noted + cross-referenced to DEL-03-06?
   - [ ] **DEL-05-01 cross-references present:** Interior finishes and design choices note durability intent + cross-reference DEL-05-01?
   - [ ] **Durability noted:** At least one durability-conscious finish stated per major space type?
   - [ ] **Program compliance table:** Addendum 03 sizing ranges compared to designed areas (TBD if DEL-02-01 not finalized; clearly flagged)?
   - [ ] **Terminology consistency:** "apparatus bay," "decon room," "ICP," "on-call," "bunker gear" consistent with decomposition vocabulary map and other discipline briefs?
   - [ ] **Proposal-quality writing:** Spelling, grammar, clarity meet professional proposal standards?

3. Reviewer records feedback in tracked changes or review memo.

4. If issues found: return to author for revision (Step 3). If approved: advance to Step 4.

---

### Step 3: Author Revises (Estimated: 1–2 hours, if needed)

**Action:**

1. Author reviews reviewer feedback and updates document to address all issues.

2. Focus areas:
   - Add missing scope items or clarify ambiguous language
   - Strengthen Addendum 03 integration (explicit in-text mentions)
   - Add or correct cross-references to DEL-02-01, DEL-03-06, DEL-05-01, and sibling discipline briefs
   - Correct program compliance table areas if DEL-02-01 dimensions are available
   - Improve operational narrative if feedback indicates insufficient workflow understanding
   - Tighten prose for proposal quality

3. Author notifies reviewer when revision is complete; re-submits for final approval.

---

### Step 4: Final Approval (Estimated: 30 minutes – 1 hour)

**Action:**

1. Reviewer performs final review; confirms all feedback addressed.

2. Approval decision:
   - [ ] **Approved as-is** → Proceed to Step 5
   - [ ] **Approved with minor edits** → Reviewer makes final copyedit; author confirms; proceed to Step 5
   - [ ] **Not approved** → Return to Step 3

3. **Scoring-relevance checkpoint:** Before recording final approval, reviewer shall confirm that brief content is calibrated to maximize OBJ-004 scoring (5 evaluation points), not just meet minimum compliance. Specifically:
   - [ ] Does the brief demonstrate site-specific design rationale (not generic template responses)?
   - [ ] Does the brief show clear integration of Addendum 03 requirements (responsiveness to Owner clarifications)?
   - [ ] Does the brief convey operational literacy for 24/7 fire and public works operations?
   - [ ] Is the brief persuasive in connecting architectural decisions to the functional program and Owner's goals?
   - [ ] Is the depth of treatment calibrated per Guidance T-001 (weight toward site organization, functional adjacency, and program compliance)?
   If any scoring-relevance items are deficient, return to Step 3 with specific feedback on scoring impact areas. **[Enriched per D-002: SourcePath: Procedure.md > Steps > Step 4: Final Approval; Step 5: Verification]**

4. Approval sign-off: Reviewer or PM records date, name, and version approved.

### Version Control Mechanism

All draft iterations of the Architectural Design Brief (Steps 1 through 4) shall be tracked using one of the following approaches, as determined by the Design-Build PM:

1. **Filename convention:** `DEL-03-01_ArchDesignBrief_v[X.Y]_[YYYY-MM-DD].docx` where X = major version (post-review cycle), Y = minor version (intra-step edits), and the date is the file save date. Example: `DEL-03-01_ArchDesignBrief_v1.0_2024-08-15.docx` (first draft), `DEL-03-01_ArchDesignBrief_v1.1_2024-08-16.docx` (revision after Step 2 review), `DEL-03-01_ArchDesignBrief_v2.0_2024-08-18.docx` (approved final).
2. **Version log table** maintained at the end of the brief document or in a companion file, recording: version number, date, author, reviewer, change summary, and status (Draft / Under Review / Approved).
3. **Version control system** (e.g., SharePoint versioning, Git, or project management tool with document versioning) that automatically tracks all revisions with timestamps and author attribution.

The selected approach shall be confirmed during the Pre-Draft Coordination Meeting (see Prerequisites > Coordination Commitments) and documented in the project QA folder. All intermediate drafts shall be retained for audit trail purposes. **[Enriched per X-003: SourcePath: Procedure.md > Records > Artifacts Produced]**
