## Scope

### What This Deliverable Covers

The Architectural Design Brief is a narrative document that explains and justifies the architectural design approach for the Penhold Public Services Building (RFP 2024_004) proposal. It addresses all key architectural decisions that inform the overall design and support the Proposed Conceptual Design (DEL-02-01).

**Scope per RFP Section 7.1.2(1) — Seven Required Topics:**
1. Site plan rationale
2. Architectural plan rationale
3. Exterior elevation design intent per Owner Statement of Requirements (OSR, Appendix A)
4. Interior finishes approach
5. Functional adjacency rationale
6. Program compliance narrative
7. Building code compliance approach

**Scope per Decomposition SOW-0011:**
- One of five discipline sub-briefs (Architectural, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT) required under Section 7.1.2
- Architect authors this sub-brief; Lead Architect coordinates the PKG-003 package
- Architectural brief sets site organization and floor plan constraints that inform the other discipline sub-briefs

**Scope per Addendum 03 Integration (SOW-0010):**
- Integration of all special requirements relevant to architecture: 16 ft overhead doors, bay sumps, fire apparatus direct exhaust ventilation (2 per bay), PW bay general ventilation, backup generator provisions (ICP/kitchen/2 bathrooms/bay door secondary opening), 2" water fill stations (fire bay and PW bay), solar-capable roof orientation, 40 bunker gear lockers with room-level ventilation, room sizing ranges from Addendum 03, second-storey option for shared spaces

- Mechanical/HVAC design rationale; HVAC sizing; exhaust ventilation system design (covered in DEL-03-04 — Mechanical Design Brief)
- Electrical/IT design rationale; solar electrical provisions (covered in DEL-03-05 — Electrical Design Brief)
- Accessibility narrative (detailed coverage owned by DEL-03-06 — Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative; DEL-03-01 may briefly note the approach and cross-reference DEL-03-06)
- Adaptability and future expansion narrative (owned by DEL-03-06 — Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative; DEL-03-01 may briefly note expansion design provisions and cross-reference DEL-03-06)
- Durability and maintenance strategy for 50-year / 20-year design life (owned by DEL-05-01 — Architectural Durability and Maintenance; DEL-03-01 may note design choices that support durability and cross-reference DEL-05-01)
- Detailed construction drawings or specifications (future delivery phases)
