# Structural Design Brief -- Specification

## Scope

### Inclusions

This deliverable covers the structural sub-brief for the Town of Penhold Public Services Building (RFP 2024_004), authored by the Structural Engineer as part of PKG-003. It addresses:

- Structural system selection rationale for the Main Building (Fire Hall + Public Works combined) and Cold Storage Building (60' x 100'), emphasizing cost-effectiveness and operational flexibility
- Foundation design approach grounded in the 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (USG1123, Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., 12 February 2021) -- the sole authorized geotechnical basis (DEC-013)
- Load path narrative for gravity, snow, wind, lateral (seismic), and heavy operational loads appropriate for Penhold, Alberta
- Structural provisions for future building expansion per RFP Section 7.1.5 and OSR §10.3.5
- Slab-on-grade design rationale for apparatus bays and workshop bays including sump penetration detailing approach
- Cold Storage Building floor system selection rationale (slab-on-grade, gravel, or other per OSR §10.3.8 options), including basis for selected floor treatment in context of unheated condition and frost-active subgrade
- Structural implications of Addendum 03 requirements (16 ft minimum overhead doors; bay sumps; solar-capable roof structure)
- Grade-supported slab preparation requirements including radon sump provision (per USG1123 §7.1)

### Exclusions

- Detailed structural calculations and engineering drawings (produced at detailed design phase, not at proposal stage)
- Architectural durability narrative (DEL-05-01, PKG-005)
- Structural durability and corrosion protection narrative (DEL-05-02, PKG-005)
- Cross-cutting adaptability narrative beyond structural provisions (DEL-03-06 covers broader accessibility and adaptability)
- Pickled Sand Storage building (excluded per Addendum 03 §1.2 / C-10)
- Geotechnical investigation scope (Design-Builder to retain qualified geotechnical services per OSR §10.3.6; USG1123 used as background only)
