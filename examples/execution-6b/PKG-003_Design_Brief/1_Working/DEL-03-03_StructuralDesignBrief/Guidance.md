# Structural Design Brief -- Guidance

## Purpose

The Structural Design Brief exists to demonstrate to the RFP evaluation committee that the design team has applied sound structural engineering judgment to system selection, understood the site's geotechnical constraints, planned a cost-effective and flexible structural approach, and provided credible provisions for future building expansion. This brief is evaluated under OBJ-004 (Design Brief, 5 pts) and contributes supporting evidence to OBJ-005 (Durability, 15 pts) when structural longevity provisions are addressed.

This document is a **proposal-stage communication tool**, not an engineering calculation package. Its value is in the clarity and credibility of rationale, not in numerical precision. The audience includes municipal stakeholders with varying levels of structural knowledge -- plain language is essential.

**Audience calibration:** The brief is scored by an evaluation committee that may include municipal administrators, facilities managers, and elected officials alongside technical reviewers. The Structural Engineer should self-assess whether the brief's rationale is persuasive to a non-structural audience. Practical strategies include: (a) leading each section with a plain-language summary sentence before introducing technical parameters; (b) explaining "why this matters" for key decisions (e.g., why deep foundations are preferred over shallow -- linking to long-term settlement risk and lifecycle cost, not just geotechnical nomenclature); (c) avoiding unexplained jargon (e.g., define "adfreezing" on first use); (d) using the geotechnical findings to tell a compelling site-specific story rather than listing parameters in isolation. The brief should be technically complete but written as if the audience's first question will be "so what does this mean for our building?" ASSUMPTION: audience calibration guidance is a best-practice recommendation; the exact evaluation panel composition is not confirmed.

**Expected brief length and depth:** For a 5-point evaluation criterion (OBJ-004), the structural sub-brief should be substantial enough to demonstrate competence but concise enough to respect the evaluation committee's time. ASSUMPTION: an approximate scope of 6-10 pages (or 2,000-3,000 words) is a defensible planning target for a proposal-stage structural design brief of this complexity, covering system selection, foundation approach, load path, slab detailing, and expansion provisions. The brief should not be a single page (insufficient depth) nor a 20-page treatise (excessive for proposal stage). Calibrate effort to the weight of the criterion and the number of topic areas (approximately 10-11 sections per Procedure Step 5). Actual length TBD by Lead Architect / Proposal Manager based on overall proposal page budget.

## Principles

**P-001: Explain, do not just state.**
The RFP asks the Proponent to provide a brief "while considering cost, flexibility, and the potential for future expansion" (RFP §7.1.2(3)). This means each system selection must be accompanied by explicit reasoning: why this system over alternatives, and how it delivers on the stated values. A list of systems without rationale does not satisfy the requirement.

**P-002: Ground the foundation approach in the geotechnical report.**
The 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (USG1123) is the sole authorized geotechnical basis (DEC-013: no additional investigation). The brief must reference this report explicitly and demonstrate that the foundation system selection is consistent with USG1123's key findings: clay is frost-active and high-plasticity (CH, weighted average undrained shear strength 90 kPa), not suitable as bearing stratum for shallow foundations; till provides good deep foundation support (Su = 184 kPa); groundwater is approximately 3.0-4.0 m below grade; frost penetration depth is 2.0 m.
Source: USG1123 §4.1.5, §4.2, §5 items 2-3, §5.5.1.

**P-003: Address the Cold Storage Building's unheated condition explicitly.**
The Cold Storage Building (60' x 100') is intentionally unheated (Decomposition v2.3). This has a direct structural consequence: a frost-active, high-plasticity clay subgrade under an unheated structure will experience seasonal frost heave that can damage movement-sensitive shallow foundations. USG1123 §5 item 2 (p.10) explicitly states: "Construction of unheated, on-grade structures and/or shallow foundations, where movement would be detrimental, is not recommended at this site." The structural brief must address this, most likely by recommending a deep foundation (pile or helical anchor) or a thermally equivalent approach even for the Cold Storage Building.

**P-004: Expansion provisions are explicitly scored.**
RFP §7.1.5 asks the Proponent to "demonstrate how the site and building design are adaptable to changing needs and accommodate the potential for future building expansion" and specifically calls out the Structural Design Brief for this (RFP §7.1.5 last sentence). This is not a peripheral topic -- it must be substantive. At minimum, the brief should identify: (a) which faces of the building can be expanded, (b) how the framing system supports future bay additions, (c) how the foundation system was designed to allow extension without conflict, and (d) that end walls are designed as removable/penetrable non-load-bearing infill.

**P-005: Cost-effectiveness rationale should be grounded, not generic.**
Statements like "we selected the most cost-effective structural system" are not persuasive without evidence. The brief gains credibility by naming specific cost drivers (e.g., span requirements for apparatus bays, column-free interior requirements, off-the-shelf components, local supply availability, pile type trade-offs) and explaining how the selected system addresses them. OSR §10.3.4 explicitly requires "cost effective, easy to maintain" design.

**P-006: Concrete mix design requirements are non-negotiable site constraints.**
USG1123 §4.3 requires concrete in contact with native soils to be designed for severe sulphate attack (Class S-2, Type HS cement, 32 MPa min at 56 days, w/c max 0.45, per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014). Note: sulphate testing was not performed due to schedule constraints; the specification is applied as a conservative precaution. Calcium chloride admixtures are prohibited. Air entrainment is required for all concrete exposed to freeze-thaw. These are site-specific constraints from a professional report -- stating them clearly signals design rigor to the evaluation committee.

**Rationale for S-2 classification without sulphate test data:** The geotechnical report (USG1123 §4.3) applies the most severe sulphate exposure class (S-2) as a conservative precaution because sulphate concentration testing was not performed as part of the geotechnical investigation. In the absence of site-specific sulphate concentration data, applying S-2 is the defensible professional position: it ensures that concrete in contact with native soils will resist sulphate attack even if actual concentrations prove to be at the upper end of the range. A reviewer or evaluator may question why S-2 is specified without test data; the brief should make this conservative-precaution rationale explicit, stating that the Structural Engineer has adopted the geotechnical engineer's recommendation as a prudent measure pending any future confirmation testing. This strengthens the brief's credibility by demonstrating awareness of data limitations rather than obscuring them.

**P-007: The geotechnical report has limitations that must be acknowledged.**
USG1123 was prepared for Tagish Engineering Ltd., not for the Design-Builder. The Design-Builder uses it as background information and the limitations section states explicitly that recommendations "do not constitute a design" and that "subsurface conditions may vary between boreholes." The brief should note that the Structural Engineer has reviewed and incorporated the report findings, while acknowledging the limitations and noting that the Design-Builder will retain qualified geotechnical services during construction per OSR §10.3.6.

## Considerations

**C-001: Framing system options and their trade-offs for apparatus bay spans.**
Apparatus bays for fire and public works operations require clear spans to allow unobstructed vehicle access and safe equipment maneuvering. Room size ranges from Addendum 03 §1.21 indicate apparatus bays and workshop bays are each 2,000-2,200 sf. At 16 ft door widths, a bay of that size implies spans in the range of 50-60 ft per bay. Common structural approaches include:
- Pre-engineered metal building (PEMB): lowest initial cost, fast delivery, standard bay widths; somewhat limited in architectural flexibility; durable if coatings maintained; compatible with solar-capable flat/slope roof orientations
- Structural steel with masonry/metal stud infill: higher flexibility, custom spans, long-term durability benefit from masonry wall mass; slightly higher initial cost
- Reinforced concrete masonry: heavy, thermally massive, durable, but higher labour cost and less flexible for future modification
ASSUMPTION: a PEMB or structural steel framing is most likely the cost-effective choice for apparatus bay spans in Alberta municipal facilities of this type. Exact system TBD by Structural Engineer.

**C-002: Foundation system trade-offs at this site.**
Three systems are documented in USG1123 as viable (§5): shallow footings (bearing on sand -- NOT clay), driven steel pipe piles, and screw piles. Cast-in-place piles would likely require casing/pumping due to seepage (USG1123 §5 intro). Mixing systems on one structure is explicitly discouraged.

Key trade-offs between driven pipe piles and screw piles:
- Driven pipe piles: higher unit capacity (end bearing till = 1,656 kPa per Table 5.1); require hammer mobilization; potential for pre-boring if difficult driving; PDA testing can increase resistance factor to phi = 0.5 (compression)
- Screw piles (helical): described as "ideal" for this site (USG1123 §5.3, p.18); faster installation with rotary attachment; removable (future flexibility); smaller adfreezing stresses compared to driven piles; helices must be fully below 2.0 m frost depth
- Both require minimum embedment of 5.3 m for unheated structures (to resist frost jacking per USG1123 §5.5.2)

For Cold Storage Building (unheated, 20-year design life), if post-and-frame (pole shed): treat timber posts bearing on grade require assessment for frost heave in the frost-active zone -- helical micro-anchors for posts may be appropriate.
Source: USG1123 §5.2, §5.3, §5.5.2, pp.15-24.

**Cold Storage Building floor system options:** The Cold Storage Building floor treatment is a distinct decision from the Main Building slab-on-grade. OSR §10.3.8 provides flooring options for cold storage areas. The brief should explicitly state the selected Cold Storage Building floor system (or present options with rationale). Possible floor treatments include: (a) concrete slab-on-grade (prepared subgrade per USG1123 §7.1, but note frost heave risk in unheated building on CH clay); (b) compacted gravel floor (lower cost, acceptable for equipment storage, avoids slab-on-frost-active-clay issue); (c) other per OSR §10.3.8. The Datasheet lists Cold Storage Building as receiving 16' x 16' doors (OSR §10.3.9; Addendum 03 §1.10) and Procedure Step 2 references "OSR §10.3.8 Option 2" but does not define the options in context. The brief should link the floor system choice to the unheated thermal condition and frost-active subgrade constraint. ASSUMPTION: floor system decision is appropriately made by the Structural Engineer in coordination with the Architect.

**C-003: Slab-on-grade in apparatus bays and workshop bays.**
The geotechnical report (USG1123 §7.1) provides a 13-item recommendation sequence for grade-supported slabs:
1. Strip topsoil/organics to native sand subgrade; 2. Maintain uniform bearing; 3. Compact to 98% SPDD (100% for fills >1.2 m); 4. Fill with non-expansive low-to-medium plastic soil; 5. Install radon sump near centre; 6. Place 150 mm of 20 mm screened rock (radon rock); 7. Install polyethylene sheeting (CAN/CGSB-51.34-M); 8. Design to prevent load transfer from moving slab to stable structural elements; 9. Provide site drainage at min 2% slope; 10. Use separation boards between slab and grade beam; 11. Do NOT tie reinforcing steel between slab and grade beam edge; 12. Use sleeves for all pipes through slab; 13. Review design to eliminate load transfer from grade-supported to structurally supported elements.

Sump penetrations (required in all bays per Addendum 03 §1.8) add a complication: reinforced thickened slab edges around sump openings, waterproofing membrane continuity, and sleeve/telescoping connections to prevent load transfer from slab movement to sump boxes should be addressed.

**C-004: Roof structure for solar loading.**
Addendum 03 §1.17 and OSR §10.3.9 require solar-capable roofing. Roof orientation options are flat, south, west, or southwest. For structural design purposes, the roof structure must either: (a) be designed with reserve dead load capacity for future solar panel installations (ballasted systems typically 15-25 psf; flush-mounted systems 5-10 psf), or (b) include a clear statement that solar dead load will be specified at detailed design and reserve capacity incorporated into the structural drawings. Coordination with DEL-04-02 (Mechanical Energy and Solar Readiness) and DEL-04-03 (Electrical Energy Efficiency) is required to establish the design solar load.
ASSUMPTION: a minimum 15 psf reserve solar dead load provision is a defensible planning value; actual value TBD at detailed design.

**C-005: Structural height requirement and its effect on framing.**
OSR §10.3.9 requires the roof/exterior structural height to provide clearance for graders, tandem dump trucks (dump height up to 22 ft), loaders, and Type 1 fire apparatus. The 16 ft overhead door is a minimum, not a maximum; internal clear height must accommodate dump box raise in the workshop bay. This requirement drives the eave height of the structural frame.
ASSUMPTION: eave height in the range of 24-28 ft is likely required for the main bay volume. Exact eave height TBD at detailed design based on confirmed equipment list and dump box dimensions.

**C-006: Expansion direction and site relationship.**
The 12-acre developable site (Addendum 03 §1.1) provides significant space for future expansion. The structural brief should coordinate with the site concept plan (DEL-02-02) to identify which face(s) allow future bay addition (typically the end wall of the apparatus bay wing or the rear of the workshop wing). The structural end walls should be designed as non-load-bearing infill panels that can be removed for bay extension. The site plan (OSR §10.3.1) shows building placed toward the west side of the developable area, suggesting eastward and/or northward expansion may be possible.
ASSUMPTION: expansion direction to be confirmed in DEL-02-02 (site concept plan); cited here as context only.

**C-007: Seismic design context for Penhold.**
USG1123 §6 (p.25) classifies the site as seismic Site Class C (average shear wave velocity 360 < Vs < 760 m/s; Su > 100 kPa). The brief should acknowledge seismic design per NBCC for Site Class C, but for this location in central Alberta, wind typically governs lateral design over seismic.
ASSUMPTION: seismic is not expected to govern lateral frame design for this location, to be confirmed at detailed design.

**C-008: Building naming terminology normalization.**
Throughout the brief and all supporting documents, use the following standardized building names consistently: **"Main Building"** (not "PSB," "main structure," or "Public Services Building" except when quoting the RFP title) and **"Cold Storage Building"** (not "cold storage," "Cold Storage," or "storage building"). This normalization avoids ambiguity for the evaluation committee and ensures cross-document consistency with other PKG-003 deliverables. Procedure Step 7 item 2 includes a final terminology check; however, the author should apply consistent naming from the outset rather than relying solely on a final-review correction pass.

## Trade-offs

**T-001: Cost-effectiveness vs. long-term flexibility.**
PEMB systems have the lowest initial structural cost for apparatus bay buildings in Alberta but are factory-configurable within limited span/height ranges. Custom structural steel allows greater layout flexibility and future modification, at higher initial cost. For a 50-year design life, the trade-off favours flexibility and durability unless budget is a hard constraint. The RFP explicitly requires consideration of both "cost-effectiveness" and "flexibility" in RFP §7.1.2(3) -- the brief must address both, not just one.
Sources: OSR §10.3.4; RFP §7.1.2(3).

**T-002: Deep vs. shallow foundation: first cost vs. risk.**
Shallow strip footings bearing in compacted sand are theoretically viable at lower cost (USG1123 §5.4: ULS = 300 kPa, SLS = 100 kPa on sand; ULS = 360 kPa, SLS = 120 kPa on till at >2.0 m). However, the high-plasticity clay and frost-active conditions make shallow foundations a higher long-term risk for differential movement. This risk is particularly acute for the unheated Cold Storage Building, where USG1123 §5 item 2 explicitly discourages unheated on-grade structures. Pile foundations have higher initial cost but significantly lower settlement and heave risk over 50 and 20-year design lives, respectively.
Source: USG1123 §5 items 2-3, §5.4, pp.10, 21-23.

**T-003: Standard column grids vs. column-free apparatus bays.**
Standard column grids (e.g., 20-ft bays) reduce structural steel quantities and material cost but require columns that can interfere with apparatus bay operations and reduce operational flexibility. Apparatus bays in fire halls and public works facilities demand column-free clear spans for safe vehicle maneuvering. The structural cost premium for long-span frames is justified by the functional requirement and future operational flexibility.
Source: OSR §10.3.5 (apparatus types listed; maneuvering requirements implied); Addendum 03 §1.21 (bay size ranges 2,000-2,200 sf).

**T-004: Driven pipe piles vs. screw piles.**
Both are viable at this site per USG1123. Driven pipe piles have higher end bearing capacity per pile (1,656 kPa in till) and require fewer piles for heavy loads; screw piles are described as "ideal" for this site, have lower adfreezing stresses, can be removed in future, and can be installed in frozen soil. The trade-off involves: pile count vs. installation complexity; mobilization cost (hammer for driven vs. rotary for screw); and PDA testing benefit (can increase driven pile resistance factor from 0.4 to 0.5). Decision is appropriately made by Structural Engineer at detailed design.

## Examples

**EX-001: Good practice -- foundation system statement with geotechnical grounding.**
A persuasive foundation rationale in this brief would read approximately as:

> "Based on the 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File USG1123), the site subgrade consists of frost-active, high-plasticity clay (MUSC classification CH, weighted average Su = 90 kPa) which is not recommended as a bearing stratum for shallow foundations and will experience significant volume changes with moisture variation. Frost penetration depth is estimated at 2.0 m for the Penhold region. Groundwater is approximately 3.0-4.0 m below grade. Accordingly, the structural design proposes [driven steel pipe piles / helical screw piles] bearing in the underlying till stratum (Su = 184 kPa) for the Main Building. Screw piles with helices fully below the 2.0 m frost depth, or driven piles with minimum embedment of 5.3 m, will be used to resist frost jacking forces. A single pile system will be used throughout; mixing pile types under the same structure is avoided per USG1123 recommendations. A minimum 150 mm void will be provided between pile-supported structures and clay subgrade to accommodate frost heave without structural impact."

This statement: names the system with specific values, cites the geotechnical report constraints, makes the single-system commitment, and addresses frost design. It is verifiable and demonstrates site-specific competence.

**EX-002: Weak practice -- system named without rationale.**
A weak statement would read:

> "The structural system will be a pre-engineered steel building on appropriate foundations."

This fails to explain why, does not demonstrate site-specific foundation understanding, and does not address expansion, loads, frost design, or geotechnical constraints. It will score poorly under OBJ-004.

**EX-003: Good practice -- expansion provisions statement.**
A substantive expansion provision would read:

> "The Main Building structural end walls are designed as non-load-bearing metal stud infill panels that can be removed without affecting the primary frame. End-bay roof trusses/frames are connected to the adjacent bay frames with bolted moment connections designed to receive future bay frames without modification. The [driven/screw] pile foundation grid extends to the current building perimeter; the structural engineer will confirm at detailed design whether end piles are sized with capacity reserve to receive future tributary loads, or whether a future pile row is pre-installed at the expansion bay line. Based on coordination with the site concept plan (DEL-02-02), the preferred expansion direction is [east/north]; no permanent site obstacles have been placed in this zone."
