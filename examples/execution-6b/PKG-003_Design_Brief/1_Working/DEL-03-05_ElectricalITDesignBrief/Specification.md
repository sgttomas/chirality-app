## Notes

- **ASSUMPTION:** Design brief follows narrative format per PKG-003 conventions (seven sub-topic sections as listed in Scope). No standalone drawing package required for proposal submission.
- **Location TBD:** Specific IES publication editions, CEC edition applicable in Alberta, and specific ABC sections require access to current standards.
- **Coordination dependency:** This brief's completion depends on parallel or near-concurrent work on DEL-02-05 (Electrical/IT Concept Narrative) and DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept for generator sizing) so rationale is mutually consistent.
- Access control and security/camera are Additional Option 12.3 and Additional Option 12.4 respectively. Electrical brief must address base electrical infrastructure (which is in base scope) separately from optional equipment/installation. This scope distinction is mandatory.
