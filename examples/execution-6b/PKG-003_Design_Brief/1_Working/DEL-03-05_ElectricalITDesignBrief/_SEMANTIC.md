# Deliverable: DEL-03-05 Electrical/IT Design Brief

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** The Electrical/IT Design Brief exists to articulate and justify the design philosophy for all electrical and information technology systems in a combined emergency services and public works facility -- spanning power distribution, lighting, controls, telecommunications, security infrastructure, fire alarm, and solar-readiness -- so that an evaluation committee can assess the coherence, operational fitness, and regulatory compliance of the proposed electrical/IT approach.

L = {adequate value assurance, validated merit adequacy, proven value adequacy, validated quality sufficiency}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * sufficiency = **adequate worth**

**Step 2:**
- p1 = adequate worth * adequate value assurance = **sufficient value confirmation**
- p2 = adequate worth * validated merit adequacy = **adequate merit proof**
- p3 = adequate worth * proven value adequacy = **substantiated worth evidence**
- p4 = adequate worth * validated quality sufficiency = **confirmed quality adequacy**

**Step 3:** Centroid of {sufficient value confirmation, adequate merit proof, substantiated worth evidence, confirmed quality adequacy} --> u = **"substantiated value adequacy"**

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- "resolved value mandate" * "exhaustive governance purview" = **total value governance**
- "justified merit realization" * "total execution scope" = **comprehensive merit fulfillment**
- "conclusive value verdict" * "exhaustive adjudicative purview" = **total value adjudication**
- "anchored quality assurance" * "exhaustive assurance review" = **comprehensive quality review**

L = {total value governance, comprehensive merit fulfillment, total value adjudication, comprehensive quality review}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * completeness = **total worth**

**Step 2:**
- p1 = total worth * total value governance = **exhaustive value stewardship**
- p2 = total worth * comprehensive merit fulfillment = **complete merit realization**
- p3 = total worth * total value adjudication = **full worth adjudication**
- p4 = total worth * comprehensive quality review = **holistic quality accounting**

**Step 3:** Centroid of {exhaustive value stewardship, complete merit realization, full worth adjudication, holistic quality accounting} --> u = **"exhaustive value fulfillment"**

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- "resolved value mandate" * "harmonized governance discipline" = **unified value discipline**
- "justified merit realization" * "coherent execution discipline" = **coherent merit practice**
- "conclusive value verdict" * "principled adjudicative coherence" = **principled value coherence**
- "anchored quality assurance" * "harmonized oversight alignment" = **aligned quality assurance**

L = {unified value discipline, coherent merit practice, principled value coherence, aligned quality assurance}

**Step 1:** a = evaluative * consistency = **value coherence**

**Step 2:**
- p1 = value coherence * unified value discipline = **integrated value standard**
- p2 = value coherence * coherent merit practice = **harmonized merit method**
- p3 = value coherence * principled value coherence = **principled worth alignment**
- p4 = value coherence * aligned quality assurance = **coherent quality standard**

**Step 3:** Centroid of {integrated value standard, harmonized merit method, principled worth alignment, coherent quality standard} --> u = **"principled value discipline"**
