## Notes

- This deliverable is the **electrical/IT sub-brief** within the larger Design Brief (PKG-003). It stands alone but must coordinate with the other five discipline sub-briefs (Architectural, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Accessibility/Adaptability).
- The RFP explicitly names the sub-topics in §7.1.2(5): power distribution, lighting, controls, communications/IT, and access control. Fire alarm and solar-readiness are added per OSR §10.x requirements and Addendum 03 §1.15/§1.17.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Design brief is produced in Markdown narrative format per PKG-003 conventions; no separate PDF/drawing artifact required for proposal submission.
- Access control (Additional Option 12.3) and security/camera (Additional Option 12.4) are priced separately. The base electrical brief must describe the infrastructure readiness; the optional items describe actual equipment/installation. This distinction must be explicit in the brief.
