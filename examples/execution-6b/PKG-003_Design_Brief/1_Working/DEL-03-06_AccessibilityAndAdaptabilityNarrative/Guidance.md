# Guidance — Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative

## Purpose

DEL-03-06 is a cross-discipline narrative that serves two distinct but complementary evaluation purposes within the RFP §7 Project Delivery Plan:

1. **Accessibility (RFP §7.1.3):** Demonstrates that the Design-Builder understands and will meet Alberta Building Code accessibility requirements. The RFP expects "a narrative describing accommodation of key accessibility elements if/as required by the Alberta Building Code" (RFP p. 17). The evaluator is looking for confirmation that accessibility is designed-in, not added-on.

2. **Adaptability, Flexibility, and Potential for Expansion (RFP §7.1.5):** Demonstrates that the site and building design can accommodate changing needs and future expansion. The RFP calls for the Design-Builder to "demonstrate how the site and building design are adaptable to changing needs and accommodate the potential for future building expansion" — with explicit linkage to the Structural Design Brief (RFP §7.1.5 cross-reference to §7.1.2.3).

This narrative directly supports **OBJ-004 (Design Brief: 5 pts)** and is directionally relevant to **OBJ-005 (Durability and operational flexibility: 15 pts)** per SOW-0014 and SOW-0015.

> **Scoring weight note (C-002):** OBJ-005 carries 15 points versus OBJ-004's 5 points -- a 3:1 scoring weight differential. This suggests that the adaptability, flexibility, and expansion narrative (RFP SS7.1.5) merits proportionally greater development, depth, and emphasis than the accessibility narrative (RFP SS7.1.3). Both must be strong, but the higher-weighted adaptability content should receive the greater share of narrative length, specificity, and supporting evidence. Authors should allocate drafting effort accordingly. *(Enriched per C-002: scoring weight rationale added)*

The narrative is authored by the Architect, with coordinated input from the Structural Engineer (expansion provisions) and Mechanical/Electrical engineers (MEP system flexibility).

## Principles

### P-001: Accessibility as a Design Foundation, Not a Compliance Checkbox

Universal design — the principle of designing for all users regardless of age, ability, or temporary condition — should be positioned as a foundational design intent. The facility will serve firefighting personnel, public works staff, administrative staff, and members of the public visiting the building. All of these users have a range of mobility, vision, and cognitive needs. Accessibility that is integrated from the concept stage produces better outcomes than accessibility retrofitted to meet code minimums.

Source: RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17); best practice in public facility design.

### P-002: Alberta Building Code (ABC) Sets the Compliance Floor

The Alberta Building Code (ABC) governs accessibility requirements for this facility as the AHJ-applicable code. The specific edition and clause numbers are not identified in the RFP and will be confirmed during the detailed design and permitting phase. The narrative should reference the Alberta Building Code by title and note that specific sections will be cited in construction documents. Where the narrative proposes specific features (e.g., minimum door clear width, turning radius), those should be labeled as ASSUMPTION until code review is complete.

Source: RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17); RFP §7.2 (Design-Builder responsible for conformity to all AHJ requirements).

### P-003: Adaptability Is a 50-Year Investment Decision

The facility is intended to serve the community for 50 years (RFP §2.2 background; OBJ-005). The Town of Penhold is a growing municipality (~4,000 residents, described as "fast-growing" in RFP §2.2). Designing today's building to constrain tomorrow's growth is a long-term cost risk. Structural provisions, MEP routing, and flexible interior layout all represent relatively low upfront cost relative to the major renovation cost they prevent.

Source: RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17); RFP §2.2 (p. 7–8); OBJ-005.

### P-004: Site Expansion Is Bounded — Understand the Envelope

The 12-acre developable site (of 20 total acres) is the constrained expansion envelope. Eight acres is on the flood fringe (storm pond + dog park) and is not suitable for building construction (Addendum 03 §1.1). Wetland constraints are documented in the Wetland Assessment (Appendix D). The expansion narrative must propose scenarios that fit within the 12-acre usable area and acknowledge these no-build constraints explicitly. The site plan and civil design (DEL-02-02) should be developed with this in mind from the concept stage.

Source: Addendum 03 §1.1 (p. 1); Wetland Assessment (Appendix D).

### P-005: Structural and This Narrative Must Speak the Same Language

RFP §7.1.5 explicitly cross-references §7.1.2.3 (Structural Design Brief). This means the evaluator will read DEL-03-03 and DEL-03-06 together. Contradictions or gaps between structural expansion provisions and this adaptability narrative will undermine credibility. The Architect must ensure the expansion scenario described here (number of bays, expansion direction, phasing) is exactly consistent with the structural column grid, foundation sizing, and utility routing described in DEL-03-03.

Source: RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17) direct cross-reference.

### P-006: Second Storey Is an Adaptability Tool

Addendum 03 §1.5 confirms that a second storey is acceptable for shared spaces. This means the Design-Builder can propose vertical expansion (second storey) as a future adaptability option, in addition to horizontal footprint expansion. A second storey for administrative, shared, or ICP functions frees ground-floor space for operational expansion (additional bays). The structural system (including any second-storey framing) must be designed to accommodate this.

Source: Addendum 03 §1.5 (p. 2).

## Considerations

### C-001: What "Key Accessibility Elements" Actually Means in This Context

The RFP §7.1.3 wording — "key accessibility elements if/as required by the Alberta Building Code" — is relatively brief. The evaluator is not expecting a full accessibility code audit; they are looking for demonstrated awareness of the code requirements and a credible design approach. The narrative should address:

- Barrier-free path of travel from public parking to building entrance to interior spaces to washrooms to egress
- Accessible washrooms (count, location, key features)
- Accessible signage (wayfinding, tactile, Braille elements)
- Universal design integration across all building zones (not just administrative areas)

The phrase "if/as required" acknowledges that some operational areas (apparatus bays, workshops) may have ABC exemptions or modified requirements for industrial/operations environments. The narrative should note this and confirm that accessible routes to all publicly-accessible and staff spaces will be provided to the code minimum, with universal design principles applied beyond those minimums where feasible.

Source: RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17).

### C-002: Accessible Signage Is an Optional Additional Item — Clarify Scope

Addendum 03 lists "Signage" as Additional Option 5 (and the OSR references signage in §10.3.11). The accessible signage described in the Accessibility Narrative (wayfinding, tactile, Braille) is a distinct scope item from building identification/exterior signage in Additional Option 5. The narrative should make this distinction clear: accessible wayfinding signage is a code requirement embedded in the base building, not an optional item. Building identification / branded signage is Optional Item 5.

Source: Addendum 03 §1.21; RFP Appendix B (Functional Program); OSR §10.3.11.

### C-003: Resilient Flooring Supports Accessibility

Addendum 03 §1.3 specifies that flooring should be "resilient material that can be easily cleaned of mud and dust such as sealed concrete." Sealed concrete, when properly finished (with appropriate surface texture/sealer for slip resistance), is compatible with accessibility requirements — it provides a level, smooth, firm, and stable surface that supports wheelchair and mobility aid travel. The narrative can note this alignment between the Owner's operational flooring preference and accessible design requirements.

Source: Addendum 03 §1.3 (p. 2); ASSUMPTION: specific slip-resistance requirements per ABC.

### C-004: Expansion Direction and the Site Map

The site map shown in Addendum 03 §1.1 (p. 1–2) identifies an "ideal cold storage location," "ideal stockpile location," and "area with engineered fill" on the 12-acre usable parcel. The map indicates the engineered fill area is positioned centrally/west, with the dog park and storm pond to the east on the flood fringe. Main building expansion scenarios should be consistent with the site layout shown — proposals for east expansion may be constrained by the flood fringe boundary. The narrative should acknowledge the site plan as the governing constraint for expansion direction.

Source: Addendum 03 §1.1, site map (p. 2).

### C-005: Distinguish Adaptability (Operational) from Expansion (Physical)

RFP §7.1.5 uses three terms: "adaptable to changing needs," "potential for future building expansion," and (by implication) flexible space planning. These are distinct concepts:

- **Adaptability:** Changing how existing spaces are used without adding square footage (e.g., converting an office to storage, reconfiguring workstation layouts, upgrading equipment)
- **Flexibility:** Interior layouts that allow reconfiguration with minimal cost (non-load-bearing partitions, accessible MEP connections, modular furniture zones)
- **Expansion:** Adding square footage — new bays, extended wings, second storey additions

The narrative should address all three distinctly. Evaluators will notice if "adaptability" is conflated entirely with "expansion."

Source: RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17).

### C-006: MEP Sizing for Future Loads

Mechanical, electrical, and IT systems designed for current loads only will require major re-work to support future expansion. Common future-proofing strategies include: oversized electrical panels with spare circuit capacity; HVAC systems with capacity for additional zones; plumbing rough-ins for future fixtures in expansion areas; IT conduit with spare capacity; generator sizing that accounts for future essential loads. These are relatively low-cost provisions at initial construction and should be described in the narrative as part of the expansion readiness strategy.

Source: ASSUMPTION — implied by RFP §7.1.5 and 50-year design life; standard practice in municipal facility design.

### C-007: Competitive Differentiation Through Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative

Beyond demonstrating regulatory compliance and technical competence, the accessibility and adaptability narrative is a competitive evaluation instrument. Under OBJ-004 (5 pts) and especially OBJ-005 (15 pts), evaluators will assess not only whether the Design-Builder meets requirements but whether the proposal demonstrates superior design thinking and value. The narrative should:

- **Go beyond compliance checklists** -- position accessibility and adaptability provisions as evidence of design maturity and owner-focused thinking, not merely code satisfaction.
- **Connect provisions to Owner outcomes** -- articulate how universal design reduces long-term operational cost, how expansion provisions protect the Town's capital investment, and how flexible layouts extend facility utility as Penhold grows.
- **Differentiate from competitors** -- competitors will likely cite ABC compliance and mention expansion capability; the narrative that quantifies future-readiness (e.g., spare electrical capacity, specific growth scenarios with timelines) and demonstrates integrated cross-discipline coordination will score higher.
- **Use specificity as a differentiator** -- concrete examples (bay module dimensions, expansion direction tied to site constraints, MEP spare capacity percentages) are more persuasive than generic statements about "future-proofing."

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Standard Accessibility Compliance vs. Universal Design Best Practice

| Dimension | Option A: ABC Minimum | Option B: Universal Design Best Practice |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Description** | Meet minimum accessible route widths, washroom counts, and signage per ABC | Exceed minimums: wider corridors, more accessible washrooms, fully integrated accessible workstations, higher-contrast signage |
| **Cost Implication** | Lower upfront cost | Moderate additional cost; often offset by wider operational benefits (e.g., wider corridors support equipment movement) |
| **Evaluation Signal** | Satisfies compliance; may not differentiate | Stronger Design Brief evaluation response; demonstrates design thinking beyond checkbox compliance |
| **Recommended Approach** | Meet ABC minimums as floor; select best-practice enhancements with operational co-benefits (e.g., wider corridors serve both accessibility and apparatus movement) | Source: RFP §7.1.3; OBJ-004 |

### T-002: Modular Interior Layouts vs. Fixed Efficient Layouts

| Dimension | Fixed Layouts | Modular / Flexible Layouts |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Description** | Load-bearing partitions, fixed casework, dedicated MEP service points | Non-load-bearing partitions, flexible casework, distributed MEP connections |
| **Cost Implication** | Lower initial cost; higher future renovation cost | Slightly higher initial cost; significantly lower future renovation cost |
| **Operational Fit** | Better suited to spaces with stable, well-defined functions (apparatus bays, mechanical rooms) | Better suited to spaces with evolving functions (offices, meeting rooms, training areas, shared spaces) |
| **Recommended Approach** | Apply modular approach selectively — administrative and shared spaces; fixed approach for high-services operational spaces | Source: RFP §7.1.5; ASSUMPTION |

### T-003: Horizontal Expansion vs. Second Storey Expansion

| Dimension | Horizontal Expansion | Second Storey Expansion |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Description** | Additional bays, wing extensions, satellite buildings on site | Additional floor(s) above existing or adjacent footprint |
| **Cost Implication** | Higher footprint cost (additional slab, foundation, roof); simpler construction | Higher structural cost upfront for storey support; lower ongoing footprint use |
| **Site Constraint** | Limited by 12-acre usable area; flood fringe and environmental no-build zones constrain direction | Less site-constrained; requires structural system designed for future storey addition |
| **ABC Implication** | Accessibility provisions for new areas must meet code at time of expansion | Second storey requires accessible vertical circulation (elevator or platform lift) — ABC compliance TBD |
| **Recommended Approach** | Horizontal expansion for operational spaces (bays); second storey for shared/administrative spaces (already permitted per Addendum 03 §1.5) | Source: Addendum 03 §1.5; RFP §7.1.5 |

## Examples

### EX-001: Accessibility Narrative — Illustrative Excerpt

*"The facility design embraces universal design principles, ensuring that all users — firefighting personnel, public works staff, administrative staff, and members of the public — can navigate and utilize the facility safely and independently, regardless of age, ability, or temporary condition.*

*Compliance with the Alberta Building Code accessibility requirements will be confirmed during detailed design and permitting; the following describes the Design-Builder's design intent:*

*Barrier-free path of travel is provided from accessible parking stalls (minimum 2 van-accessible stalls within the accessible parking area, located within the site's designated parking zone) through a level, ramped, or gently sloped approach (maximum 1:12 per ABC) to a main entrance with automatic door openers. Interior circulation provides minimum clear widths consistent with ABC requirements in all public and staff areas, with corridor widths in primary routes sized to support simultaneous movement of staff with mobility aids and operational equipment carts.*

*Two accessible washrooms are provided on the main floor, sized for 5-foot turning radius, with grab bars, accessible fixtures, and automatic door openers. Accessible signage (visual + tactile/Braille at all room entries and corridor junctions) is provided as a base building feature — distinct from the building identification/exterior signage addressed in Additional Option 5.*

*Accessible design extends to operational areas: fire apparatus bay work areas and public works workshop areas include accessible pathways to equipment, storage, and staff facilities. The sealed concrete flooring specified throughout (Addendum 03 §1.3) provides a level, firm surface compatible with mobility aid travel when finished with appropriate slip-resistant sealer."*

**Source note:** This is an illustrative example draft. The washroom count ("Two") cited above is illustrative only and not a requirement -- actual accessible washroom count is TBD pending ABC code analysis during detailed design (see Specification ACC-004, enriched per A-002). Actual narrative must cite specific ABC sections (to be confirmed during permitting) and align with DEL-02-01 floor plan.

### EX-002: Adaptability Narrative — Illustrative Excerpt

*"The facility is designed to accommodate the Town of Penhold's growth over its 50-year service life. The main building's structural system, MEP distribution, and interior layout strategy support future expansion without requiring demolition of primary structural elements.*

*Site and Building Expansion Capacity:*
*The 12-acre usable site (of 20 total acres; 8 acres designated as storm pond and dog park on flood fringe and not available for construction, per Addendum 03 §1.1) provides sufficient area for main building expansion. The proposed building footprint is positioned within the engineered fill area; future bay expansion is feasible to the [north/west/south — TBD per site plan DEL-02-02] without encroaching on the flood fringe or wetland constraints documented in the Wetland Assessment (Appendix D) and Environmental Assessment (Appendix D).*

*Structural Provisions for Expansion (coordinated with Structural Design Brief DEL-03-03):*
*The main building structural grid is designed to allow future bay additions using the same bay module (anticipated 30-foot clear span grid — TBD in structural design). The [north/south/east] exterior wall of the apparatus bay area is designed as a non-structural envelope element, enabling future removal and bay extension without affecting primary structural elements. Foundation sizing anticipates the load of [+1 to +2 future apparatus bays — TBD per geotechnical confirmation from 2021 Geotechnical Investigation Report, Appendix D].*

*MEP Future-Readiness:*
*Mechanical distribution (HVAC supply/return, plumbing) runs in a central utility corridor; future bay zones can be connected without disturbing current operations. The electrical main distribution panel is sized with spare capacity for future load expansion; IT conduit includes pull strings for future data cabling to new zones.*

*Operational Flexibility:*
*Administrative offices, training rooms, and shared spaces use non-load-bearing partitions throughout, enabling layout reconfiguration as staffing models and operational needs evolve. The second storey — acceptable for shared spaces per Addendum 03 §1.5 — provides a future option to relocate administrative functions vertically, freeing main-floor area for operational expansion.*"*

**Source note:** This is an illustrative example draft. All TBD items must be resolved during detailed design and confirmed in DEL-03-03 (Structural Brief), DEL-02-01 (Architectural Concept), and DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept).

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **CONF-01** | Scope of accessibility in operational areas: Does ABC require barrier-free access throughout apparatus bays and public works workshops, or only to staff areas within those zones? Industrial/operations spaces may have modified ABC requirements. | RFP §7.1.3 (universal design approach required); ABC Part 3.2 (location TBD) | RFP OSR §10.3 Scope of Work (describes operational spaces without accessibility specifics) | ACC-003, ACC-006; Specification; Guidance C-001 | **PROPOSAL:** Narrative states that accessible paths of travel are provided to all staff and public-accessible areas as a minimum; specific ABC requirements for industrial/operations areas to be confirmed by the Design-Builder's architect and code consultant during detailed design. | TBD |
| **CONF-02** | Expansion direction: The Addendum 03 site map suggests building location in the engineered fill area, but does not specify which direction horizontal expansion should occur. The flood fringe boundary constrains expansion direction. | Addendum 03 §1.1 site map (p. 2 of Addendum) | Site Grading Plan (Appendix E; not directly read); Wetland Assessment (Appendix D; not directly read) | ADAPT-002, ADAPT-005; Specification; Guidance C-004 | **PROPOSAL:** Narrative defers specific expansion direction to the civil and architectural concept (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02); marks expansion direction as TBD pending site plan confirmation. Human ruling not required — TBD resolution is appropriate at this stage. | TBD (design stage) |
| **CONF-03** | Cold Storage building adaptability: The RFP describes the Cold Storage as 60'×100' unheated equipment storage. No mention of expansion in RFP or Addendum 03. Should the adaptability narrative address Cold Storage expansion at all? | Addendum 03 §1.2 (Cold Storage defined; pickled sand storage excluded — Cold Storage remains); Decomposition (60'×100' Cold Storage described as fixed-scope structure) | RFP §7.1.5 ("site and building design" — could be interpreted to include all buildings on site) | ADAPT-002, ADAPT-005; Specification | **PROPOSAL:** Cold Storage building treated as fixed-scope in current narrative. Main building expansion is the primary adaptability focus. If Owner has Cold Storage expansion intent, this should be added via Owner direction during design development. | TBD |
| **CONF-04** | Cold Storage building accessibility: Specification ASSUM-04 excludes Cold Storage from adaptability scope, and CONF-03 addresses adaptability only. However, Datasheet "Buildings Covered" lists Cold Storage, and RFP SS7.1.5 references "site and building design" (plural). Does the Cold Storage building require accessibility narrative coverage (barrier-free access to the building entrance and any staff areas), separate from the adaptability exclusion? ABC may require barrier-free exterior approach and entrance even for unheated storage buildings used by staff. *(Enriched per X-002: expanded conflict scope to include accessibility for Cold Storage)* | Specification ASSUM-04 (Cold Storage fixed-scope); Datasheet Attributes "Buildings Covered" (Cold Storage listed) | RFP SS7.1.3 (accessibility for all "key elements"); ABC applicability to unheated staff-occupied storage buildings (TBD) | ACC-003, ACC-006, ASSUM-04; Specification; Datasheet | **PROPOSAL:** Human should rule whether Cold Storage requires accessibility narrative coverage (barrier-free entrance, accessible approach from parking area) in addition to the adaptability exclusion already flagged in CONF-03. If yes, add ACC-007 requirement to Specification. | TBD |

> **Terminology note (B-003):** This document uses "Alberta Building Code (ABC)" on first reference (see P-002 heading) and "ABC" thereafter, consistent with the canonical abbreviation convention established across all four documents.
