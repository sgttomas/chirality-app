# Deliverable: DEL-03-06 Accessibility and Adaptability Narrative

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable is a cross-discipline design narrative that must convey how a public services facility integrates inclusive access for all users and accommodates long-term growth -- spanning barrier-free design, universal accessibility, flexible space planning, and structural/site provisions for future expansion. The knowledge it carries bridges regulatory compliance (building code accessibility) with strategic foresight (50-year adaptability), ensuring that evaluators see both immediate design integrity and enduring operational resilience.
