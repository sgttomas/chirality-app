## Conditions

| Condition | Status | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Accessibility Standards — Governing Code** | Alberta Building Code (ABC) applies; specific edition and clause numbers TBD during detailed design. **TBD Resolution Owner:** Architect / Code Consultant; **Target Milestone:** prior to 60% Detailed Design submission. *(Enriched per A-001: resolution ownership and milestone assigned)* | RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17) |
| **Universal Design Approach** | Required as part of accessibility narrative | RFP §7.1.3 |
> **Terminology note (B-003):** This document uses "Alberta Building Code (ABC)" on first reference and "ABC" thereafter, consistent with the canonical abbreviation convention established across all four documents.
| **Barrier-Free Path of Travel** | Required; exterior and interior; scope of application to operational areas (bays) = TBD | RFP §7.1.3; ABC interpretation |
| **Accessible Washrooms** | Required; number, location, and design features TBD during detailed design | RFP §7.1.3 |
| **Accessible Signage** | Required; tactile / visual strategy TBD during detailed design | RFP §7.1.3 |
| **Adaptability to Changing Needs** | Required; site and building design must demonstrate adaptability | RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17) |
| **Future Building Expansion** | Structural design must consider future expansion; coordinated with Structural Design Brief | RFP §7.1.5 referencing §7.1.2.3 |
| **Flexible Space Planning** | Required; interior layout must accommodate changing operational needs | RFP §7.1.5 |
| **Site Expansion Constraints** | Storm pond and dog park on flood fringe = no-build (8 acres); 12 usable acres set expansion envelope | Addendum 03 §1.1 |
| **Floor Finish (Accessibility-Relevant)** | Resilient, cleanable surface (e.g., sealed concrete) specified for main building | Addendum 03 §1.3 — ASSUMPTION: sealed concrete supports level, non-slip accessible floors |

## Construction

| Element | Description | Source / Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Accessibility Narrative Section** | Narrative covering: Alberta Building Code compliance approach; universal design principles; barrier-free path of travel (exterior + interior); accessible washrooms; accessible signage; mobility aid accommodation | RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17) |
| **Adaptability Narrative Section** | Narrative covering: site and building design adaptability to changing needs; future building expansion potential; structural provisions for expansion; flexible space planning; operational adaptability | RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17) |
