## Requirements

### Accessibility Narrative (RFP §7.1.3)

The RFP states (p. 17): *"Provide a narrative describing accommodation of key accessibility elements if/as required by the Alberta Building Code."*

| Req ID | Statement | Source | Verification Approach |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **ACC-001** | Narrative describes the approach to meeting Alberta Building Code accessibility requirements | RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17) | Narrative explicitly references ABC by title (specific edition/clauses TBD during detailed design); describes how compliance is achieved |
| **ACC-002** | Narrative explains the universal design approach — inclusive design principles applicable to all users regardless of age or ability | RFP §7.1.3 (p. 17) | Narrative includes a stated philosophy and demonstrates integration of universal design into facility design from concept stage |
| **ACC-003** | Narrative describes barrier-free path of travel throughout the facility, covering exterior approach and interior circulation | RFP §7.1.3 | Narrative defines accessible routes, entrances, accessible parking, interior circulation, and emergency egress for mobility-impaired users |
| **ACC-004** | Narrative specifies accessible washroom provisions: locations, count, and design features. **Note:** Accessible washroom count is TBD pending ABC code analysis during detailed design; any count cited in Guidance examples (e.g., EX-001) is illustrative only and not a requirement. *(Enriched per A-002)* | RFP §7.1.3 | Narrative identifies accessible washroom locations, size/turning radius, grab bars, fixture approach, and door hardware; washroom count confirmed during detailed design per ABC analysis |
| **ACC-005** | Narrative describes accessible signage strategy, including wayfinding and room identification | RFP §7.1.3 | Narrative outlines signage types (visual, tactile, Braille), placement strategy, and high-contrast approach for wayfinding |
| **ACC-006** | Narrative addresses mobility aid access throughout the facility, including in operational areas (apparatus bays, public works workshops) | ASSUMPTION: Implied by universal design mandate in RFP §7.1.3; extent of accessibility in operational areas subject to ABC determination during detailed design | Narrative covers accessible parking, accessible entrances, clear circulation widths, and accessible workstation approach in operational areas |

> **ASSUMPTION:** The Alberta Building Code specific edition and clause numbers applicable to this facility are not provided in the RFP or Addenda. The narrative will reference the Alberta Building Code by title and cite applicable part/section designations as TBD, to be confirmed by the Design-Builder's architect and code consultant during the detailed design and permitting phase.

### Adaptability, Flexibility, and Potential for Expansion Narrative (RFP §7.1.5)

The RFP states (p. 17): *"Demonstrate how the site and building design are adaptable to changing needs and accommodate the potential for future building expansion. The structural design of the building should also consider these points (see Section 7.1.2.3 — Structural Design Brief)."*

| Req ID | Statement | Source | Verification Approach |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **ADAPT-001** | Narrative demonstrates how the site and building design are adaptable to changing operational needs over the facility's 50-year lifespan | RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17) | Narrative identifies design strategies enabling operational reconfiguration (layout, equipment, staffing) without major renovation |
| **ADAPT-002** | Narrative demonstrates how the building accommodates the potential for future building expansion | RFP §7.1.5 (p. 17) | Narrative describes expansion approach (direction, scale, phasing) with site context constraints acknowledged |
| **ADAPT-003** | Narrative addresses structural provisions for future expansion, coordinated with Structural Design Brief (DEL-03-03) | RFP §7.1.5 cross-reference to §7.1.2.3 | Narrative references structural grid/column layout, foundation sizing for future loads, and utility chase routing; aligned with DEL-03-03 language |
| **ADAPT-004** | Narrative describes flexible space planning approach — interior layouts allowing reconfiguration without structural changes | RFP §7.1.5 | Narrative addresses non-load-bearing partition use, modular equipment arrangements, and scalable MEP distribution |
| **ADAPT-005** | Narrative acknowledges site constraints that define the expansion envelope — flood fringe no-build area (8 acres = storm pond + dog park), wetlands, environmental constraints | Addendum 03 §1.1; site reference documents (Appendices D, E) | Narrative confirms that proposed expansion scenarios are within the 12-acre usable site and outside no-build zones |

> **ASSUMPTION:** The RFP does not specify target expansion scale (e.g., number of additional bays, square footage growth target, or timeline milestones). The Design-Builder is expected to propose reasonable 20–50 year growth scenarios with stated rationale. No Owner-provided growth projections were located in the RFP or Addenda.

> **ASSUMPTION:** Cold Storage building (60'×100') — Addendum 03 does not address expansion of the Cold Storage building. It is assumed to be a fixed-scope structure in its current form. Main building expansion is the primary adaptability focus.
