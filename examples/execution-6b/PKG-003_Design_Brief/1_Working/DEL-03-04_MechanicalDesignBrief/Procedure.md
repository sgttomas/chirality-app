# Procedure — DEL-03-04: Mechanical Design Brief

---

## Purpose

This procedure documents the process for authoring and finalizing the Mechanical Design Brief (DEL-03-04) for the Penhold PSB Design-Build proposal. The brief is one of five discipline sub-briefs required under RFP §7.1.2, and contributes to the Design Brief scoring criterion (OBJ-004, 5 pts total).

The procedure ensures:

- All seven Addendum 03 mechanical clarifications are visibly incorporated (M-001 through M-007)
- All six RFP §7.1.2(4) brief topics are present (D-001 through D-006)
- Mechanical system selections are explicitly rationale-justified, not just listed
- The brief aligns with and does not duplicate sibling deliverables: energy efficiency quantification and solar readiness are excluded (covered in DEL-04-02); detailed lifecycle cost analysis and maintenance scheduling are excluded (covered in DEL-05-03); concept design decisions are explained, not originated (upstream from DEL-02-04)
- Cross-discipline coordination is confirmed before submission

## Steps

### Step 1 — Review Scope and Establish Checklist (1–2 hours)

**Action:**

1. Read RFP §7.1.2(4): note the six brief topics explicitly named (systems selection rationale, heating/cooling, ventilation by zone, plumbing, fire protection, generator/emergency power)
2. Read Addendum 03 §1 mechanical items: transcribe the seven mechanical requirements (M-001 through M-007 per this Specification)
3. Read this Specification.md fully: internalize requirements R-A, R-B, R-C, R-D
4. Read this Guidance.md fully: note principles P-001 through P-005 and all Considerations C-001 through C-005
5. Create a **Mechanical Brief Authoring Checklist** using the template below. Track status of each item across procedure steps using the defined status values.

**Checklist Template — Mechanical Brief Authoring Checklist:**

- **Reviewed** — content reviewed by cross-discipline team and/or Design Manager (set during Step 5 or Step 6)

The checklist is the primary tracking mechanism for Addendum 03 compliance across procedure steps. The Mechanical Engineer updates status after each step; the Design Manager verifies all items reach "Reviewed" before Step 7 signoff.

**Addendum 03 Compliance Pre-Check (7 items — must all be present in final brief):**

| # | Addendum 03 Item | Req ID | Target Brief Section |
|---|---|---|---|

| 6 | Generator minimum loads (kitchen, ICP, 2 bathrooms, bay door) | M-006 | Generator and Emergency Power |
| 7 | Bay door secondary opening mechanism | M-007 | Generator and Emergency Power |

**Completion Criterion:** Checklist created and agreed by Mechanical Engineer and Design Manager.

### Step 2 — Align with Mechanical Concept Narrative (DEL-02-04) (2–3 hours)

**Action:**

1. Obtain draft or final DEL-02-04
   - If DEL-02-04 does not yet exist: Mechanical Engineer must first draft the concept narrative, as the design brief explains and justifies the concept decisions
   - If DEL-02-04 is in draft: proceed; the brief may inform final concept choices

2. **Concept Alignment Checks:**

| Check | Question | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Heating strategy | Does concept name a heating approach (hydronic, unit heaters, radiant, other)? | Yes — brief explains this choice |
| Apparatus bay exhaust | Does concept specify "direct exhaust" for fire bays? | Yes — brief justifies direct exhaust |
| Generator minimum loads | Does concept name all four Addendum 03 generator loads? | Yes — brief articulates philosophy |
| Fill stations | Does concept include 2" fill stations in fire and PW bays? | Yes — brief includes in plumbing section |
| Sumps | Does concept include bay floor sumps? | Yes — brief includes with structural coordination note |
| Cold Storage | Does concept correctly exclude heating from Cold Storage? | Yes — brief confirms unheated scope |

3. **Open Issues from Alignment Check:**
   - If any Addendum 03 item is missing from DEL-02-04, flag to Mechanical Engineer and Design Manager as an OPEN ISSUE before proceeding; do not proceed to Step 3 until concept includes all Addendum 03 items
   - Document coordination questions arising from this alignment (e.g., sump pump discharge routing — storm or sanitary; structural confirmation of slab sump recesses; generator fuel utility availability)

**Completion Criterion:** Concept narrative confirmed to include all Addendum 03 mechanical items; any gaps flagged and assigned to responsible party.

---

### Step 3 — Establish System Selections and Rationale (4–6 hours)

**Action:**

For each of the six brief topic areas, confirm the system selection and prepare rationale notes before drafting:

**Heating and Cooling:**

| Zone | System Selection | Rationale Note |
|---|---|---|
| Fire apparatus bays | TBD (central hydronic or gas unit heaters; see Guidance T-001) | State 50-year lifecycle fit; zone independence; cold Alberta climate design temp |
| PW bays | TBD | State occupancy pattern (intermittent); lower comfort standard vs. apparatus bays |
| Residential quarters | TBD | State 24/7 occupancy; reliability; quiet operation |
| Office / admin | TBD | Standard institutional; schedule-based control |
| Shared spaces (ICP/kitchen) | TBD | Generator-backed; must remain functional during outage |
| Cold Storage | No heating — unheated per Addendum 03 | Explicitly state: no HVAC scope |
| Cooling | TBD (Alberta climate; apparatus bays may not need cooling; office may require split system or rooftop unit) | State Alberta cooling load rationale |

**Ventilation by Zone (per Addendum 03 and code):**

| Zone | Strategy | Key Parameter | Addendum 03 Item |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fire apparatus bay | Direct non-recirculated exhaust; heated makeup air | Designed for 2 apparatus/bay; rate TBD | M-001 |
| PW bay | General exhaust ventilation | Occasional idling; rare welding; no dedicated welding exhaust | M-002 |
| Bunker gear room | Room-level supply/exhaust or exhaust-only | 40 lockers; moisture/odor control | M-003 |
| Residential quarters | Balanced ventilation (ERV recommended) | Quiet operation; ASHRAE 62.2 rate | — |
| Office areas | Standard supply/exhaust; demand-control option | ASHRAE 62.1 rate | — |
| Kitchen | Range hood exhaust + makeup air | Cooking exhaust; makeup air balanced | — |
| Bathrooms | Standard exhaust | Per code; generator-backed for two bathrooms | M-006 |
| Mechanical room | Combustion air supply; equipment heat rejection | Boiler combustion air per manufacturer | — |

**Plumbing:**
- Confirm water supply source (municipal; connection point TBD in civil)
- Select hot water system type (storage tank vs. on-demand); state rationale
- Confirm fill station configuration: 2" minimum, backflow preventer, isolation valve, freeze protection strategy
- Confirm sump pump configuration: float switch, discharge route, oil/water separation if required
- Confirm grease trap requirement (kitchen — TBD per AHJ)

**Fire Protection:**
- Select sprinkler system type: wet for heated spaces (main building); dry for Cold Storage if sprinkler coverage required (TBD); confirm via AHJ
- Confirm fire alarm integration (NFPA 72 or equivalent; UPS backup for control panel)
- Identify whether fire pump is needed based on municipal supply pressure (TBD in civil coordination)

**Generator and Emergency Power:**
- List minimum loads verbatim from Addendum 03: kitchen, ICP/meeting room, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening
- Select fuel type (diesel vs. natural gas); state rationale (see Guidance T-002)
- Estimate size range: TBD (likely 20–50 kW for minimum loads; actual calculation in detailed design)
- Confirm fuel storage approach (on-site tank; capacity for 72-hour runtime — ASSUMPTION)
- Confirm ATS type (automatic transfer switch; timed delay to prevent rapid cycling)
- Confirm secondary door opening type (manual hand-crank; hydraulic backup; gravity release)

**Design Life Rationale (for each system):**
- Hydronic/unit heater systems: boiler 20–25 years; unit heaters 15–20 years; piping 50+ years — all within or spanning 50-year life
- Sprinkler piping: 30–50 years depending on material and water quality
- Generator: 20–30 years with annual maintenance
- Plumbing: copper or PEX domestic lines 40–50 years
- ASSUMPTION: Specific lifecycle figures location TBD; aligned with standard industry practice for institutional buildings in Alberta

**Completion Criterion:** All system selections confirmed; rationale prepared in notes; Design Manager agrees selections are credible and defensible before drafting begins.

```

**Drafting Tips:**
- Be decisive — state system choices clearly; use "will" not "would" or "may"
- State Addendum 03 items explicitly — name each item and the design response
- Justify every major selection with at least one sentence explaining why (not just what)
- Keep each zone distinct in the ventilation section — evaluators will check for zone-by-zone coverage
- Scope boundary: Energy efficiency quantification and solar readiness are excluded (covered in DEL-04-02); detailed lifecycle cost analysis and maintenance scheduling are excluded (covered in DEL-05-03). Introduce design life rationale per system but cross-reference those deliverables for detail.
- Use consistent terminology: "apparatus bay" (not "engine bay" or "fire bay"), "Public Works bay" (not "workshop bay"), "ICP" (not "command center"), "Addendum 03" (not "the addendum")

**Addendum 03 Inline Completion Check — confirm before moving to Step 5:**

- [ ] §4 Ventilation section: "direct exhaust" and "2 apparatus per bay" appear (M-001)
- [ ] §4 Ventilation section: PW bay "general ventilation" for "occasional idling" and "very occasional welding" appear (M-002)
- [ ] §4 Ventilation section: Bunker gear room "room-level ventilation" for "40 lockers" appears (M-003)
- [ ] §5 Plumbing section: "2" minimum" fill stations in "fire apparatus bay" and "Public Works bay" appear (M-004)
- [ ] §5 Plumbing section: "bay floor sumps" for "snow meltwater" and "minor washing" appear (M-005)
- [ ] §7 Generator section: "kitchen, ICP/meeting room, two bathrooms, bay door secondary opening" all appear (M-006)
- [ ] §7 Generator section: "secondary opening mechanism" for bay doors described (M-007)

**Completion Criterion:** First complete draft with all sections present; all Addendum 03 items inline; ready for interdisciplinary review.

---

### Step 5 — Cross-Discipline Coordination Review (2–3 hours)

**Action:**

Circulate draft brief to structural, electrical, civil, and architectural team members for targeted review:

**Structural Engineer review (focus areas):**
- [ ] Sump construction described accurately? (Mechanical provides pump; structural provides pit — confirmed?)
- [ ] Equipment support loads (boiler, AHUs) noted for structural confirmation?
- [ ] Penetrations through structural elements noted?

**Electrical Engineer review (focus areas):**
- [ ] Power requirements for HVAC, pumps, and controls acknowledged?
- [ ] Generator and ATS integration described accurately and consistently with Electrical/IT concept (DEL-02-05)?
- [ ] Generator power for fire apparatus bay exhaust fans (if in scope beyond Addendum 03 minimum) addressed?

**Civil Engineer review (focus areas):**
- [ ] Sump discharge routing to storm or sanitary correctly characterized?
- [ ] Utility connections (gas, water) described consistently with civil concept (DEL-02-02)?
- [ ] Oil/water separation requirement acknowledged?

**Architect review (focus areas):**
- [ ] Mechanical room size and location feasible based on concept plan (DEL-02-01)?
- [ ] Generator outdoor location coordinated with site plan?
- [ ] Ductwork routing feasible given 16 ft overhead door height in apparatus bays?

**Design Manager QC — full checklist:**

| Item | Check | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6 RFP §7.1.2(4) topics | All present? | — |
| 7 Addendum 03 items | All visible by name? | — |
| Rationale quality | Each major selection justified? | — |
| 50-year design life | Explicitly addressed? | — |
| Scope boundaries | No duplication of DEL-04-02 or DEL-05-03? | — |
| Terminology | Consistent with Decomposition Vocabulary Map? | — |
| Conflict Table | CONF-01 through CONF-03 from Guidance acknowledged? | — |

**Cross-Deliverable Reference Accuracy Check:**
- [ ] Confirm all cross-deliverable references (DEL-02-04, DEL-04-02, DEL-05-03, DEL-03-02, DEL-03-03, DEL-03-05, DEL-02-01, DEL-02-03, DEL-02-05) are accurate: verify deliverable IDs, names, and relationship descriptions are consistent with current versions of those deliverables
- [ ] Confirm Datasheet References table and Specification Documentation table cross-references match the brief narrative cross-references

**Conflict Resolution:**
- CONF-01 (generator runtime): Confirm whether 72-hour target is stated as an ASSUMPTION; add "to be confirmed post-award"
- CONF-02 (bay door mechanism type): Confirm brief describes mechanism as TBD or proposes preferred option
- CONF-03 (Cold Storage scope): Confirm brief explicitly states Cold Storage is unheated and excluded from mechanical scope

**Note on Independent QA:** Step 5 cross-discipline review is performed by team members who also contribute to the deliverable. For this proposal-stage deliverable, a separate independent quality assurance reviewer outside the project team is not included. Rationale: (1) the Design Brief is a proposal narrative scored at 5 pts total across five disciplines, where technical credibility is best verified by the contributing discipline leads who understand the design rationale; (2) the Proposal Manager compliance check in Step 6 provides an additional layer of non-technical review; (3) formal independent QA review is more appropriate at detailed design stage when engineering calculations and code compliance require third-party verification. If the proposal team determines that an external reviewer would add value for scoring strategy, this step may be expanded accordingly. **ASSUMPTION: current review structure is adequate for proposal-stage deliverables.**

**Completion Criterion:** All review comments received and incorporated or documented; no outstanding cross-discipline conflicts; Conflict Table items addressed in brief; all cross-deliverable references verified accurate.

---

### Step 6 — Proposal Manager Compliance and Format Check (1–2 hours)

**Action:**

1. Confirm brief is positioned under RFP §7.1.2 (Design Brief) in proposal section order (per RFP §4.3 / Constraint C-02 in Decomposition)
2. Format check:
   - Heading hierarchy consistent with proposal standards (H1 for brief title, H2 for sections, H3 for zones/subsystems)
   - Terminology consistent with Decomposition Vocabulary Map (Owner, Proponent, ICP, apparatus bay, OSR, etc.)
   - Figures or diagrams (zoning schematic, generator block diagram) embedded or referenced per proposal graphic standards
3. Length: Confirm approximately 2–4 pages of narrative is appropriate (ASSUMPTION: no RFP page limit; consistent with comparable municipal design-build proposals)
4. Compliance cross-check:
   - Brief answers: "Why are these mechanical systems appropriate for Penhold PSB?" — Yes/No
   - Brief demonstrates: Addendum 03 compliance, operations-fit design, 50-year design life rationale — Yes/No
   - Brief does NOT claim energy analysis (DEL-04-02 scope) or maintenance schedule detail (DEL-05-03 scope)
5. File: Confirm filename and location per project file naming standard

**Completion Criterion:** Compliance confirmed; format approved; brief ready for final signoff.

---

### Step 7 — Final Approval and Submission Readiness (1 hour)

**Action:**

1. Mechanical Engineer signs off: Technical content is accurate, defensible, and current with design decisions
2. Design Manager approves: RFP compliance confirmed; cross-discipline coordination reflected
3. Proposal Manager approves: Format, placement in proposal PDF, file naming confirmed
4. Brief placed in deliverable location and flagged as COMPLETE for proposal assembly

**Completion Criterion:** All approvals obtained; document ready for inclusion in the Penhold PSB proposal PDF.
