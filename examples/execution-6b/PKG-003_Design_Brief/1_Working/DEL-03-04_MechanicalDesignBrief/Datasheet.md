## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Climate** | Penhold, Alberta — prairie climate; extreme cold winters (ASHRAE 99% heating design temperature approximately −33°C, Red Deer region proxy); significant freeze-thaw exposure. **Note:** Red Deer is the nearest ASHRAE station proxy for Penhold; certified ASHRAE design temperature for the specific project site to be confirmed with ASHRAE Climatic Design Conditions data prior to detailed design sizing. | ASSUMPTION (Penhold location used; ASHRAE 99% dry-bulb for Red Deer as nearest proxy; exact certified value to be confirmed — resolution trigger: detailed design kickoff) |
| **Fire Apparatus Bay Exhaust** | Direct (non-recirculated) exhaust required; designed for 2 apparatus per bay | Addendum 03 §1 (as summarized in Decomposition §4) |
| **Public Works Bay Ventilation** | General ventilation for occasional short-term vehicle idling and very occasional welding; dedicated welding ventilation NOT required | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Bunker Gear Room Ventilation** | Room-level ventilation approach required; room hosts 40 bunker gear lockers | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Water Fill Stations** | One 2" minimum in fire apparatus bay; one 2" minimum in Public Works bay | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Bay Floor Sumps** | All bays require sumps for snow meltwater and minor washing | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Backup Generator — Minimum Loads** | Kitchen, ICP/meeting room, two bathrooms, bay door secondary opening mechanism | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Bay Door Secondary Opening** | Apparatus bay doors must have secondary opening mechanism (power or manual backup) | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Solar-Ready Roof** | Roof orientation: flat, south, west, or southwest; mechanical rough-ins for future solar coordinated with DEL-04-02 | Addendum 03 §1 (Decomposition §4) |
| **Pickled Sand Storage** | Excluded from this proposal; no mechanical scope for that building | Addendum 03 §1.2 (Decomposition C-10) |
| **Natural Gas Utility** | Availability of natural gas utility service at site: TBD — resolution required for generator fuel selection (T-002) and heating plant selection. Confirm with civil/utility coordination during detailed design. | TBD (utility coordination needed; referenced in Guidance T-002 and C-005) |
| **Geotechnical Reference** | Design based on existing 2021 geotechnical investigation report only; no additional investigation | Decomposition DEC-013 |
