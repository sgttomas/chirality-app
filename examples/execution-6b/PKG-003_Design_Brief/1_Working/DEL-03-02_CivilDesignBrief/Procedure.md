# Procedure — DEL-03-02: Civil Design Brief

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps for producing, reviewing, and finalizing the Civil Design Brief narrative (DEL-03-02). The brief is a narrative document authored by the Civil Engineer covering all seven topics required by RFP Section 7.1.2(2): parking design, street access, surface drainage, stormwater management, grading strategy, utility connections, and site servicing approach.

The output is a clear, persuasive narrative that explains civil design decisions and demonstrates the Design-Builder's understanding of the site, operational requirements, and RFP compliance. It supports OBJ-004 (Design Brief, 5 pts).

## Steps

### Step 1: Assign and Orient the Civil Engineer

**Action:**
1. Confirm the Civil Engineer is assigned as the responsible author per Decomposition §9 and DEC-007.
2. Provide the Civil Engineer with:
   - RFP §7.1.2(2) — Civil Design Brief scope requirements
   - Addendum 03 (full text) — special requirements and cash allowance clause §1.7
   - Draft DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan) — the design this brief explains
   - Site condition reports (Appendix D and E, flood zone mapping)
   - This Procedure document (Guidance.md and Specification.md for context)
3. Confirm Civil Engineer has reviewed DEL-02-02 and understands that the brief is the written rationale for decisions already shown in the concept — not a new, independent document.

**Verification (V-CDB-01):** Civil Engineer has all inputs and confirms readiness to draft.

### Step 2: Draft the Seven Topic Sections

**Action:** The Civil Engineer writes a narrative covering the following seven sections in the order listed. Each section should be substantive — not a statement of intent, but an explanation of *why* each decision was made and how it responds to site conditions and operational requirements.

#### 2.1 Parking Design Rationale
- State proposed parking count and justification (staffing levels, operational needs, code minimums — ASSUMPTION: specific count TBD by design team).
- Explain parking location on site and why it is appropriate (apparatus access, solar orientation of building, proximity to entry, winter management).
- Address accessible parking: quantity and location per Alberta Building Code (specific minimum TBD at permit stage).
- Describe winter management: snow storage areas, plowing lanes, surface treatment approach.
- Explain surface drainage from parking: catch basins, swales, slope direction, protection of downstream stormwater from parking lot contamination.
- Target length: 0.5–1 page.

#### 2.2 Street Access Approach
- Describe primary emergency apparatus access from Waskasoo Avenue North: dedicated lane or shared access, apparatus turning radius, staging areas on-site.
- Describe public and visitor vehicle access: curb cut location(s), traffic flow, separation from apparatus circulation.
- Describe pedestrian access: walkway from parking and street entry to building, level and accessible route, winter maintenance consideration.
- Describe service/delivery vehicle access for Public Works operations.
- Explain coordination with Town road authority: access permit, sight distance, any required traffic improvements (ASSUMPTION: standard access permit from Town required — confirm with Town of Penhold).
- Target length: 0.75–1.5 pages.

#### 2.3 Surface Drainage Design
- Describe parking lot drainage: catch basins at low points, drainage direction, connection to site storm system.
- Describe building perimeter drainage: grading sloped away from building; perimeter interceptor drains if geotechnical conditions indicate groundwater risk.
- Describe roof drainage: downspout routing to site storm system; no discharge against foundation or across accessible pedestrian routes.
- Confirm that design avoids ponding at low points.
- Address bay sump drainage routing: apparatus bay and PW bay sumps (Addendum 03) drain from slab level; describe how sump discharge is routed through site drainage (connection to sanitary sewer or approved grey water system — coordinate with Mechanical Engineer for final routing).
- Address seasonal drainage performance (freeze-thaw resilience; drainage structures designed for Alberta climate conditions).
- Target length: 0.5–1 page.

#### 2.4 Stormwater Management Strategy
- Describe overall stormwater management approach: on-site detention, controlled discharge to Town storm main, or combination.
- Explain the relationship between the 12-acre development area and the 8-acre storm pond/flood fringe: is the storm pond the receiving body or is the Town main the discharge point? (ASSUMPTION: Town storm main tie-in is anticipated; cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.7 covers this connection. Storm pond on flood fringe is not filled or developed.)
- Describe water quality approach: sediment settling swales, oil/water separation for parking lot runoff, or reliance on Town treatment system.
- Confirm environmental compliance: wetland setbacks maintained (Appendix D), flood fringe boundaries respected, discharge rates meet Alberta Environment standards (specific standards TBD at detailed design).
- State cash allowance assumption clearly: off-site storm main tie-in engineering, permitting, and construction are in the cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.7; on-site stormwater infrastructure is in the base scope.
- Target length: 0.75–1.5 pages.

#### 2.5 Grading Strategy
- Reference Appendix E (Site Grading) as the existing-conditions baseline; describe the existing site grades (specific elevations TBD — Appendix E is the source).
- Describe the proposed cut/fill strategy: balanced on-site, or material import/export anticipated (state assumption and rationale).
- Address slope stabilization if slopes exceed stable angles (vegetation, geotextiles, retaining structures proportional to site conditions).
- Address erosion control during construction: silt fences, erosion blankets, temporary seeding per Alberta Environment requirements.
- Confirm grading supports positive drainage away from the building perimeter and accommodates the building's foundation drainage (coordinate with Structural Engineer).
- Confirm flood fringe boundary is respected: no filling in the 8-acre flood fringe zone.
- Target length: 0.75–1 page.

#### 2.6 Utility Connections
- Identify utility availability on Waskasoo Avenue North: water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, natural gas, electrical, telecommunications (ASSUMPTION: municipal utilities available on Waskasoo Avenue North — confirm with Town and utility providers at detailed design).
- Describe on-site utility routing from proposed tie-in points to the building: routing path, assumed depths, conflict avoidance with structural elements and mechanical/electrical zones.
- Address building-specific utility demands:
  - Two 2-inch water fill stations (one fire apparatus bay, one PW bay per Addendum 03): dedicated supply runs required.
  - Bay sump drainage connections to sanitary sewer.
  - Generator fuel supply (connection to natural gas main or on-site diesel storage — coordinate with Mechanical Engineer for generator fuel type).
  - Electrical service entry for the building (size and transformer location — coordinate with Electrical Engineer).
- State that detailed utility design will follow award once survey files are available (survey files provided to award winner by civil engineering firm per Addendum 03).
- Target length: 0.75–1 page.

#### 2.7 Site Servicing Approach
- State the cash allowance basis clearly: per Addendum 03 §1.7, site servicing tie-in costs are addressed via cash allowance and are NOT included in the base proposal price.
- Define base scope: on-site utility distribution (building to tie-in points), site grading, drainage infrastructure, paving, and landscaping.
- Define cash allowance scope: off-site main extensions, utility relocations if required, municipal access permitting, tie-in engineering and construction.
- Note the survey timing: survey files provided to award winner after contract award; detailed tie-in design occurs post-award within the cash allowance framework.
- Acknowledge that post-award utility survey may reveal conflicts or revised tie-in locations; the cash allowance accommodates this without affecting base contract price.
- Target length: 0.5 page.

**Verification (V-CDB-02):** All seven sections drafted with substantive rationale. Civil Engineer self-reviews against RFP §7.1.2(2) checklist.

### Step 3: Integrate Addendum 03 Requirements

**Action:** Review the complete draft against the following Addendum 03 checklist items. Each must be visibly addressed in the brief.

| Addendum 03 Item | Integration Point in Brief | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| 12-acre developable site (not 20) | Grading (§2.5) and Site Servicing (§2.7) | State that development scope is 12 acres; 8 acres (pond + dog park) remain undeveloped |
| Pickled sand storage EXCLUDED | All sections | Confirm no reference to pickled sand storage |
| Bay sumps required in all bays | Surface Drainage (§2.3) and Utility Connections (§2.6) | Address sump drainage routing |
| 2-inch fill stations (1 fire bay, 1 PW bay) | Utility Connections (§2.6) | Address dedicated water supply runs for fill stations |
| Solar-capable roof orientation | Parking and Access (§2.1, §2.2) | Note that building orientation (south/southwest roof exposure) informed site layout; parking and access layout supports this |
| Site servicing cash allowance | Site Servicing (§2.7) | State explicitly that tie-in costs are in the cash allowance |
| Survey files provided after award | Utility Connections (§2.6) and Site Servicing (§2.7) | Note post-award survey timing |

**Verification (V-CDB-03):** All Addendum 03 checklist items confirmed in the draft brief.

---

### Step 4: Cross-Check Against Concept and Sibling Briefs

**Action:**
1. Confirm that the brief rationale is internally consistent with DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan): if the brief states "parking on the east side," the drawings must show east-side parking.
2. Confirm that utility connection descriptions are consistent with DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept) for service points and sump routing.
3. Share the draft with the Architect (Design Coordinator) for brief-package-level consistency check with DEL-03-01 (Architectural Design Brief): site layout descriptions should be consistent.
4. Check terminology against the decomposition vocabulary map (§5): use "apparatus bay," "PW bay," "Cold Storage," "Design-Builder," "Owner," "Town" — not synonyms or abbreviations that differ from project standards.
5. Document any conflicts found; if a conflict cannot be resolved from available information, record it in the Conflict Table in Guidance.md.

**Verification (V-CDB-04):** Brief is cross-checked with DEL-02-02 and DEL-03-01; no unresolved conflicts.

---

### Step 5: Quality Check and Finalize

**Action:**
1. Run the complete Specification.md requirements checklist (R-CDB-01 through R-CDB-16, R-CDB-App-D, R-CDB-OBJ-004) against the draft:

| Check | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|
| All 7 RFP §7.1.2(2) topics addressed | Yes — with substantive content |
| Civil Engineer credited as author | Yes — author attribution in document |
| 12-acre site area stated correctly | Yes — 12 acres developable; 8 acres flood fringe |
| Cash allowance statement present | Yes — Addendum 03 §1.7 referenced |
| No pickled sand storage references | Yes — none found |
| 2021 geotechnical basis stated | Yes — explicit statement |
| Parking rationale: separation, accessible, winter | Yes — all elements addressed |
| Access rationale: apparatus, public, pedestrian | Yes — all elements addressed |
| Stormwater: storm pond relationship addressed | Yes — flood fringe acknowledged |
| Grading: Appendix E referenced | Yes — as baseline |
| Bay sump drainage routing addressed | Yes — in drainage or utility section |
| Survey timing stated | Yes — post-award |
| Cold Storage siting addressed | Yes — in site layout rationale |
| Consistent with DEL-02-02 | Yes — confirmed in Step 4 |
| Vocabulary consistent with decomposition §5 | Yes — confirmed in Step 4 |
| Each section provides substantive rationale (R-CDB-16) | Yes — three-part test: explains why, references site condition, connects to need |
| Wetland and Environmental Assessment reports referenced (R-CDB-App-D) | Yes — in stormwater, drainage, and/or grading sections |
| Brief calibrated to OBJ-004 evaluation criteria (R-CDB-OBJ-004) | Yes — evaluation criteria referenced or mapped |

2. Review tone: is the brief persuasive and professionally credible? Does it demonstrate operations-awareness, not just code compliance?
3. Final approval by Architect/Design Coordinator before integration into the Design Brief package.

**Rework path (if quality check fails):** If any checklist item does not pass, the following corrective action applies (Enrichment: D-001, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md):
   - **Minor deficiencies** (missing statement, inconsistent terminology, weak rationale in one section): Return to Step 2 for the affected section(s). Civil Engineer revises the specific section(s) and re-submits to Step 5 for re-review.
   - **Major deficiencies** (multiple sections lack substantive rationale, cross-document conflicts with DEL-02-02, or fundamental misinterpretation of Addendum 03 requirements): Return to Step 2 for a comprehensive redraft. Re-execute Steps 3 and 4 (Addendum 03 integration and cross-check) before re-submitting to Step 5.
   - **Escalation:** If a deficiency cannot be resolved by the Civil Engineer alone (e.g., conflicting information between Addendum 03 and Appendix D, or missing input from DEL-02-02), escalate to the Proposal Manager / Design Coordinator for resolution before rework.
   - The brief **shall not proceed to Step 6** (integration into the Design Brief package) until all Step 5 checklist items pass.

**Verification (V-CDB-05):** All checklist items pass. Brief approved for integration.

### Step 6: Integrate into Design Brief Package

**Action:**
1. Combine the Civil Design Brief with the other four discipline briefs (Architectural, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT — DEL-03-01, DEL-03-03, DEL-03-04, DEL-03-05) and the accessibility/adaptability narrative (DEL-03-06) into the complete PKG-003 Design Brief package.
2. Confirm the package is presented in the order that matches RFP Section 7.1.2 sub-brief numbering: (1) Architectural, (2) Civil, (3) Structural, (4) Mechanical, (5) Electrical/IT.
3. Update the Proposal Compliance Matrix (DEL-01-01) to mark SOW-0011 (Design Brief — 5 sub-briefs) as complete once all five sub-briefs are finalized.

**Verification (V-CDB-06):** Civil brief is integrated into PKG-003 package; compliance matrix updated.
