# Specification — DEL-03-02: Civil Design Brief

## Scope

### Inclusions

This deliverable is the Civil Design Brief narrative required by RFP Section 7.1.2(2), authored by the Civil Engineer. It must address all seven topical areas listed in that section:

1. Parking design rationale (quantity, layout, accessible spaces, winter management, drainage)
2. Street access approach (Waskasoo Avenue North; emergency apparatus; public and pedestrian access)
3. Surface drainage design (parking, building perimeter, roof drainage; ponding prevention)
4. Stormwater management strategy (on-site retention/detention; storm pond relationship; environmental compliance)
5. Grading strategy (existing conditions baseline from Appendix E; cut/fill; slope stabilization; erosion control)
6. Utility connections (water, sanitary, storm, electrical, gas, telecom; tie-in approach)
7. Site servicing approach (cash allowance treatment per Addendum 03 §1.7; on-site vs. off-site scope split)

The brief explains the **rationale** behind civil/site decisions established in DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan); it does not replace concept drawings but provides the design thinking that supports them.

### Exclusions

- Concept drawings (produced in DEL-02-02; referenced here)
- Architectural site plan design rationale (DEL-03-01)
- Structural, mechanical, and electrical/IT design briefs (DEL-03-03, DEL-03-04, DEL-03-05)
- Accessibility and adaptability narrative (DEL-03-06)
- Sustainability and energy narrative for civil/site (PKG-004)
- Durability and maintenance narrative for civil/site elements (PKG-005)
- Detailed civil engineering calculations, design drawings, or specifications (post-award deliverables)
- Site servicing cost estimation (cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.7; pricing covered in DEL-01-06)

| **R-CDB-03** | The brief shall reference the 12-acre developable area and acknowledge that the remaining 8 acres are in the flood fringe (storm pond + dog park) and are not in the development scope. | Addendum 03 §1.2 | Site area figures confirmed in document |
| **R-CDB-04** | The brief shall state that site servicing tie-in costs are addressed via a cash allowance and are not included in the base proposal pricing. | Addendum 03 §1.7; C-12 | Statement present; consistent with DEL-01-06 |
| **R-CDB-05** | The brief shall not include the pickled sand storage building in any site layout or servicing rationale. | Addendum 03 §1.2; C-10 | Document review confirms no reference to pickled sand storage |
| **R-CDB-06** | The brief shall state that the geotechnical basis is the existing 2021 geotechnical investigation report (Appendix D); no additional geotechnical investigation is included at proposal stage. | DEC-013 | Explicit geotechnical basis statement present |
| **R-CDB-07** | The brief shall explain the parking design rationale: quantity, spatial arrangement (staff/visitor/apparatus separation), accessible parking, winter management, and surface drainage from parking areas. | RFP §7.1.2(2) | Parking rationale section present with substantive content |
| **R-CDB-08** | The brief shall describe the street access approach from Waskasoo Avenue North, addressing emergency apparatus circulation, public vehicle access, pedestrian routes, and any required coordination with the Town road authority. | RFP §7.1.2(2); Decomposition DEL-02-02 | Access approach section present with apparatus movement addressed |
| **R-CDB-09** | The brief shall describe the stormwater management strategy including the relationship between the 12-acre developable area and the 8-acre storm pond/flood fringe zone, and how this affects the stormwater discharge approach. | RFP §7.1.2(2); Addendum 03 §1.2 | Stormwater section addresses storm pond relationship |
| **R-CDB-10** | The brief shall address the grading strategy by referencing Site Grading (Appendix E) as the existing-conditions baseline and describing the proposed cut/fill approach, slope stabilization, and erosion control measures. | RFP §7.1.2(2); Decomposition §2 | Grading section references Appendix E and describes approach |
| **R-CDB-11** | The brief shall identify how apparatus bay and PW bay sumps are integrated into the site drainage approach (sump drainage routing to sanitary or site drainage system). | Addendum 03 (decomposition §4 — bay sumps required) | Bay sump drainage addressed in drainage or utility section |
| **R-CDB-12** | The brief shall note that survey files will be provided to the award winner by the civil engineering firm after contract award, and any site design assumptions made at proposal stage shall be stated. | Addendum 03; SOW-0026 | Survey timing statement present; proposal-stage assumptions stated |
| **R-CDB-13** | The brief shall provide rationale for the Cold Storage building (60 ft × 100 ft) siting as part of the overall site layout explanation (relationship to apparatus circulation, drainage, and utility routing). | Decomposition DEL-02-02 | Cold Storage siting rationale addressed |
| **R-CDB-14** | The brief shall be cross-consistent with DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan) in terminology, site area figures, and site arrangement. | _REFERENCES.md; Decomposition §9 | Cross-document consistency check: no conflicts found |

| **R-CDB-16** | Each topical section of the brief shall provide substantive professional rationale -- not merely state that a topic will be addressed, but explain *why* the design decision was made and how it responds to site conditions, operational requirements, or regulatory constraints. A substantive rationale must: (a) explain the reasoning behind the decision, (b) reference at least one site condition or operational driver, and (c) connect to the specific need it serves. | OBJ-004 (evaluator expectation for "substantive professional reasoning"); Guidance Purpose section | Review each section for substantive rationale per the three-part test; sections with only statements of intent without reasoning do not pass. **ASSUMPTION: this criterion operationalizes the evaluator expectation stated in Guidance; the specific three-part test is a proposal for human confirmation.** (Enrichment: A-003, D-002, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md) |

**ASSUMPTION (R-CDB-11):** The bay sump drainage integration is listed as a civil brief requirement based on Addendum 03 stating bay sumps are required in all bays. The civil brief is the appropriate place to explain site-level drainage routing for sump discharge. However, the exact system (sanitary, grey water, or perimeter drain) may be a mechanical/plumbing decision; the civil brief need only address the site drainage routing aspect.
