# Guidance — DEL-03-02: Civil Design Brief

## Purpose

The Civil Design Brief demonstrates that the Design-Builder has a credible, site-responsive civil engineering strategy for the Penhold Public Services Building. It articulates the *rationale* behind the civil and site design decisions shown in DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan), covering the seven topics required by RFP Section 7.1.2(2): parking, street access, surface drainage, stormwater management, grading, utility connections, and site servicing.

The brief contributes to OBJ-004 (Design Brief, 5 pts). Evaluators expect substantive professional reasoning — not just statements of intent, but explanations of *why* each civil decision was made and how it responds to site conditions and operational requirements.

## Principles

| ID | Principle | Description | Implication for the Brief |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P-CDB-01** | Operational Fit | Civil site design must support Fire and Public Works operations effectively and safely, not generic commercial development. | Explain how parking separation, apparatus access lanes, and utility routing serve the specific operational demands of a combined fire hall and public works facility. |
| **P-CDB-02** | Site Responsiveness | Civil decisions must be grounded in actual site conditions, not generic assumptions. | Reference geotechnical (bearing, groundwater), wetland (setbacks), environmental (Ghostpine), flood zone (8-acre fringe), and grading (Appendix E) reports. Show how each condition influenced design. |
| **P-CDB-03** | Alberta Climate Resilience | Surface drainage, stormwater, and grading must accommodate prairie climate: spring melt volumes, summer thunderstorms, hard freeze-thaw cycles, and persistent snow accumulation. | Describe drainage strategy for spring melt; identify snow storage areas; confirm drainage structures are designed for freeze-thaw. |
| **P-CDB-04** | Regulatory and Environmental Compliance | Site design must meet applicable codes (ABC, NBCC), Town development standards, and environmental regulations — including wetland protection and flood zone constraints. **Note on ABC/NBCC relationship:** Alberta Building Code (ABC) adopts the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) with Alberta-specific amendments. For civil/site design elements (parking minimums, accessible parking, site grading), **ABC is the governing code** as the provincial adoption; NBCC is the referenced national standard from which ABC derives. The brief should cite ABC as the governing authority; references to NBCC are appropriate only when a specific NBCC provision applies that has not been amended by ABC. **ASSUMPTION: this hierarchy is standard practice in Alberta; Civil Engineer / Proposal Manager to confirm if the RFP requires a different citation approach.** (Enrichment: A-002, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md) | Acknowledge applicable standards; demonstrate wetland setback awareness; confirm stormwater discharge is environmentally compliant. Cite ABC (not NBCC) as the governing code for site design elements unless a specific unamended NBCC provision applies. |
| **P-CDB-05** | Cost Optimization | Civil design should minimize unnecessary site work while achieving drainage, access, and utility objectives. | Explain grading strategy in terms of cut/fill balance; explain utility routing efficiency. Avoid importing excessive fill or over-engineering stormwater systems. |
| **P-CDB-06** | Cash Allowance Transparency | Addendum 03 §1.7 permits site servicing tie-in costs to be handled via cash allowance, not priced in the base proposal. This must be clearly communicated in the brief. | State explicitly that base proposal scope covers on-site utility distribution and site civil works; off-site tie-in engineering, permitting, and installation are in the cash allowance. |
| **P-CDB-07** | Cross-Discipline Coordination | Civil design integrates with structural (foundation drainage, grading), mechanical (sump drainage routing, utility service points), and electrical (service entry, generator location) disciplines. | Brief should identify key coordination points without duplicating content from sibling design briefs. |

## Considerations

### C-CDB-01: Parking Design Rationale

The brief must explain parking as an integrated site element, not a residual rectangle.

**Key questions to address:**
- How many spaces are proposed and what drives the quantity? (ASSUMPTION: RFP does not specify a parking count; the brief should state the proposed count and justify it based on staffing levels, Fire OSR requirements, and standard municipal practice — specific count is TBD pending design team determination.)
- Where is parking located relative to the building and why? (Consider: apparatus access must not be blocked by visitor parking; solar roof orientation for south/southwest exposure may influence building orientation and therefore parking location relative to building.)
- How many accessible spaces, and where? (Alberta Building Code minimum — location TBD; confirm at permit stage.)
- How is winter parking managed? (Snow storage areas, plowing lanes, surface treatment — critical for Alberta climate.)
- How does parking drain? (Catch basins, swales, slope direction — prevent ponding and prevent contaminated melt runoff from reaching wetlands or storm pond untreated.)

**Source basis:** RFP §7.1.2(2) (topic), Addendum 03 §1.2 (12-acre site), Appendix D (geotechnical/wetland), Appendix E (grading).

---

### C-CDB-02: Street Access Approach

The access approach must reflect the operational reality of a fire hall and public works facility.

**Key questions to address:**
- Emergency apparatus access: dedicated lane from Waskasoo Avenue North? Width and turning radius adequate for the largest apparatus? Staging areas on-site for multiple simultaneous responses?
- Public and visitor access: separate from apparatus circulation to prevent conflicts during emergency response?
- Pedestrian access: accessible walkway from parking to building entry; level, no steps; winter maintenance possible.
- Service/delivery access: public works facilities receive regular deliveries (fuel, equipment, materials); brief should acknowledge this operational need.
- Road authority coordination: any access permits required for new curb cuts or turning lanes on Waskasoo Avenue North? (ASSUMPTION: Alberta Transportation or Town road authority access permit required — confirm with Town.)
- Sight distances: confirm adequate sight lines for vehicles exiting the site onto Waskasoo Avenue North at design speed.

**Source basis:** RFP §7.1.2(2), Decomposition DEL-02-02, Addendum 03.

---

### C-CDB-03: Surface Drainage Design

Surface drainage must prevent ponding and protect site operations year-round.

**Key questions to address:**
- Parking lot drainage: catch basins at low points; swales directing flow toward storm system or on-site detention; prevent oil/sediment from parking surfaces entering stormwater uncontrolled.
- Building perimeter drainage: grading sloped away from building on all sides; perimeter interceptor drains at foundation if geotechnical conditions indicate groundwater risk.
- Roof drainage: downspout routing to site storm system; avoid discharge against foundation or across pedestrian paths.
- Low points: confirm design eliminates standing water (operational and safety risk in freeze-thaw climate).
- Seasonal drainage: drainage infrastructure must function in freeze-thaw cycles (insulated pipes, heated catch basins if necessary — ASSUMPTION, confirm with detailed design).
- Bay sump drainage routing: apparatus bay and PW bay sumps (per Addendum 03) require drainage from slab level; brief should address how sump discharge routes through the site drainage system (e.g., connection to sanitary sewer at suitable point or grey water system — coordination with mechanical/plumbing design required).

**Source basis:** RFP §7.1.2(2), Addendum 03 (bay sumps), Appendix D (geotechnical/wetland), Appendix E (grading).

---

### C-CDB-04: Stormwater Management Strategy

The 8-acre flood fringe / storm pond area creates both a constraint and a potential opportunity.

**Key questions to address:**
- Does the site design discharge stormwater to the Town storm main, directly to the on-site storm pond, or a combination? (ASSUMPTION: Cash allowance for tie-ins implies Town main connection is anticipated; the storm pond on the flood fringe may provide passive attenuation but is not necessarily the designed receiving point — confirm with detailed design.)
- Volume and rate control: is on-site detention required before discharge, or does Town infrastructure accept direct discharge? (TBD — depends on Town stormwater bylaw and capacity of existing mains.)
- Water quality: parking lot runoff may contain oils, sediment, and de-icing chemicals; brief should address whether any oil/water separation or sediment settling is included in the on-site design.
- Environmental compliance: stormwater design must protect wetlands (Appendix D) and respect flood zone boundaries (8-acre flood fringe must not receive additional fill or development).
- Cash allowance context: off-site storm main tie-in engineering and permitting are in the cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.7; the brief should be clear that on-site stormwater infrastructure is in the base scope.

**Source basis:** RFP §7.1.2(2), Addendum 03 §1.2 and §1.7, Appendix D (wetland/environmental), flood zone mapping.

---

### C-CDB-05: Grading Strategy

Grading must balance construction cost efficiency with functional drainage and site access outcomes.

**Key questions to address:**
- What do the existing site grades look like? (Appendix E — Site Grading provides this baseline; brief must reference it.)
- Is the 12-acre developable area relatively flat? Are there significant slopes? (ASSUMPTION: Based on prairie context, site is likely relatively level, but Appendix E is the authoritative reference — specific elevations TBD.)
- Cut/fill strategy: is earthwork balanced on-site, or is material imported/exported? (Balancing reduces cost and trucking; brief should state the approach.)
- Slope stabilization: if slopes exceed stable angles, what approach is proposed? (Vegetation, geotextiles, retaining structures — proportional to scale of grading required.)
- Erosion control during construction: silt fences, erosion blankets, temporary seeding as required by Alberta Environment.
- Grading relationship to foundations: brief should confirm that site grading supports positive drainage away from the building perimeter and accommodates the building's slab-on-grade and foundation design (ASSUMPTION: concrete slab-on-grade in apparatus bays; coordinate with Structural Engineer).
- Flood fringe boundary: confirm that grading design respects the 12-acre/8-acre boundary; no filling in the flood fringe zone.

**Source basis:** RFP §7.1.2(2), Appendix D (geotechnical), Appendix E (grading), Addendum 03 §1.2.

---

### C-CDB-06: Utility Connections

Utility connections must serve the building's specific operational demands.

**Key questions to address:**
- Water: Town water main location and assumed size (ASSUMPTION: adequate capacity available on Waskasoo Avenue North — confirm with Town at detailed design); branch service to building sized for fire suppression demand plus domestic use plus fill stations.
- Sanitary sewer: Town sanitary main location; gravity or pumped system (depends on invert elevations relative to building floor — TBD pending survey and detailed design); sump discharge connection.
- Storm sewer: Town storm main location; tie-in elevation; assumed capacity for site discharge rate.
- Electrical: utility electrical service entry point; overhead or underground (ASSUMPTION: underground preferred for reliability and aesthetics — confirm with utility provider); transformer location on-site; service ampacity for building loads plus generator tie-in.
- Gas: natural gas availability on Waskasoo Avenue North (ASSUMPTION: available — confirm with ATCO); service sizing for heating plant and any other gas-fired equipment.
- Telecommunications: broadband/fiber availability; Town may have requirements for public services building connectivity.
- Routing on-site: utilities must be routed without conflict with the structural grid, mechanical rooms, and equipment zones; brief may note coordination with DEL-02-04 (Mechanical Concept) for service point locations.
- Fill station utilities: 2-inch water fill stations in fire apparatus bay and PW bay require dedicated water supply runs from the main service; brief should acknowledge this in the utility distribution description.

**Source basis:** RFP §7.1.2(2), Addendum 03 (fill stations, bay sumps, generator).

---

### C-CDB-07: Site Servicing Approach

This section must clearly communicate the cash allowance basis established by Addendum 03 §1.7.

**Key message to convey:**
- Base proposal scope (in pricing): on-site utility distribution (from building to proposed tie-in points), on-site site civil works (grading, drainage, paving, landscaping).
- Cash allowance scope (not in base pricing): off-site main extensions, utility relocations if needed, access permitting, off-site engineering and permitting.
- Survey timing: survey files are provided after contract award; detailed tie-in design will follow award, with costs managed within the allowance.
- Post-award adjustment mechanism: if survey reveals utility conflicts or main locations differ from assumptions, the cash allowance framework accommodates cost adjustment without affecting base contract price.

**Why this matters:** Evaluators and the Owner need to understand that the proponent has correctly interpreted Addendum 03 §1.7 and is not double-counting site servicing costs or leaving them uncovered.

**Source basis:** Addendum 03 §1.7; C-12; Decomposition SOW-0026; DEC-013.

## Trade-offs

| ID | Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Evaluation Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T-CDB-01** | Parking location relative to apparatus access | Parking on north side (apparatus access from south, separate) | Parking on south side (apparatus access from north, separate) | Either can work; the key is clear separation; brief should explain the chosen arrangement and why it supports emergency response |
| **T-CDB-02** | Stormwater management approach | Full on-site detention pond (larger footprint, higher capital cost; independent of Town main capacity) | On-site quality treatment + controlled discharge to Town storm main (smaller footprint, lower capital; depends on Town system capacity) | ASSUMPTION: Option B is typical for a site of this scale in a municipal context; Option A may be required by Town bylaw — confirm with Town |
| **T-CDB-03** | Grading magnitude | Balanced cut/fill (cost-neutral earthwork; may accept some grading variation) | Import fill to optimize site levels (higher cost; improves drainage geometry) | Brief should state which approach is chosen based on Appendix E conditions |
| **T-CDB-04** | Utility service routing | Direct but longer routing to Waskasoo Avenue North mains | Optimized routing via site circulation corridors | Driven by depth of Town mains and site topography; brief should acknowledge the approach taken |
| **T-CDB-05** | Bay sump discharge | Route to sanitary sewer (standard for wash water with oil/silt) | Route to separate grey water or treatment system | ASSUMPTION: sanitary sewer connection is standard practice for apparatus bay wash water; confirm with local regulatory requirements |

## Examples

**Note: All examples below are illustrative of appropriate content style and level of detail. They are not sourced from confirmed design decisions, which remain TBD pending the Design-Builder's actual design. Label: ASSUMPTION — content is illustrative.**

**EX-CDB-01: Strong parking rationale (example excerpt)**

"Parking is organized on the east side of the site, accessed from a single curb cut on Waskasoo Avenue North, maintaining the western and northern frontage clear for apparatus bay approach and exit. The layout provides [XX] stalls including [Y] accessible spaces adjacent to the main public entry, conforming to Alberta Building Code minimum requirements. Snow storage is designated at the northeast corner, within the 12-acre development area and clear of apparatus access lanes. Surface drainage in the parking area is managed via catch basins at low points, with flow directed to a sediment swale along the east property boundary before tie-in to the Town storm main."

**EX-CDB-02: Clear site servicing statement (example excerpt)**

"Site servicing tie-in costs — including engineering and construction of connections from Town water, sanitary, and storm mains to the site — are carried in a cash allowance per Addendum 03 §1.7 and are not included in the base proposal price. The base scope includes on-site utility distribution from the building to the proposed tie-in points, as shown on the Site Concept Plan (DEL-02-02). Detailed tie-in design and cost refinement will occur post-award once the Town provides survey files."

**EX-CDB-03: Weak parking rationale (avoid this style)**

"Parking will be provided on-site as required by code." — This provides no rationale, no quantity, no location, no operational reasoning. Evaluators will score this poorly.

## Defining "Substantive" Rationale

*(Enrichment: D-002, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md)*

Specification verification criteria and this Guidance document both refer to "substantive professional reasoning" and "substantive rationale." To operationalize this term for the Civil Engineer and reviewers, a **substantive rationale** is one that meets all three of the following criteria:

1. **Explains the why:** States the reasoning behind the design decision, not merely that a decision was made or a topic will be addressed.
2. **References at least one site condition or operational driver:** Connects to a factual condition (geotechnical, flood zone, wetland, climate, operational workflow, apparatus access need, etc.) rather than relying solely on general code compliance.
3. **Connects to the specific need it serves:** Explains how the decision addresses the identified condition or driver, completing the rationale chain from condition to decision to outcome.

**Threshold test:** A section that contains only a statement of intent (e.g., "Surface drainage will be designed to prevent ponding") is **not substantive**. A section that explains why the approach was chosen given the site's conditions and operational context **is substantive**, even if detailed engineering data is TBD pending design development.

**ASSUMPTION: This three-part test is proposed for human confirmation as the operational definition of "substantive" under OBJ-004 evaluator expectations. The Proposal Manager should confirm this aligns with the RFP evaluation rubric.**

---

## Rationale for Page-Length Targets in Procedure

*(Enrichment: C-002, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md)*

Procedure Step 2 includes target page lengths for each topical section (e.g., 0.5-1 page for parking, 0.75-1.5 pages for access). These targets are **advisory guidelines, not Specification requirements.** They are included in Procedure to help the Civil Engineer calibrate the level of detail appropriate for a proposal-stage design brief, not a detailed engineering report.

**Rationale:** The Design Brief (PKG-003) contributes to OBJ-004 (5 pts). Evaluators expect sufficient depth to demonstrate understanding but will evaluate a complete proposal PDF under the 15 MB constraint (C-01). Overly long briefs risk consuming PDF space better used for drawings and other scored content. Overly short briefs risk appearing superficial.

The Civil Engineer should calibrate to content depth needed -- if a topic requires more space to provide substantive rationale (per the definition above), exceed the target. If a topic can be addressed substantively in less space, use less. **The page targets do not override the requirement for substantive rationale in R-CDB-16.**

---

## Rationale for Erosion Control Scope Treatment

*(Enrichment: E-001, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md)*

Guidance C-CDB-05 mentions "Erosion control during construction: silt fences, erosion blankets, temporary seeding per Alberta Environment requirements" and Procedure Step 2.5 directs the Civil Engineer to "Address erosion control during construction." However, there is **no corresponding Specification requirement (R-CDB-xx) for erosion control.**

**Rationale for omission:** Erosion and sediment control during construction is a **construction-phase activity** addressed in the Construction Methodology narrative (PKG-007, DEL-07-01). The Civil Design Brief is a **design rationale** document, not a construction execution plan. Including erosion control in Guidance and Procedure acknowledges that the Civil Engineer should consider it as part of the grading strategy, but does not mandate it as a scoreable design brief topic under RFP §7.1.2(2), which lists seven specific topics -- none of which explicitly require a construction-phase erosion control plan.

**However:** If the Civil Engineer determines that erosion control rationale strengthens the brief's demonstration of site responsiveness (P-CDB-02) or climate resilience (P-CDB-03), including it is appropriate. It is optional guidance, not a requirement gap.

**ASSUMPTION: This interpretation may need human confirmation. If the proposal team determines that erosion control should be a requirement, add R-CDB-17 to Specification and a corresponding verification row.**

---

## Landscaping Scope Clarification

*(Enrichment: E-002, _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md)*

Procedure Step 2.7 (Site Servicing Approach) lists "landscaping" as part of the base scope definition ("on-site utility distribution, site grading, drainage infrastructure, paving, and landscaping"). However, landscaping is **not mentioned in any Specification requirement, Guidance consideration, or Datasheet construction topic.**

**Clarification:** Landscaping is referenced in Procedure only in the context of defining what is in the "base scope" vs. the "cash allowance scope" for site servicing. It is not a required topic for the Civil Design Brief under RFP §7.1.2(2). If the Civil Engineer addresses landscaping, it would be in the Site Servicing Approach section (2.7) as part of explaining the base scope definition -- not as a standalone brief topic requiring its own rationale.

**ASSUMPTION: The Civil Engineer is not expected to provide a landscaping design rationale in the Civil Design Brief. The term appears in Procedure's scope definition for completeness. If the proposal team determines that landscaping rationale should be developed, it should be identified as a separate task, potentially under the Architectural Design Brief (DEL-03-01) or as a cross-cutting topic. Civil Engineer / Proposal Manager to confirm.**
