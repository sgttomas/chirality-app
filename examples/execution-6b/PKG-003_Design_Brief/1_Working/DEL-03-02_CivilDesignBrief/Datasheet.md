| **Anticipated parking count range** | TBD pending design team determination. Basis for quantity: staffing levels, shift overlap, visitor demand, and ABC code minimum ratios. **ASSUMPTION: RFP does not specify a parking count; the brief author should record at least the formula inputs or an estimated range.** | Guidance C-CDB-01 (key question); RFP §7.1.2(2) |
| **Brief relationship to concept** | Civil Design Brief explains rationale behind civil decisions shown in DEL-02-02 (Civil Site Concept Plan) | _REFERENCES.md; Decomposition §9 DEL-03-02 |
