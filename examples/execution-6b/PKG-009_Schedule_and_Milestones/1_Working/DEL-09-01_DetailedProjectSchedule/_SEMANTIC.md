# Deliverable: DEL-09-01 Detailed Project Schedule

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** The Detailed Project Schedule exists to demonstrate that a feasible, cost-optimized project timeline can be committed to contractually, grounding all phase durations in transparent assumptions and critical-path logic. It must carry the knowledge of how design, permitting, construction, commissioning, and closeout activities interrelate temporally, so that evaluators and the Owner can trust the proposed sequence as both realistic and value-maximizing.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Matrix D — Objectives (3x4)

### Construction: Addition A + resolution-transformed F

`L_D(i,j) = A(i,j) + ("resolution" * F(i,j))`

For each cell, compute `"resolution" * F(i,j)`, then form the two-element collection with `A(i,j)`, then interpret.

---

#### Cell D(normative, guiding)

- A(normative,guiding) = "prescriptive direction"
- F(normative,necessity) = "binding compliance standard" (NOTE: D columns are {guiding,applying,judging,reviewing}; F columns are {necessity,sufficiency,completeness,consistency}. The mapping is: guiding->necessity, applying->sufficiency, judging->completeness, reviewing->consistency.)

Wait -- D is 3x4 with columns {guiding, applying, judging, reviewing} same as A. F is 3x4 with columns {necessity, sufficiency, completeness, consistency}. The formula is `L_D(i,j) = A(i,j) + ("resolution" * F(i,j))`.

Since D and F share the same row labels but different column labels, and D shares column labels with A, the index j in D maps to the same j in both A and F. That means: D(i, guiding) uses A(i, guiding) and F(i, guiding)... but F does not have a "guiding" column.

Re-reading the STRUCTURE: D is 3x4 with columns `[guiding, applying, judging, reviewing]` and rows `[normative, operative, evaluative]`. F is 3x4 with columns `[necessity, sufficiency, completeness, consistency]`. The formula uses `F(i,j)` with the same index j. Since D has 4 columns and F has 4 columns, j ranges 1..4 and the mapping is positional: j=1: guiding/necessity, j=2: applying/sufficiency, j=3: judging/completeness, j=4: reviewing/consistency.

So: `L_D(i,j) = A(i, col_A_j) + ("resolution" * F(i, col_F_j))` where j is positional.
