# Guidance: Detailed Project Schedule (DEL-09-01)

## Purpose

**Why this deliverable exists:**

The Detailed Project Schedule is a separately evaluated sub-criterion under the Project Delivery Plan (2 out of 10 points, per Decomposition §15 Evaluation Criteria Crosswalk). The schedule demonstrates that the Proponent has:

1. Thought through the phasing and sequencing of design, permitting, construction, and closeout activities specific to this project.
2. Identified the critical path and understood project logic, dependencies, and risk.
3. Proposed realistic timelines for permit approvals, design reviews, construction duration, commissioning, and closeout.
4. Leveraged the Owner's explicit "not schedule-driven" philosophy (RFP 2.2, p. 8) to propose a cost-optimized approach.

A credible, realistic schedule with transparent assumptions builds evaluator confidence and demonstrates PM maturity. Because the accepted schedule forms part of the Contract (RFP 7.1.9, p. 19), a defensible, well-documented schedule also protects the Proponent post-award.

## Principles

### P-001: Design-Build Schedule Logic (Design-Construct Overlap)

In a Design-Build delivery, design and construction can overlap. The schedule should reflect this DB advantage: phased design allows early construction start (e.g., foundation/site work) while later design phases are still underway. This reduces total project duration and can reduce costs compared to a sequential design-then-build approach.

**Caveat:** Overlap requires mature design in the "build-ahead" scope before construction begins in that area. The schedule must clearly show the design-to-construction interface for each phase.

**Source:** CCDC 14-2013 Design-Build contract form; Decomposition §1 (Design-Build delivery method, CCDC 14-2013 with Appendix J).

### P-002: Cost Optimization over Schedule Compression

The RFP explicitly states the Owner is "NOT schedule-driven" and "Proponents are strongly encouraged to leverage the Owner's schedule flexibility to the extent it reduces capital costs or increases value" (RFP 2.2, p. 8). The schedule should therefore prioritize cost/value optimization over minimum-duration completion. This may mean:
- Scheduling outdoor site/foundation work during optimal weather windows (spring-summer) to reduce weather-related delays and premium costs.
- Sequencing procurement of long-lead equipment early (e.g., overhead doors, generator) to avoid expediting costs.
- Staging construction to minimize peak resource loads and reduce general conditions overhead.

**Source:** RFP 2.2, p. 8; Decomposition §1 (Schedule philosophy: "NOT schedule-driven; proponents may optimize for cost/value").

### P-003: Critical Path Transparency

The critical path (the longest sequence of dependent activities, determining minimum project completion) must be explicitly identified and narrated. This demonstrates PM discipline and allows the evaluator and Owner to understand where schedule risk resides and what float (if any) exists on non-critical activities.

**Source:** RFP 7.1.9, p. 19 ("Critical Path should also be identified in the Gantt Chart").

### P-004: Realistic, Assumption-Backed Durations (Contractual Weight)

All activity durations must be defensible and grounded in explicit assumptions. Because the accepted schedule forms part of the Contract (RFP 7.1.9, p. 19), **all proposed durations carry contractual weight and should be treated as binding commitments, not aspirational targets.** This means that once the schedule is agreed upon, the Design-Builder is contractually bound to the proposed milestone dates and durations. Overly optimistic durations create post-award contractual risk; overly conservative durations may undermine the cost-optimization objective (P-002) and evaluator confidence (OBJ-009). Key assumption categories:
- Permit submission and AHJ approval timelines (jurisdiction-specific; Penhold AHJ timeline TBD)
- Owner design review and approval cycles (typically 2-3 weeks per submission)
- Weather and seasonal impacts (Alberta climate; peak outdoor construction: April-October)
- Procurement lead times for specialty items (overhead doors, backup generator)
- Commissioning and training duration

**Source:** RFP 7.1.9 (schedule "forms part of the Contract"); Decomposition DEL-09-01 ("schedule assumptions stated"); Datasheet.md Identification (Contract Status). (Enriched per _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md D-001)

### P-005: Integration with Related Deliverables

The Detailed Project Schedule is not produced in isolation. It must integrate milestone dates from DEL-06-02 (Design Docs Plan), reflect construction methodology from DEL-07-01, align commissioning milestones with DEL-08-01, and incorporate site constraint assumptions from DEL-10-02. Inconsistency between these deliverables will undermine proposal credibility.

### P-006: Post-Award Continuity

The proposal schedule is also the starting point for the post-award baseline schedule, which the Design-Builder must submit within 20 calendar days of contract award (RFP 7.2, p. 19). Monthly updates are then required. A well-structured Gantt with an editable source file (e.g., MS Project, Smartsheet) reduces post-award schedule administration effort.

## Considerations

### C-001: Work Breakdown Structure

Before building the Gantt, organize activities into logical phases:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | Kickoff and mobilization (contract execution, team assembly, site data review) |
| Phase 1 | Design Development (BDD through 100% IFC per RFP 7.1.8) |
| Phase 2 | Permitting (AHJ building permit submission and approval) |
| Phase 3 | Pre-Construction (shop drawings, long-lead procurement, contractor mobilization) |
| Phase 4 | Site Work and Foundation (grading, drainage, foundation, underground utilities) |
| Phase 5 | Building Construction -- Main Building (structure, envelope, MEP rough-in, finishes) |
| Phase 6 | Building Construction -- Cold Storage (structure, envelope, finishes; may parallel Phase 5) |
| Phase 7 | Systems Commissioning (HVAC, fire protection, electrical, generator, apparatus bay exhaust checkout) |
| Phase 8 | Closeout and Handover (final inspections, training, O&M manuals, occupancy permit, substantial performance) |
| Phase 9 | Warranty Period (12 months post-occupancy permit, per RFP 7.6). **Gantt representation note:** At proposal stage, Phase 9 should be represented as a single summary bar spanning 52 weeks with the 12-Month Warranty Review as the closing milestone. Detailed sub-activities (monitoring, deficiency calls, 12-month review meeting) are listed in the Procedure Step 2 WBS for internal planning but do not require individual Gantt bars in the proposal submission; the summary bar and closing milestone are sufficient to demonstrate awareness of the warranty obligation.

### C-002: Design Submission Milestone Integration

Per RFP 7.1.8 (p. 18), the five design submission milestones to integrate are:

| Milestone | Typical Timing Relative to Design Start |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Building Design Development (BDD) | Early design phase (first Owner review gate) |
| 60% Detailed Design review | Mid-design phase; typically when permit submission begins |
| Foundation Issued for Construction (IFC) (if needed) | Triggered by phased DB start on foundation; may overlap with 60% DD |
| 100% Building Detail Design | Late design; near-final design before full IFC |
| 100% IFC Detailed Design Package | Final design release; full construction can proceed |

Each milestone should show: (a) the submission date, (b) a 2-3 week Owner review window, and (c) a feedback incorporation window before the next design phase begins.

**Source:** RFP 7.1.8, p. 18; Decomposition DEL-06-02.

### C-003: Site Constraint Scheduling Implications

The reference reports in Appendix D-F (Decomposition §2) may affect schedule timing:
- **Geotechnical (2021 report):** If soil conditions require engineered fill, dewatering, or deep foundation systems, add duration to Phase 4 (Site Work and Foundation). No additional investigation is required per DEC-013 (Decomposition).
- **Wetland Assessment:** Wetland buffers or mitigation requirements may constrain site work timing (e.g., seasonal wetland disturbance restrictions). ASSUMPTION: wetland impacts are manageable within standard environmental permit conditions; actual schedule impact TBD.
- **Flood Zone:** 8 acres of the 20-acre parcel are in the flood fringe; the 12-acre developable area is the active site (Addendum 03 §1.1). ASSUMPTION: the 12-acre developable area is not materially affected by flood fringe during construction; drainage design and grading per Appendix E.
- **Existing Site Grading (Appendix E):** Grading was completed by the Owner. ASSUMPTION: existing grading reduces major earthworks requirements; minor site grading re-work TBD.

### C-004: Long-Lead Procurement

To avoid construction delays, identify and order long-lead items during the design phase:
- Fire apparatus bay overhead doors (16 ft minimum height per Addendum 03 §1.4): ASSUMPTION 8-12 weeks manufacturing lead time.
- Backup diesel generator (minimum loads: kitchen, ICP/meeting room, 2 bathrooms, bay door secondary opening per Addendum 03 §1.15): ASSUMPTION 6-10 weeks lead time.
- Solar-capable roofing (orientation: flat, south, west, or southwest per Addendum 03 §1.10): ASSUMPTION standard lead times apply; TBD if specialty roofing system required.

Early procurement (during 60% DD phase) de-risks the construction critical path.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.4, §1.10, §1.15; Decomposition DEL-02-04, DEL-02-05.

### C-006: Resource Leveling Strategy

When developing the schedule, consider resource leveling as a distinct scheduling concern alongside duration estimation and phasing. Resource leveling addresses:

- **Peak crew size management:** Avoid scheduling multiple high-labor-intensity phases (e.g., Main Building MEP rough-in and Cold Storage construction) to overlap at maximum demand, which can cause subcontractor availability issues and premium pricing.
- **Trade stacking risks:** Concurrent trades in confined areas (e.g., MEP rough-in, interior framing, fire protection) require sequencing to prevent productivity loss from interference.
- **Cost optimization link:** Resource leveling directly supports cost optimization (P-002) by smoothing labor demand curves, reducing overtime premiums, and minimizing idle crew time between phases.

ASSUMPTION: Resource leveling is a standard scheduling practice for Design-Build projects of this scale; the specific approach should be determined by the Scheduler based on team availability and subcontractor commitments. (Source: Guidance P-002; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md B-004)

### C-005: Weather and Seasonal Planning

Alberta climate creates seasonal constraints on outdoor construction activities:
- **Favorable outdoor construction:** April through October (approximate)
- **Challenging/costly winter outdoor work:** November through March (concrete curing, excavation, ground freeze)
- **Indoor construction (MEP, finishes):** Can proceed year-round once building is enclosed

The schedule should show outdoor site work (grading, foundation, underground utilities, structural steel) during favorable seasons where possible. This is the primary mechanism for seasonal cost optimization under the Owner's "not schedule-driven" philosophy.

ASSUMPTION: Weather contingency is included in duration estimates. Actual weather risk is Proponent's responsibility per standard CCDC 14-2013 risk allocation.

## Trade-offs

### T-001: Schedule Duration vs. Resource Cost

| Option | Characteristic |
|--------|---------------|
| Longer schedule (18-24 months) | Lower peak resource intensity; reduced overhead per week; less schedule risk; higher total GC overhead duration |
| Shorter schedule (12-15 months) | Higher peak resource intensity; more concurrent trades; higher short-term cost; lower total GC overhead duration |
| Cost-optimized schedule | Matches resource ramp to seasonal opportunity; avoids peak premium pricing; leverages Owner's schedule flexibility |

The Owner's "not schedule-driven" direction favors the cost-optimized approach: schedule duration should be driven by cost efficiency, not maximum speed.

**Source:** RFP 2.2, p. 8.

### T-002: Design Completeness vs. Early Construction Start

| Option | Characteristic |
|--------|---------------|
| Full design before construction (sequential) | Lower construction risk; higher design-phase resource intensity; no DB overlap benefit |
| Phased design/build overlap | Lower overall duration; allows construction to begin on foundation/site before full design; requires careful design-build interface management |

ASSUMPTION: Phased design/build overlap is standard CCDC 14 DB practice and is appropriate for this project. The schedule should clearly show which construction activities can proceed before full design completion.

### T-003: Single-Phase vs. Phased Construction (Main + Cold Storage)

| Option | Characteristic |
|--------|---------------|
| Sequential (Main Building first, then Cold Storage) | Simpler logistics; lower peak resource demand; longer total duration |
| Parallel (Main Building and Cold Storage simultaneously) | Shorter total duration; higher peak resource demand; may improve value if critical path is construction duration |
| Cold Storage first | Shorter risk item completed first; crew can mobilize and then scale up for Main Building |

The preferred approach should be stated in the schedule with cost rationale. ASSUMPTION: parallel construction is feasible given site size (12 acres); resource conflict is manageable.

### T-004: Permit Strategy (Concurrent vs. Sequential Design and Permit)

| Option | Characteristic |
|--------|---------------|
| Sequential: Full design, then permit | Lowest permit revision risk; highest total duration |
| Concurrent: Submit at 60% DD, continue design during review | Standard DB practice; reduces total duration; risk of minor permit revisions |
| Phased permits (foundation IFC first) | Enables early foundation start; standard for DB; requires permit authority familiarity with phased permitting |

ASSUMPTION: Concurrent permitting (submission at 60% DD) is feasible with the Penhold AHJ and is the approach reflected in the schedule.

## Examples

### EX-001: Illustrative Phase Structure (Proposal-Level Gantt)

The following illustrates a plausible phase structure. Actual durations are TBD by the Scheduler and must be grounded in project-specific assumptions.

```
Phase 0: Kickoff & Mobilization         Weeks 1-4
Phase 1: Design Development             Weeks 1-24
  - BDD Submission + Owner Review       Week 6-9
  - 60% DD Submission + Owner Review    Week 13-16
  - Foundation IFC Submission + Review  Week 14-17
  - 100% BDD Submission + Owner Review  Week 20-23
  - 100% IFC Package Complete           Week 24
Phase 2: Permitting (concurrent)        Weeks 13-21
  - Permit Submission (at 60% DD)       Week 13
  - AHJ Review                         Weeks 13-20
  - Permit Issued                       Week 21
Phase 3: Pre-Construction               Weeks 18-24
  - Long-lead procurement (doors/gen)   Weeks 15-25
  - Contractor mobilization             Week 22
Phase 4: Site Work & Foundation         Weeks 22-32
Phase 5: Main Building Construction     Weeks 28-65
Phase 6: Cold Storage                   Weeks 28-44 (parallel)
Phase 7: Commissioning                  Weeks 63-70
Phase 8: Closeout & Handover            Weeks 70-75
  - Substantial Performance             Week 72
  - Occupancy Permit                    Week 75
Phase 9: Warranty Period                Weeks 75-127 (12 months)
  - 12-Month Warranty Review            Week 127
```

**Critical Path (illustrative):** Design completion (100% IFC) -> Permit issuance -> Site Work start -> Main Building construction -> Commissioning -> Substantial Performance.

**Schedule note:** This is illustrative only (ASSUMPTION). Actual durations must be validated by the Scheduler and design/construction team. **Note:** The pre-warranty duration in this illustration (~75 weeks / ~17 months) falls near the boundary between the "shorter schedule (12-15 months)" and "longer schedule (18-24 months)" ranges described in T-001. The Scheduler should ensure the final proposed durations are positioned within the cost-optimized range per T-001 and that the cost-optimization rationale is consistent. See CONF-SCH-03 in the Conflict Table. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md E-002)

**Source:** RFP 7.1.8, 7.1.9; Decomposition SOW-0025; standard DB practice.

### EX-002: Cost-Optimization Narrative (Good Practice)

A good cost-optimization narrative states concrete reasons why the schedule reduces cost:

> "The proposed schedule is sequenced to optimize cost, not minimize duration. Foundation and site work are scheduled for the April-August window to avoid winter concrete and excavation premiums, estimated to reduce Phase 4 costs by 5-10%. The Cold Storage building is constructed in parallel with the Main Building superstructure, allowing the construction crew to maintain momentum during the main building MEP rough-in phase without demobilization. Long-lead items (overhead doors, generator) are procured during the 60% DD phase, eliminating expediting premiums and preventing construction delay. The resulting schedule is approximately 18 months from contract award to occupancy, which was found to minimize total cost relative to either a 12-month compressed schedule (high premium labor) or a 24-month extended schedule (high GC overhead duration)."

### EX-003: Poor Practice (What to Avoid)

A poor schedule narrative simply states: "We will complete the project in 14 months." Without:
- Phase durations and dependencies
- Critical path identification
- Explicit assumptions
- Cost-optimization rationale

Such a schedule would score poorly under the evaluation criterion (OBJ-009: "believable, optimized schedule") because it does not demonstrate PM discipline or project-specific thinking.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-SCH-01 | Total schedule duration is not specified by Owner; a very short schedule may look aggressive/uncredible; a very long schedule may undermine value. Optimal range is unclear. | RFP 7.1.9 ("believable" schedule) | RFP 2.2 ("not schedule-driven; optimize for cost") | Phase durations; Gantt chart overall length | Proponent discretion; use cost-optimization rationale to justify chosen duration | TBD |
| CONF-SCH-02 | Penhold AHJ permit review timeline is not stated in the RFP or reference documents; assumption of 6-8 weeks may be too short or too long for the specific AHJ. | RFP 7.2 (permits are Design-Builder's responsibility) | Local AHJ norms (unknown) | Phase 2 Permitting; critical path timing | Proponent assumption with explicit narrative flag; conservative estimate recommended | TBD |
| CONF-SCH-03 | EX-001 illustrative durations imply ~75 weeks (approximately 17 months) pre-warranty duration, which falls below the "12-15 months" shorter range cited in T-001 as requiring "higher peak resource intensity." T-001 frames 18-24 months as the cost-optimized range but the illustrative example shows a shorter pre-warranty duration. This creates a potential tension between the illustrative example and the cost-optimization trade-off framing. The illustrative total of ~127 weeks (29 months including warranty) is consistent with the schedule philosophy but the pre-warranty duration positioning relative to T-001 ranges should be clarified. | Guidance EX-001 (illustrative durations: ~75 weeks pre-warranty) | Guidance T-001 (cost-optimized range: 18-24 months; shorter range: 12-15 months) | EX-001 durations; T-001 trade-off framing; Scheduler duration estimation | Scheduler to validate that proposed durations in the final Gantt are consistent with T-001 cost-optimization framing; EX-001 is illustrative only and need not align exactly with T-001 ranges (PROPOSAL) | TBD |
