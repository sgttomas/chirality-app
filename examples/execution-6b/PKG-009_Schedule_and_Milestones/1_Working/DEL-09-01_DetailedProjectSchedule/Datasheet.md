## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Required Format** | Gantt chart (PDF) | RFP 7.1.9, p. 18 |
| **Schedule Scope** | Design through Construction Substantial Performance and Close-Out | RFP 7.1.9, p. 18-19 |
| **Schedule Philosophy** | NOT schedule-driven; proponents may optimize for cost/value | RFP 2.2, p. 8; Decomposition §1 |
| **Milestone Coverage** | Dates of all milestones required | RFP 7.1.9, p. 19 |
| **Critical Path** | Must be identified in the Gantt chart | RFP 7.1.9, p. 19 |
| **Work Package Coverage** | Key work packages (durations) from design through closeout | RFP 7.1.9, p. 18 |
| **Assumptions Statement** | Schedule assumptions stated explicitly | Decomposition DEL-09-01; RFP 7.1.9 |
| **Post-Award Resubmission** | Detailed baseline schedule due to Project Manager within 20 calendar days of contract award | RFP 7.2 Schedule Control, p. 19 |
| **Ongoing Updates** | Monthly schedule updates to Project Manager; shows % complete per task including approved change orders | RFP 7.2 Schedule Control, p. 19 |

## Conditions

| Condition | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Contract Award Date** | September 10, 2024 (target) | RFP 2.6 Schedule, p. 9 |
| **Substantial Completion Date** | Design-Builder to Propose. Substantial Completion (also referred to as Substantial Performance) marks the point at which the Work is ready for use for the purpose intended and is so certified; see CCDC 14-2013 GC 6.5 for contractual definition. | RFP 2.6 Schedule, p. 9; CCDC 14-2013 GC 6.5 (location TBD -- specific clause text not accessible) |
| **Total Completion Date** | Design-Builder to Propose. Total Completion is the date by which all remaining deficiencies, warranty items, and closeout activities are resolved and the Contract is fully performed; this is distinct from Substantial Completion and follows the deficiency resolution period. | RFP 2.6 Schedule, p. 9; CCDC 14-2013 (location TBD -- specific clause text not accessible) |
| **Design Submission Milestones** | Five milestones from DEL-06-02 integrated | RFP 7.1.8, p. 18; Decomposition DEL-06-02 |
| **Commissioning Phase Included** | TBD | Reference DEL-08-01 for commissioning milestone dates. **Resolution:** To be confirmed when DEL-08-01 is produced; commissioning milestones integrated at that time. |
| **Winter Construction Impacts** | TBD | Alberta climate; site grading complete per Decomposition §2. **Resolution:** Scheduler to quantify winter impact weeks during Step 3 (Duration Estimation) and Step 5 (Assumptions); see Guidance C-005 for seasonal planning framework. |
| **Permitting Lead Time** | TBD | AHJ (Alberta) building permit timing not specified in RFP. **Resolution:** Scheduler to confirm with Penhold/Red Deer County AHJ; see Conflict Table CONF-SCH-02 in Guidance.md for the identified uncertainty. |
| **Site Services Coordination** | TBD | Survey files provided after contract award per Addendum 03 §1.16. **Resolution:** Schedule Step 1 confirms design start does not depend on survey files; site services coordination timing confirmed during Step 3. |

## Construction

| **Phase 3: Permitting** | Building permit submission and approval; utility connection approvals | RFP 7.2, p. 19 |
| **Phase 4: Construction** | Site works, foundation, structure, envelope, mechanical/electrical rough-in, interior finishes, site services; includes Cold Storage building | Decomposition PKG-009; RFP §3 |
| **Phase 5: Commissioning and Closeout** | Systems commissioning, staff training, deficiency resolution, substantial performance, occupancy permit, total completion, 12-month warranty review | Decomposition DEL-08-01, DEL-08-02, DEL-08-03 |
| **Critical Path Narrative** | Written description of critical path logic, key float items, and sequencing rationale | RFP 7.1.9, p. 19 |
