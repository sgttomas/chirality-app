# Specification: Detailed Project Schedule (DEL-09-01)

## Scope

### What This Deliverable Covers

The Detailed Project Schedule is a Gantt chart (PDF) and supporting narratives documenting the project timeline from design kickoff through Construction Substantial Performance, Close-Out, and the 12-month warranty review period. It demonstrates a feasible, cost-optimized timeline leveraging the Owner's stated "not schedule-driven" philosophy.

Covers:
- Gantt chart showing all key work packages with durations, milestone dates, and critical path
- Five design submission milestones per RFP Section 7.1.8
- Construction phases for both the Main Building (Public Services Building) and Cold Storage building (60' x 100')
- Commissioning, training, deficiency resolution, occupancy permit, and 12-month warranty review
- Critical path narrative explaining the critical path logic
- Schedule assumptions list stating all material assumptions

### What This Deliverable Excludes

- Pickled sand storage building (removed per Addendum 03 §1.2; Decomposition C-10)
- Schedule control narrative during construction (covered by DEL-07-01, Construction Methodology)
- Post-award monthly schedule updates (post-award obligation per RFP 7.2; not a proposal artifact)
- Budget or cost schedule (pricing covered in PKG-001 deliverables)

**Scope sources:** RFP Section 7.1.9 (pp. 18-19); Decomposition v2.3 §9 (DEL-09-01); SOW-0025.

## Standards

| Standard / Document | Applicability | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------|-------|
| **RFP Section 7.1.9** (pp. 18-19) | Primary scheduling requirement | Directly governs Gantt format, milestones, critical path; schedule forms part of Contract once agreed |
| **RFP Section 7.2 -- Schedule Control** (p. 19) | Post-award schedule obligation | 20-day baseline submission after contract award; monthly updates; Project Committee approval |
| **RFP Section 7.1.8** (p. 18) | Design submission milestones | Five milestones to be integrated into the Gantt chart |
| **RFP Section 2.6** (p. 9) | RFP procurement schedule | Contract award target: September 10, 2024; Substantial and Total Completion = Design-Builder to Propose |
| **CCDC 14-2013 (with Appendix J Supplementary Conditions)** | Contract framework; schedule provisions | Schedule forms part of Contract once agreed; post-award schedule control requirements apply |
| **Alberta Occupational Health and Safety Act** | Construction phase; Prime Contractor obligations | Affects site mobilization timing, H&S plan development (no clause-level schedule requirement stated in RFP; location TBD) |
| **NBCC (National Building Code of Canada)** | Building permit submission | AHJ review timeline influenced by code compliance; no clause-level schedule requirement in RFP |
| **PMI scheduling conventions (CPM)** | Critical path analysis methodology | ASSUMPTION: Gantt and critical path analysis follow standard CPM conventions; no project-specific scheduling standard named in RFP. **TBD:** Confirm whether the Owner or AHJ requires a specific scheduling methodology (e.g., PMI CPM, AACE, or Owner-mandated scheduling standard). If so, this row should be updated to reflect the governing standard. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-001) |

## Verification

| Req ID | Requirement (short) | Verification Approach | Responsible |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| R-SCH-01 | Gantt format | Visual review: horizontal bar chart with time scale and activity bars | PM |
| R-SCH-02 | Key work package durations | Phase audit: Design, Permitting, Site Work, Main Building Construction, Cold Storage, Commissioning, Closeout | PM |
| R-SCH-03 | All milestone dates | Inventory check: all milestones from R-SCH-07 / R-SCH-09 / R-SCH-10 / R-SCH-14 / R-SCH-15 present and dated | PM / Scheduler |
| R-SCH-04 | Critical path in Gantt | Confirm critical path visually identified (e.g., red bars, CP flag, or explicit label) | PM |
| R-SCH-05 | Critical path narrative | Review narrative for logic explanation, float discussion, and risk items | PM |
| R-SCH-06 | Assumptions list completeness | Check assumptions cover: permit lead times, Owner review cycles, procurement lead times, weather windows, site constraints | PM / Scheduler |
| R-SCH-07 | Five design milestones | Cross-check against RFP 7.1.8 five-milestone list; confirm each named milestone appears in Gantt | Design Manager |
| R-SCH-08 | Cost optimization rationale | Narrative review with specific criteria: (1) seasonal alignment of outdoor activities demonstrated (per Guidance C-005); (2) resource leveling approach described; (3) premium avoidance measures documented (e.g., long-lead procurement timing, winter work avoidance); (4) cost-optimization rationale explicitly stated and project-specific, not generic boilerplate. All four criteria must be addressed for pass. (Source: RFP 2.2, p. 8; Specification R-SCH-08; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md C-001) | PM |
| R-SCH-09 | Award anchor date | Confirm September 10, 2024 (or stated alternative) as Day 0 | PM |
| R-SCH-10 | Substantial / Total Completion | Confirm both Substantial Completion AND Total Completion dates are present and distinctly identified in the Gantt chart. Verification must confirm: (1) both milestones appear as separate dated entries, (2) Total Completion follows Substantial Completion by a defined deficiency resolution period, and (3) both are consistent with the definitions in Datasheet.md Conditions section. (Source: RFP 2.6, p. 9; Datasheet.md Conditions; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-002) | PM |
| R-SCH-11 | Schedule commitment | Narrative and Gantt credibility review: proposed milestones are stated as commitments, not aspirational targets; durations are assumption-backed per R-SCH-06 | PM / Scheduler |
| R-SCH-12 | Schedule realistic and defensible | Peer review by PM and Scheduler; durations supported by assumptions and comparable project benchmarks. Pass criteria: individual activity durations fall within +/-20% of published industry benchmarks for comparable municipal Design-Build projects in Alberta, or deviations are explicitly justified in the assumptions list. (Source: RFP 7.1.9, p. 19; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-001) | PM / Scheduler |
| R-SCH-14 | Commissioning phase | Confirm Phase 5 commissioning and training milestones present in Gantt | Commissioning Lead |
| R-SCH-15 | 12-month warranty review | Confirm warranty review milestone approximately 12 months after occupancy permit date | PM |
| -- | Scope exclusions verification | Confirm that excluded items (Pickled Sand Storage building, post-award monthly schedule updates, budget/cost schedule) do NOT appear in the Gantt chart. This is a negative-scope verification check ensuring the produced artifact respects the stated exclusions in the Scope section. (Source: Specification Scope > What This Deliverable Excludes; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md X-002) | PM |
| -- | Quality review exit gate | All V-SCH checks (V-SCH-01 through V-SCH-13 plus scope exclusions check) must pass before the deliverable proceeds to Step 8 (Proposal Packaging). If any check fails, the responsible party must resolve the deficiency and re-verify before sign-off. The PM signs off on quality review completion as the exit gate.
