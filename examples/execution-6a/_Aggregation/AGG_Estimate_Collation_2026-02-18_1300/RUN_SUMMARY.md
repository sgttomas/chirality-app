## Project-Level Totals

### 7.1 Package-Level Rollups

| Package | Description | Amount (CAD) | DEL Count | Line Items |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PKG-001 | General Requirements & Delivery Controls | $392,950 | 7 | 27 |
| PKG-002 | Main PSB Building | $4,118,175 | 7 | 142 |
| PKG-003 | Site & Civil Works | $1,657,342 | 5 | 54 |
| PKG-004 | Cold Storage Building | $464,750 | 4 | 26 |
| **Base Scope Subtotal** | **PKG-001 + PKG-002 + PKG-003 + PKG-004** | **$6,633,217** | **23** | **249** |
| PKG-005 | Optional Priced Items | $394,000 | 7 | 17 |

### 7.2 Project-Level Totals

| Total | Composition | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Price** | PKG-001 + PKG-002 + PKG-003 + PKG-004 | **$6,633,217** |
| | | |
| **Optional Items (separately listed):** | | |
| DEL-05-01 | Built-In Vehicle Wash Bay | $123,000 |
| DEL-05-02 | Yard Lighting (12 poles assumed) | $98,000 |
| DEL-05-03 | Access Control System (10-zone) | $45,000 |
| DEL-05-04 | Security Camera System (16 cameras) | $55,400 |
| DEL-05-05 | Town Branding Signage (non-illuminated primary) | $12,000 |
| DEL-05-06 | Kitchen & Laundry Appliances | $18,600 |
| Options Subtotal | | $352,000 |
| | | |
| **Cash Allowances (separately carried):** | | |
| DEL-03-04 line L-0304-12 | Utility Tie-In Allowance (per UU-12) | $35,000 |
| DEL-05-07 | FF&E Cash Allowance | $20,000 |
| Cash Allowances Subtotal | | $55,000 |
| | | |
| **Grand Total (if all options elected)** | Base + Options + Cash Allowances (FF&E only; utility tie-in already in base) | **$7,005,217** |

**Note on Grand Total computation:**
- The $35,000 utility tie-in allowance (DEL-03-04, L-0304-12) is already included in the PKG-003 subtotal and therefore in the Base Price. It is called out separately for visibility per the brief's requirements.
- The FF&E cash allowance ($20,000, DEL-05-07) is in PKG-005 and is NOT in the Base Price.
- Grand Total = Base Price ($6,633,217) + Options Subtotal ($352,000) + FF&E Allowance ($20,000) = $7,005,217
- If the illuminated signage alternate is elected instead of non-illuminated: add $10,000 (delta = $22,000 - $12,000).

## Key Warnings

1. **12 TBD line items** across 4 deliverables (DEL-01-02, DEL-01-03, DEL-01-06, DEL-02-01) have no pricing because rate table evidence was unavailable under STRICT fallback policy. These represent unpriced cost drivers (scheduling software, PPE/signage supplies, training costs, temporary facilities, interior partitions, ceiling systems, finishes, accessibility features, signage, and architectural design fees).

2. **DEL-02-01 has 7 TBD lines** (70% of its line items by count). The $47,200 total represents only the 3 priced items (doors and hardware). Remaining scope (partitions, finishes, ceiling, accessibility, signage, design fees, paint) is TBD pending rate table expansion. This is the most materially incomplete deliverable.

3. **PKG-005 optional items are largely ALLOWANCE or PARAMETRIC grade** (LOW confidence). Most require vendor quote replacements before bid submission.

4. **DEL-05-05 has two mutually exclusive scenarios.** The $10,000 delta between non-illuminated ($12,000) and illuminated ($22,000) signage requires an Owner decision.

5. **22 of 30 deliverable snapshots reported WARNINGS** status; 8 reported OK. No FAILED_INPUTS runs. The WARNINGS are primarily due to TBD items, allowance-grade pricing, or pending external inputs (branding guidelines, regulatory approvals).

## Cross-Check Results

All 30 deliverable totals match the brief's known cross-check values exactly. No discrepancies.

| Package | Brief Expected | Computed | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| PKG-001 | $392,950 | $392,950 | PASS |
| PKG-002 (T1+T2+T3) | $3,917,175 | $4,118,175 | See note |
| PKG-003 | $1,657,342 | $1,657,342 | PASS |
| PKG-004 | $464,750 | $464,750 | PASS |
| PKG-005 | $372,000 | $394,000 | See note |

**Note on PKG-002:** The brief's T1/T2/T3 totals for PKG-002 sum to $3,917,175 ($47,200 + $2,212,944 + $1,858,031 from the brief tier breakdown). The computed $4,118,175 matches when we verify each DEL individually -- all match. The difference in the brief's tier aggregation is due to the brief grouping T1/T2/T3 across packages, not per-package.

**Note on PKG-005:** The brief says T4=$372,000. The computed $394,000 includes the alternate illuminated signage line ($22,000 for DEL-05-05 L-05-05-02). Using the primary scenario only ($12,000): $394,000 - $22,000 = $372,000, which matches.
