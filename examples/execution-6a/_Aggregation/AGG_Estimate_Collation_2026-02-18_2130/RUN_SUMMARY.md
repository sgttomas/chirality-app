### 7.2 Project-Level Totals

| Total | Composition | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Price** | PKG-001 + PKG-002 + PKG-003 + PKG-004 | **$6,825,846** |
| | | |
| **Optional Items (separately listed):** | | |
| DEL-05-01 | Built-In Vehicle Wash Bay | $123,000 |
| DEL-05-02 | Yard Lighting (12 poles assumed) | $98,000 |
| DEL-05-03 | Access Control System (10-zone) | $45,000 |
| DEL-05-04 | Security Camera System (16 cameras) | $55,400 |
| DEL-05-05 | Town Branding Signage (non-illuminated primary) | $12,000 |
| DEL-05-06 | Kitchen & Laundry Appliances | $18,600 |
| Options Subtotal | | $352,000 |
| | | |
| **Cash Allowances (separately carried):** | | |
| DEL-03-04 line L-0304-12 | Utility Tie-In Allowance (per UU-12) | $35,000 |
| DEL-05-07 | FF&E Cash Allowance | $20,000 |
| Cash Allowances Subtotal | | $55,000 |
| | | |
| **Grand Total (if all options elected)** | Base + Options + Cash Allowances (FF&E only; utility tie-in already in base) | **$7,197,846** |

**Note on Grand Total computation:**
- The $35,000 utility tie-in allowance (DEL-03-04, L-0304-12) is already included in the PKG-003 subtotal and therefore in the Base Price. It is called out separately for visibility per the brief's requirements.
- The FF&E cash allowance ($20,000, DEL-05-07) is in PKG-005 and is NOT in the Base Price.
- Grand Total = Base Price ($6,825,846) + Options Subtotal ($352,000) + FF&E Allowance ($20,000) = $7,197,846
- If the illuminated signage alternate is elected instead of non-illuminated: add $10,000 (delta = $22,000 - $12,000).

## Key Warnings

1. **All 12 previously-TBD line items have been resolved.** TBD count is now 0, compared to 12 in the prior snapshot. The 12 resolved items added $192,629 to the base price.

2. **5 of the 12 resolved items use ALLOWANCE method** (parametric allowances for scheduling software, training, PPE/signage, temporary facilities, and site cleaning). These remain LOW confidence and should be validated against actual costs during construction.

3. **DEL-02-01 increased by $121,129 (+256%)** from $47,200 to $168,329. The 7 previously-TBD lines (partitions, finishes, ceiling, accessibility, signage, paint, design fees) are now priced using the new Interior_Architectural_Rates.csv price source (PS-27). This was the most materially incomplete deliverable in the prior snapshot.

4. **PKG-005 optional items remain largely ALLOWANCE or PARAMETRIC grade** (LOW confidence). Most require vendor quote replacements before bid submission.

5. **DEL-05-05 still has two mutually exclusive scenarios.** The $10,000 delta between non-illuminated ($12,000) and illuminated ($22,000) signage requires an Owner decision.

6. **22 of 30 deliverable snapshots still report WARNINGS status** (from the 26 unchanged snapshots). The 4 updated snapshots now have updated status. No FAILED_INPUTS runs.
