TBD: HVAC systems supporting essential spaces (kitchen, two bathrooms at minimum) shall be designed with awareness of the generator essential-loads list, coordinating with DEL-02-07. Non-essential HVAC may be shed during generator operation. This requirement is pending confirmation through coordination with DEL-02-07; until confirmed, the "shall" language is provisional.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.15 (generator essentials); ASSUMPTION for mechanical interface
**Label:** TBD — originally labeled ASSUMPTION with "shall" language; per Lensing D-001, the ASSUMPTION label and "shall" language create ambiguity. This requirement remains TBD until DEL-02-07 coordination confirms scope boundary. If confirmed as mandatory, remove the TBD label. If not confirmed, convert to a coordination note.

TBD: Confirm whether the Evaluation Committee requires additional content or specific format — see RFP §4.1 for evaluation criteria context.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.2 (.4)
**Label:** Explicit requirement (evaluation criteria added per Lensing D-003 — the original requirement was a presence check only; minimum content expectations added to enable qualitative evaluation of the brief's merit)

---

### REQ-M-15: HVAC Energy Efficiency (ASSUMPTION — Pending Confirmation)

ASSUMPTION: If ASHRAE Standard 90.1 (or provincial energy code equivalent) applies to this facility, the HVAC systems shall be designed to meet the minimum energy efficiency requirements of the applicable standard.

Ventilation design shall comply with NFPA 1581 (or equivalent) guidance for fire station decontamination facilities. A dedicated decontamination area exhaust ventilation requirement is warranted per Lensing X-001 (directive scope for ventilation is incomplete without explicitly addressing this space).

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — based on industry practice for fire station decontamination zones; Guidance C-04 discusses negative pressure relationship; no explicit Owner requirement found in OSR or Addendum 03 (Lensing X-001)
