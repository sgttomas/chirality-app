# Guidance: DEL-02-05 — Mechanical, Plumbing, Ventilation & Exhaust

## Purpose

This deliverable establishes the mechanical, plumbing, ventilation, and exhaust design basis for the Main Public Services Building (PSB). It exists to:

1. Demonstrate that the Design-Builder understands the distinct ventilation requirements of a combined Fire Department + Public Works operations facility, where vehicle exhaust safety and operational reliability are non-negotiable.
2. Provide the Owner with sufficient information to evaluate the proposed mechanical approach at the proposal stage (Mechanical Design Brief per RFP §7.1.2).
3. Establish a documented basis of design that governs subsequent detailed design and IFC drawing production.
4. Ensure cross-discipline coordination hooks are identified early — particularly the interfaces with emergency power (DEL-02-07), electrical systems (DEL-02-06), architectural layout (DEL-02-01), and firehall bay systems (DEL-02-02).

## Principles

### P-01: Safety-First Ventilation for Apparatus Bays

Direct exhaust ventilation in fire apparatus bays is a life-safety measure — not a comfort feature. Diesel exhaust from fire apparatus contains carcinogens and particulates that accumulate rapidly in enclosed bays. The two-apparatus-per-bay design criterion (Addendum 03 §1.12) means the system must be capable of capturing exhaust from simultaneous apparatus departures or arrivals. The design basis should ensure:
- Capture efficiency at the tailpipe (hose reel, rail, or direct connection approach)
- Adequate exhaust fan capacity and duct sizing for the diesel exhaust loads
- System integration with bay door operation (doors open before apparatus moves — coordinate with DEL-02-04 and DEL-02-07)

### P-02: PW Bay Ventilation — Proportionate to Actual Use

The Owner has confirmed (Addendum 03 §1.11) that PW bays are used for occasional short-term vehicle idling and very occasional welding — a dedicated welding bay is not required. The ventilation system should be proportionate to this use profile: a robust general ventilation system (supply and exhaust air changes meeting code requirements) rather than an industrial point-source welding exhaust system. Over-engineering this system adds capital cost without operational benefit for this facility type.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.11

### P-03: Plumbing — No On-Site Storm Sewer

The site has no storm sewer. This is a key constraint affecting roof drainage design, bay sump drainage discharge, and condensation management. All drainage must ultimately reach natural drainage off-site or be handled through appropriate infiltration or collection strategies. The Design-Builder must coordinate with the civil/site team (DEL-03-02) to ensure compatibility between building drainage discharge points and site drainage design.

**Source:** OSR §11.2; OSR §10.3.2

### P-04: Bay Sumps — Practical Drainage for Operations

Bay sumps serve a practical purpose: snow and ice brought in on vehicles melts in the heated bays. Minor washing also occurs. The sumps must be functional but need not be sized for heavy-duty wash operations (a built-in wash bay, if selected, is a separate optional item — DEL-05-01). The sump drain sizing, interceptor requirements, and discharge connection must comply with applicable municipal requirements for the Town of Penhold. ASSUMPTION: the local municipal utility authority governs interceptor requirements; confirm with AHJ during permitting.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.8; ASSUMPTION for interceptor/discharge requirements

### P-05: Water Fill Stations — Operational Necessity for Fire Department

Water fill stations are standard fire department infrastructure. The minimum 2-inch connection (Addendum 03 §1.16) supports rapid refilling of apparatus tanks. Ground-level location is confirmed. The Design-Builder should consider:
- Connection to the domestic water supply (potable or non-potable, coordinate with plumbing basis)
- Location within the apparatus bay that does not conflict with apparatus maneuvering
- Coordination with the PW fill station location for consistency

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.16; SOW-0223

### P-06: Maintainability and 50-Year Design Life

OSR §10.2 establishes a 50-year design life for the main building. Mechanical systems have shorter typical lifecycles (HVAC equipment: 15-25 years; plumbing fixtures: 20-30 years). The design should account for:
- Accessible equipment rooms for maintenance (coordinate with architectural program, DEL-02-01)
- Serviceable duct routing that allows future replacement
- Equipment selection favoring proven, locally-serviceable products
- Modular or zoned systems that allow partial replacement without full system shutdown

**Minimum equipment quality expectations (Lensing F-003):** The 50-year design life context implies that mechanical equipment should meet a minimum quality floor, even though no explicit Owner requirement defines equipment grade. The following quality considerations should inform equipment selection:
- **Equipment grade:** TBD -- confirm with Owner whether commercial-grade or industrial-grade equipment is expected for this facility type. ASSUMPTION: commercial-grade minimum for a combined Fire/PW operations facility.
- **Warranty duration:** TBD -- confirm minimum acceptable manufacturer warranty period. ASSUMPTION: standard manufacturer warranty (typically 1-5 years depending on equipment type) unless Owner specifies extended warranty requirements.
- **Local serviceability:** Equipment should be available from manufacturers with regional service/parts networks accessible from central Alberta (Penhold area). ASSUMPTION: this is consistent with the intent of "locally-serviceable products."
- **Replacement cycle alignment:** Equipment replacement intervals should be considered in lifecycle costing to identify systems that may require 2-3 replacement cycles within the 50-year building life.

**Source:** OSR §10.2; SOW-0220; ASSUMPTION: maintainability principles consistent with RFP §7.1.4; quality floor considerations are ASSUMPTION per Lensing F-003

## Considerations

### C-01: Compressed Air Interface — Scope Boundary

The Functional Program (OSR Appendix B, p.46) notes "compressed air lines dropped from ceiling" in apparatus bays. Compressed air is referenced in SOW-0203 under DEL-02-02 (Firehall Functional Areas). The Design-Builder must clarify internally whether compressed air system design and distribution (compressor, piping, drops) is coordinated through this deliverable (DEL-02-05, mechanical) or DEL-02-02. This deliverable covers the plumbing basis; the compressed air system may be treated as a sub-set of the mechanical scope. See Conflict Table.

**Source:** Functional Program (OSR Appendix B); SOW-0203; ASSUMPTION

### C-02: Mechanical Room Programming

The Functional Program indicates a mechanical/sprinkler room in the program. The Design-Builder must size the mechanical room to accommodate the HVAC, plumbing, and compressed air equipment. Room sizing is at the Design-Builder's discretion (Addendum 01 §1.2 notes some spaces are left without prescribed dimensions). Coordinate with DEL-02-01 (Architectural Program) for room allocation.

**Source:** Functional Program (OSR Appendix B); Addendum 01 §1.2

### C-03: HVAC Coordination with Emergency Power

Addendum 03 §1.15 confirms that the generator must run kitchen, meeting room (Incident Command Post), and two bathrooms at minimum. The mechanical designer must confirm which HVAC/plumbing systems are on the essential load (e.g., ventilation for kitchen, decontamination area, washrooms). Non-essential systems (PW bay ventilation, apparatus bay exhaust) may be shed during generator operation unless specified otherwise. Coordinate with DEL-02-07.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.15; ASSUMPTION for load shedding approach

### C-04: Bunker Gear Room Ventilation — Decontamination Context

The bunker gear locker room is adjacent to the decontamination area. Ventilation of this room should consider whether any decontamination chemical vapors or odors could enter the bunker gear room through shared ventilation. Negative pressure relative to adjacent decontamination spaces may be warranted. This is an ASSUMPTION based on industry practice; confirm with AHJ during design.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — industry practice for fire station decontamination zones

### C-05: PW Bay Welding Ventilation — Code Compliance

Even without a dedicated welding exhaust system, code requirements for welding fume management may apply when welding occurs in the bays. The Design-Builder should confirm with AHJ whether supplemental dilution ventilation rates or local exhaust provisions are required. The Owner's statement (Addendum 03 §1.11) is performance-based: "adequate ventilation."

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.11; ASSUMPTION: applicable code may impose ventilation rate minimums

### C-06: Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Monitoring -- Apparatus and PW Bays (Lensing E-002)

Apparatus bays handle diesel exhaust (classified as a carcinogen); PW bays handle welding fumes. Neither the Specification nor the Guidance currently addresses indoor air quality monitoring, CO/NO2 detection, or alarm systems for these spaces. **This consideration is flagged as a critical operational prerequisite (E:operative:necessity) for occupant safety** per Lensing E-002. The Design-Builder should conduct a code review and consider:
- **CO detection in apparatus bays:** ASSUMPTION -- likely required by the applicable fire code (NFPA 1500 or provincial equivalent) for fire station apparatus bays. Carbon monoxide detectors with audible/visual alarms would provide an early warning of exhaust system failure and occupant protection from carcinogenic diesel exhaust exposure.
- **CO/NO2 detection in PW bays:** TBD -- confirm with AHJ whether vehicle maintenance areas require gas detection. The intermittent use profile (occasional idling) may affect the applicable threshold.
- **Interlock with ventilation systems:** If gas detection is provided, consider interlocking detectors with exhaust fans to provide automatic ventilation response in the event of elevated contaminant levels.

**If required by code, corresponding requirements should be added to Specification.md as a binding obligation.** This consideration remains flagged as a critical operational prerequisite until confirmed or explicitly ruled out during design.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION -- based on occupational health and safety considerations for fire station and vehicle maintenance facilities; no explicit Owner requirement found in OSR or Addendum 03; Lensing E-002; NFPA 1500/1581 likely applicability per Lensing E-001

### C-07: PW Bay Count Assumption -- Rationale and Dependency (Lensing C-003)

Procedure step A-7 assumes four (4) PW bays based on SOW-0211. This assumption directly affects the total sump count (currently assumed at eight: four Fire + four PW). The rationale for assuming four PW bays is as follows:
- SOW-0211 references "Public Works Shop Bays" and the Functional Program indicates a four-bay drive-through configuration for PW operations.
- The decomposition maps SOW-0211 to DEL-02-03 (PW Shop Bays), which is the authoritative deliverable for bay count and configuration.
- **Dependency:** The exact PW bay count must be confirmed by DEL-02-03 before sump design can be finalized. If DEL-02-03 specifies a different bay count, the sump count in this deliverable must be updated accordingly.

This is an essential operational capacity question because it affects sump quantity, mechanical room sizing (for drainage capacity), and plumbing infrastructure.

## Trade-offs

### T-01: Direct Exhaust System Type — Hose Reel vs. Rail vs. Fixed Drops

**Tension:** Capital cost vs. operational flexibility (Lensing A-006 — worth determination has no defined criteria without lifecycle evaluation framework).
- Hose reel systems (ceiling-mounted): higher capital cost, most flexible -- apparatus can park in variable positions.
- Rail-mounted systems: moderate cost, flexible within rail extent.
- Fixed ceiling drops: lowest cost, least flexible -- apparatus must park in prescribed positions.
**Resolution:** The Owner has not prescribed the system type; Design-Builder to propose. For a fire department that will use this facility for 50 years, hose reel or rail systems are likely the better lifecycle choice. Fixed drops create operational constraints if apparatus fleet changes.

**Lifecycle cost evaluation framework (Lensing A-006):** When comparing exhaust system types (and other major mechanical system selections), the Design-Builder should employ a structured lifecycle cost evaluation that includes:
- Capital cost (procurement + installation)
- Estimated annual maintenance cost (labor, parts, inspections)
- Expected equipment replacement interval within the 50-year building life
- Operational flexibility / adaptability to apparatus fleet changes or facility modifications
- Total lifecycle cost (NPV or equivalent) over the full 50-year building design life using a discount rate TBD by Owner

This structured evaluation supports "worth determination" per Lensing A-006 — a fundamental evaluation criterion for long-lived infrastructure assets. TBD -- the Owner has not specified a lifecycle cost analysis methodology, discount rate, or whether this analysis is required as part of the Mechanical Design Brief. **The Design-Builder should confirm whether a formal lifecycle cost comparison is expected as part of the Mechanical Design Brief (RFP §7.1.2) during proposal stage.**

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (system type selection); OSR §11.1.1 and Addendum 03 §1.12 state requirement only; lifecycle cost framework is ASSUMPTION per Lensing A-006 (evaluative:judging — worth determination criterion)

### T-02: Bay Sump Sizing — Snow Melt Only vs. Wash-Ready

**Tension:** Sizing sumps only for snow melt (minor) vs. sizing for minor wash operations.
The Owner confirmed "snow melting and minor washing" (Addendum 03 §1.8). The Design-Builder must decide whether to size for peak snow-melt events (e.g., multiple large vehicles bringing in significant snow) or include margin for the washing use. Over-sizing sump capacity is low-cost insurance against future complaints; under-sizing creates operational nuisance.
**Resolution:** ASSUMPTION — size for minor washing as the governing case; confirm with Owner during design development.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.8; ASSUMPTION

### T-03: Separate vs. Combined Domestic Water Supply for Fill Stations

**Tension:** Potable supply continuity vs. dedicated fill station pipe sizing.
Water fill stations at 2" minimum connection draw significant flow when in use. Sharing the main domestic water supply without hydraulic analysis could reduce pressure to other fixtures. The Design-Builder may consider a separate dedicated fill station supply line from the service entry.
**Resolution:** TBD — subject to hydraulic analysis during design development.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.16; ASSUMPTION

## Examples

TBD — No project-specific precedent examples are available in accessible source materials. Examples of direct exhaust system types and bay sump configurations may be referenced from manufacturer technical data during design development.
