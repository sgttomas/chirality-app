# Deliverable: DEL-02-04 Structure, Envelope, Roof & Overhead Doors

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the physical protection and structural endurance of a municipal operations building over a 50-year lifecycle. It must carry knowledge about how building systems (structure, envelope, roof, doors, flooring) resist environmental loads, maintain weather-tightness, support operational continuity for emergency services, and accommodate future adaptation -- all through material selection, assembly design, and durability strategy rather than through mechanical or electrical systems.
