# Guidance: DEL-02-04 — Structure, Envelope, Roof & Overhead Doors

---

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to establish the structural and envelope basis of the Main Public Services Building (PSB) — the foundational layer that determines how long the building performs, how it responds to future needs, and how it protects its operations from the environment.

The Owner has set a 50-year design life expectation (OSR §10.2) and has asked the Design-Builder to explicitly demonstrate durability/ease of repair (RFP §7.1.4) and adaptability/expansion potential (RFP §7.1.5) as scored evaluation criteria. These are not incidental to this deliverable — they are central to it.

This deliverable also addresses overhead doors and flooring because these elements are primary durability interfaces: overhead doors are high-wear, high-consequence components (they must work every time, including during emergencies), and flooring is the most heavily used interior surface in an operations facility.

## Principles

### P-01: 50-Year Lifecycle as a Design Driver
Design decisions should be evaluated against the full 50-year building life, not just first cost. Materials and assemblies that cost more upfront but substantially reduce maintenance burden or replacement frequency over 50 years are consistent with the Owner's stated intent. Source: OSR §10.2; RFP §7.1.4.

**Lifecycle Cost Evaluation Framework:** To support merit application of this principle, the DB should adopt or reference a recognized lifecycle cost comparison methodology for 50-year material selection decisions. The evaluation framework should enable defensible comparison of material alternatives over the full 50-year design life and should address: (a) initial capital cost, (b) projected maintenance intervals and costs, (c) expected component replacement schedule and costs, (d) discount rate and inflation assumptions, and (e) net present value or annualized cost comparison. Examples of applicable methodologies include ASTM E917 or equivalent. Specific methodology TBD — DB to propose and document in the durability narrative. [Lensing: A-005, D-003]

### P-02: Operational Continuity Drives Structural and Door Design
The facility houses emergency services (volunteer fire department). Structural failures and door failures are not merely inconvenient — they can interrupt emergency response. The structural system must be robust and the overhead door secondary opening mechanism (R-15) is an explicit safety requirement, not an optional feature. Source: Addendum 03 §1.15; OSR §10.3.9.

**Door Opening Speed as Operational Readiness:** For a volunteer fire hall, the time from door activation to full open is a critical operational readiness factor directly affecting emergency apparatus deployment. The DB should consider overhead door opening speed requirements when specifying door operators and hardware. Industry practice for fire hall overhead doors typically targets full opening in under 30 seconds from activation. The DB should confirm the required opening time with the fire department operational staff and select door operators capable of meeting this requirement. This consideration should be explicitly documented in the door specification and durability narrative. [Lensing: C-003]

### P-03: Solar Readiness Is a Structural Commitment, Not an Afterthought
The Owner requires a solar-capable roof (R-10). This means the structural system must be designed now to carry future solar panel loads (dead load addition), not retrofitted later. The DB should state the assumed solar loading allowance in the structural design basis. Source: OSR §10.3.9; Addendum 03 §1.17.

### P-04: Low Maintenance Over Optimization
For a municipal operations facility with limited in-house maintenance expertise, maintainability and replaceability take priority over marginal performance optimization. Sealed concrete floors (R-18) are a good example: they are not the highest-performing finish, but they are durable, repairable with standard trades, and easily cleaned. Source: Addendum 03 §1.3; OSR §10.3.8.

### P-05: DB Selects Structural System Within Performance Bounds
The Owner has not prescribed a structural system for the main building. The Design-Builder selects the system — pre-engineered metal building, steel-framed with cladding, concrete tilt-up, or hybrid — subject to meeting all load requirements, clear height requirements, adaptability goals, and the 50-year design life. Source: OSR §10.3.4; OSR §10.3.6.

### P-06: Weather-Tightness Is Non-Negotiable
The building envelope must prevent water and moisture ingress (R-08). In Penhold, Alberta's cold climate, envelope failures lead to freeze-thaw deterioration, ice damming, and condensation — all of which dramatically shorten building life and increase maintenance costs. The DB should give particular attention to roof-to-wall transitions, overhead door headers, and slab-edge details.

**Vapour Barrier Continuity Strategy:** For cold climate envelope assemblies, the DB should develop and document a vapour barrier continuity strategy addressing: (a) vapour barrier placement relative to insulation (warm side of assembly), (b) continuity at transitions (roof-to-wall, wall-to-foundation, around penetrations), (c) condensation risk mitigation at thermal bridge locations (structural connections, window/door frames, slab edges), and (d) coordination with the air barrier system. Procedure Step A-3 requires air/vapour barrier continuity; this consideration provides the knowledge framework for that procedural step. [Lensing: B-005]

## Considerations

### C-01: Penhold Climate Context
Penhold, Alberta experiences cold winters (significant snow loads), high winds, and wide freeze-thaw cycling. The structural system, roof drainage, and envelope must all be designed for this context. Specific design loads should be confirmed from the Alberta Building Code and applicable NBC climatic data for the Penhold area. Source: OSR §10.3.5.

### C-02: Heavy Equipment Loads on Floors
Bay floors (R-17) will be subject to heavy loads from Type 1 fire apparatus, aerial trucks, tandem dump trucks, graders, and loaders (OSR §10.3.5). Concrete slab thickness and reinforcement should be sized for these loads, not for typical commercial occupancy. **ASSUMPTION:** Floor slab design load parameters (vehicle axle loads, point loads) will be confirmed by the DB structural engineer during detailed design.

### C-03: Bay Sumps and Floor Drainage Slope
All bays require sumps for snow melt and minor washing (Addendum 03 §1.8; DEL-02-05 scope for plumbing). The bay concrete floors (R-17) must slope to these sumps. The floor design must coordinate slab slopes with door thresholds and equipment approach grades. This is a DEL-02-04/DEL-02-05 interface — sump locations and floor slopes should be coordinated between the architectural/structural and mechanical teams.

### C-04: Overhead Door Orientation and Glazing
OSR §10.3.9 states that glazing material (poly vs metal panels) should reflect the direction the doors face — poly is preferred where natural lighting is desirable, metal where glare or heat gain is a concern. The DB should note the orientation of each bay and select accordingly.

### C-05: "Car Wash" Grade Hardware — What This Means
Addendum 03 §1.10 specifies "car wash" grade hardware for main building overhead doors. This refers to hardware designed for high-humidity, wash-down, and condensation environments — typically involving stainless steel or galvanized hardware, sealed bearings, and corrosion-resistant springs. The DB should confirm the intended hardware specification with the door supplier and include product data sheets in the design brief.

### C-06: Secondary Door Opening Mechanism — Integration with Generator Design
The secondary opening mechanism requirement (R-15) creates an interface with DEL-02-07 (Emergency Power and Backup Generator). Two options exist: (a) doors are connected to the backup power circuit, or (b) doors have a manual override operable without power. The DB should clarify which approach is used in this deliverable and coordinate with DEL-02-07.

### C-07: Future Expansion Structural Provision
RFP §7.1.5 requires the DB to demonstrate adaptability and future expansion potential. For structural design, this typically means: (a) designing foundations with capacity for additional loads, (b) locating major structural elements to avoid blocking natural expansion directions, and (c) noting which exterior walls are "expansion-ready" (e.g., designed as demountable or readily removable).

### C-08: Geotechnical Report Adequacy
A Geotechnical Investigation Report is provided in RFP Appendix D. The DB must assess whether this report is sufficient for foundation design. If additional investigation is needed, the DB bears the cost (OSR §10.3.6). This risk should be evaluated early during design.

## Trade-offs

### RFP Evaluation Scoring Context
R-07 (adaptability/expansion) and R-09 (durability narrative) are labeled as proposal evaluation criteria. The DB should be aware that RFP Section 7.1.4 (durability/ease of repair) and RFP Section 7.1.5 (adaptability/flexibility/expansion) carry evaluation scoring weights in the proposal evaluation framework. The DB should explicitly reference these scoring criteria and confirm the relative importance in the RFP evaluation rubric to guide material selection trade-offs. For example, if durability carries 40% of the structural/envelope evaluation score while adaptability carries 25%, the DB should prioritize durability-driven design choices (e.g., sealed concrete with industrial-grade sealers over upgraded epoxy, if lifecycle cost favors sealed concrete). Without this scoring context, the DB may over- or under-invest in one criterion relative to the evaluation framework expectations. [Lensing: F-004]

### T-01: Pre-Engineered Metal Building (PEMB) vs. Conventional Steel
**Tension:** PEMB structures are typically lower first-cost and faster to erect; conventional steel framing offers more design flexibility and potentially longer durability.
**Resolution:** TBD — DB to propose and justify. The Owner is open to alternative configurations (OSR §10.3.4). Either can achieve the 50-year design life with proper detailing.
**Consideration:** PEMB structures can have warranty and performance advantages for clear-span bay applications; however, they may have less inherent flexibility for future expansion modifications.

### T-02: Sealed Concrete vs. Higher-Performance Floor Finishes
**Tension:** Sealed concrete is explicitly acceptable (Addendum 03 §1.3) and is low-cost; higher-performance finishes (epoxy, polyurea, polished) offer better chemical resistance and aesthetics.
**Resolution:** Sealed concrete is appropriate per Owner direction. Upgrades may be proposed as options but should not be assumed as base scope.
**Consideration:** Bay floors will be subject to heavy vehicle traffic and occasional spills. Concrete sealers must be industrial-grade and reapplicable; include maintenance protocol in durability narrative.

### T-03: Flat Roof vs. Sloped Roof (Solar Orientation)
**Tension:** Flat roofs are simpler to frame and lower first-cost; sloped roofs to S/SW/W maximize solar energy potential and provide better drainage.
**Resolution:** Both are acceptable per Addendum 03 §1.17 and OSR §10.3.9. DB to select and justify.
**Consideration:** A south or southwest slope maximizes solar panel productivity; a flat roof requires careful drainage design (controlled drainage slopes, overflow scuppers) but simplifies construction in a large-bay building.

### T-04: "Car Wash" Grade vs. Standard Hardware
**Tension:** Car wash grade hardware costs more than standard industrial hardware.
**Resolution:** This is a non-negotiable requirement for the main building (Addendum 03 §1.10). Standard grade hardware is only permitted for the cold storage building (OSR §10.3.9; DEL-04-02 scope). Do not specify standard grade hardware for main building overhead doors.

## Examples

### Example: Solar Loading Allowance
**ASSUMPTION (illustrative only):** A typical solar loading allowance for future PV panel installation is approximately 3–5 psf additional dead load on the roof structure (depending on panel mounting system). The DB structural engineer should confirm the appropriate allowance for the proposed system and note it in the structural design basis narrative. This value is an ASSUMPTION and must be confirmed by the DB.

### Example: Durability Narrative Structure
The RFP §7.1.4 durability narrative should logically address: (1) structural system durability rationale (service life, corrosion protection, maintenance approach); (2) envelope assembly selection and expected maintenance schedule (inspection frequency, resealing intervals, thermal/air barrier strategy); (3) door hardware specification and expected service life, including impact of opening speed and frequency on wear; (4) flooring specification and maintenance protocol (sealer reapplication frequency, acceptable cleaning methods, expected lifetime of sealed concrete); (5) expected repair/replacement schedule for major components over 50 years with cost estimates.

**O&M Cost Projection Methodology:** To support the RFP §7.1.4 evaluation criterion on durability/ease of repair, the durability narrative should include a quantified lifecycle cost comparison framework. This methodology should address: (a) estimated replacement intervals for major components (roof membrane, sealants, door operators, floor sealers) with justification from manufacturer data or industry norms; (b) estimated annual maintenance costs by system (e.g., annual cost for roof inspection and minor repairs, cost per sealer reapplication); (c) net present value or annualized cost comparison of competing material alternatives (e.g., sealed concrete vs. epoxy flooring, PEMB vs. conventional steel); (d) explicit assumptions regarding discount rate, inflation rate, and economic life. This framework enables defensible merit judgments on material alternatives and demonstrates alignment with the Owner's 50-year lifecycle intent. Specific methodology TBD — DB to propose in the durability narrative. [Lensing: A-005, D-003]

## Vocabulary Note

**Canonical term: "Durability Narrative"** — Three different phrasings are used across the DEL-02-04 documents for the same deliverable artifact: "durability/lifecycle strategy" (Datasheet, Procedure), "durability narrative" (Guidance), and "durability/ease of repair" (RFP §7.1.4 as cited). To avoid confusion about whether these refer to the same or distinct items, the canonical term across all DEL-02-04 documents should be **"Durability Narrative"** as used in the Guidance Examples and aligned with RFP §7.1.4 evaluation criteria. The Datasheet and Procedure documents retain their current phrasing but should be understood as referring to this same artifact. [Lensing: E-003]

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CON-01 | OSR §10.3.8 describes two options for cold storage flooring (asphalt millings vs. concrete), but DEC-002 (Gate 2) directs DB to propose one floor solution — no required base vs alternate. The cold storage flooring is out of scope for this deliverable (DEL-04-03), but if the DB includes cold storage flooring in this document, there may be conflicting guidance. | OSR §10.3.8 (two options) | Project Decomposition DEC-002 (Gate 2 decision: single floor solution) | DEL-02-04 scope boundary vs. DEL-04-03 | Follow decomposition: cold storage flooring belongs to DEL-04-03; DEL-02-04 covers main building flooring only. | TBD |
