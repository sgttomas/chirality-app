| Hardware grade — main building | "Car wash" grade hardware (durable, exposure-rated). DB shall specify the applicable product standard or industry benchmark (e.g., DASMA rating, stainless steel grade specification, or equivalent industry benchmark) to prevent inconsistent supplier interpretation.
