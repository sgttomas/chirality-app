**Statement:** All structural, envelope, and door work shall comply with the Alberta Building Code and requirements of all Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).
**Source:** RFP §7.2; RFP §7.1.3
**Label:** Explicit requirement.

### R-21: Fire-Resistance Rating
**Statement:** Structural elements and envelope assemblies shall meet the fire-resistance ratings required by the Alberta Building Code for the applicable occupancy classification (occupancy determined by the building's function as a combined fire hall and public works facility housing apparatus and equipment). **The specific fire-resistance rating(s) required shall be explicitly confirmed by the DB and stated in the structural design basis and on construction drawings.** This requirement applies regardless of whether a specific occupancy classification exemption is granted; fire-resistance shall be determined based on the building's actual use.
**Source:** **ASSUMPTION:** Derived from code compliance requirement (RFP §7.2) and the building's occupancy type (fire apparatus and public works equipment storage). No specific fire-resistance rating is stated in RFP/OSR sources; however, total prescriptive accounting for a building of this critical occupancy type requires an explicit requirement.
**Label:** Explicit requirement (ASSUMPTION-to-explicit conversion). **Note:** Fire-resistance rating confirmation required for total prescriptive accounting (F-002). [Lensing: F-002]

### R-22: Building Envelope — Thermal Insulation Performance
**Statement:** Building envelope insulation shall meet or exceed the minimum thermal performance values required by the applicable Alberta energy code (NECB or equivalent applicable standard). **Specific insulation R-values (effective resistance) for wall and roof assemblies shall be confirmed by the DB and documented in the design brief, with verification that values meet or exceed the applicable code minimum for the Penhold, AB climate zone.** Design review and field verification of insulation installation shall be performed to confirm conformance.
**Source:** Code compliance requirement (RFP §7.2). R-08 addresses weather-tightness (water/moisture) but not thermal performance. Confirmed prescriptive sufficiency for a 50-year cold-climate building requires explicit insulation verification.
**Label:** Explicit requirement (ASSUMPTION-to-explicit conversion). **Note:** Specific values TBD pending DB confirmation against applicable energy code; field verification method required (E-001). [Lensing: E-001]

### TBD-01: Acoustic Performance (Scope Determination Required)
**Statement:** TBD — Determine whether acoustic performance requirements for the building envelope or party walls (e.g., STC rating for walls between fire hall and public works areas, or exterior noise attenuation) are within the scope of this deliverable or are assigned elsewhere (e.g., DEL-02-01 Architectural Program).
**Source:** No acoustic performance requirement found in available RFP/OSR sources for this deliverable. For a building housing fire apparatus (sirens, air horns, diesel engines) adjacent to office/shared spaces, acoustic separation may be necessary.
**Label:** TBD — scope assignment question; may be covered by DEL-02-01 but not explicitly cross-referenced. [Lensing: X-001]
