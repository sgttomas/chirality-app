## Steps

### Part A — Narrative Production Procedure

**Step A-1: Establish Structural Design Basis**
- Determine structural system type (PEMB, conventional steel, tilt-up, hybrid) based on bay size requirements, clear height requirements (16 ft min), solar loading provision, and adaptability goals.
- Confirm design loads for Penhold, AB from Alberta Building Code / NBC climatic data.
- Establish solar loading allowance for future PV (note as ASSUMPTION if not confirmed by panel supplier).
- Review Geotechnical Investigation Report (RFP Appendix D); determine if additional investigation is required.
- Document the foundation type selection with rationale.
- Output: Structural design basis summary (1–2 pages) for inclusion in Design Brief.

**Step A-2: Develop Roof Design Concept**
- Select roof orientation (flat, SW/S/W sloped) with justification; confirm solar capability.
- Establish drainage strategy (slopes, drainage points, overflow; coordinate with DEL-03-02 civil/stormwater).
- Identify roof assembly (insulation, membrane/metal system, vapour barrier) — specify or note as TBD for detailed design.
- Document solar loading allowance in structural basis.
- Output: Roof design narrative and schematic roof plan.

**Step A-3: Develop Envelope Assembly Concepts**
- Select wall assembly type(s) appropriate for cold climate and 50-year design life; address thermal performance (specify minimum R-values for walls and roof), air/vapour barrier continuity, and durability.
- Develop a vapour barrier continuity strategy addressing: (a) vapour barrier placement relative to insulation (warm side of assembly), (b) continuity at key transitions (roof-to-wall, wall-to-foundation, around penetrations), (c) condensation risk mitigation at thermal bridge locations (structural connections, window/door frames, slab edges), and (d) coordination with the air barrier system. [Lensing: B-005]
- Identify key envelope details at critical junctions: roof-wall, slab-edge, overhead door header, window/door openings.
- Note maintenance schedule/strategy for envelope components (inspection frequency, resealing intervals, etc.).
- Output: Envelope assembly summary (wall types, thermal performance, key details, vapour barrier strategy) for Design Brief.

**Step A-4: Develop Overhead Door Schedule and Specifications**
- Confirm door count and bay assignments (coordinate with DEL-02-02 and DEL-02-03). [Lensing: B-003]
- Specify all main building overhead doors as 16' × 16' with motorized openers and car wash grade hardware; include product standard reference or industry benchmark for "car wash grade" (e.g., DASMA rating, stainless steel grade). [Lensing: A-002]
- Specify opening speed requirement (recommend confirming with fire department that doors shall open fully in under 30 seconds to support emergency apparatus deployment). [Lensing: C-003]
- Specify glazing type per door orientation (poly or metal panels).
- Define secondary opening mechanism (manual override or backup generator circuit; coordinate with DEL-02-07).
- Include person door locations, count basis, accessibility standard compliance (e.g., barrier-free path of travel per ABC), and hardware grade. [Lensing: B-004]
- Output: Door schedule draft (overhead + person doors) with product standard references, opening speed requirement, and hardware specification notes.

**Step A-5: Develop Flooring Strategy Narrative**
- Specify bay areas: concrete slab designed for vehicle axle loads and point loads appropriate to the equipment types (Type 1 fire engines, aerial apparatus, tandem dump trucks, graders, loaders, bobcats). Confirm design loads with structural engineer. [Lensing: A-004, E-002]
- Specify slab flatness/levelness tolerance (TBD — e.g., per ACI 117 or equivalent heavy vehicle traffic standard) and include tolerance specification in structural design basis.
- Specify shared/office spaces: sealed concrete or equivalent resilient material, easily cleaned.
- Note maintenance protocol for sealed concrete (reapplication frequency, acceptable products, cleaning methods compatible with sealers).
- Coordinate floor slab slopes to bay sumps with DEL-02-05 (Mechanical).
- Output: Flooring strategy narrative for Design Brief including vehicle load assumptions and slab tolerance specification.

**Step A-6: Write Durability/Lifecycle Strategy**
- Compile findings from Steps A-1 through A-5 into a cohesive durability narrative addressing RFP §7.1.4 requirements.
- Address structural system durability; envelope assembly selection and maintenance; door hardware service life; flooring specification and maintenance; expected component replacement schedule over 50 years.
- Note assumptions where detailed lifecycle data is not yet available.
- Output: Durability/lifecycle strategy narrative for Design Brief (proposal evaluation criterion).

**Step A-6a: Mandatory Interdisciplinary Coordination Meeting**
- **HOLD POINT:** Before proceeding to Step A-7 (Internal Consistency Review), conduct a formal interdisciplinary coordination meeting or structured interface exchange with the teams responsible for dependent deliverables: DEL-02-02 (Firehall Operations), DEL-02-03 (Public Works Operations), DEL-02-05 (HVAC/Mechanical), and DEL-02-07 (Emergency Power).
- Document and resolve key interface agreements: bay layout dimensions, door locations, sump locations and drainage slopes, generator circuit allocation for door secondary mechanisms, roof drainage coordination with civil stormwater, structural coordination items (loading paths, shared column locations), and confirmation that door opening speed requirements are known.
- Purpose: Prevent misalignment proactively during development rather than detecting conflicts after the fact in the consistency review (Step A-7). This is a mandatory coordination practice for the interdisciplinary team.
- Output: Coordination meeting minutes or formal interface register documenting agreements, resolved items, and any outstanding TBDs. Meeting attendance records should include representatives from all dependent deliverable teams.
- [Lensing: X-002]

**Step A-7: Internal Consistency Review**
- Cross-check door schedule against bay layouts (DEL-02-01, DEL-02-02, DEL-02-03).
- Confirm secondary opening mechanism matches DEL-02-07 generator scope.
- Confirm bay slab slopes coordinate with DEL-02-05 sump locations.
- Confirm roof drainage strategy does not conflict with DEL-03-02 site stormwater.
- Confirm interface agreements from Step A-6a coordination meeting are reflected in design documents.
- Flag any unresolved coordination items; log as TBD or ASSUMPTION.
- Output: Reviewed and consistent Design Brief sections for DEL-02-04.

- Finalize envelope assembly details and confirm air/vapour barrier continuity.
- Finalize roof drainage details.
- Finalize door schedule with hardware cut sheets; confirm secondary mechanism design.
- Confirm bay floor slab design with vehicle load assumptions.
- Submit to Owner; record and resolve comments.
- Source: RFP §7.1.8.

**Step B-3: Foundation IFC (if required)**
- If site conditions require early foundation work, issue foundation drawings IFC prior to full building IFC.
- Ensure geotechnical certifications are in place before excavation.
- Source: RFP §7.1.8.

**Step B-4: 100% Detailed Design**
- Complete all structural calculations and drawings; obtain Alberta-registered structural engineer seal.
- Finalize all envelope, roof, door, and flooring specifications.
- Issue for permit application.
- Source: RFP §7.1.8.

**Step B-5: 100% IFC Package**
- Issue full construction document package including all sealed structural drawings, specifications, and schedules.
- Confirm all AHJ permits are in place or applied for.
- Source: RFP §7.1.8.

**Step B-5a: Envelope Assembly Mock-Up / Field Testing**
- Prior to full-scale envelope installation, construct an envelope assembly mock-up or representative wall/roof section for field testing of weather-tightness and air barrier performance.
- Conduct water penetration testing (e.g., ASTM E1105 or equivalent spray test) at the representative section under simulated rain conditions to verify weather-tightness before committing to full installation.
- For a 50-year cold climate building with explicit air/vapour barrier continuity strategy (Step A-3), integrated process coverage should include field verification of: (a) air barrier continuity, (b) vapour barrier placement and continuity, (c) thermal bridging at connections, and (d) condensation risk at junctions.
- **Source:** Best practice for cold climate envelope performance verification aligned with RFP evaluation criterion on durability (RFP §7.1.4).
- **Note:** Scope and extent to be proposed by DB. Recommend field testing at a representative section prior to full building envelope installation. [Lensing: C-004]

**Step B-6: Construction Phase — Structural and Envelope**
- DB Site Superintendent to verify structural work conforms to IFC drawings at key stages: excavation/subgrade, foundation pour, steel erection, envelope installation.
- **HOLD POINT — Geotechnical Certification:** Geotechnical engineer shall provide written sign-off certifying: (a) exposed subgrade conditions, (b) imported material compliance with specifications, and (c) prepared granular base meeting design requirements. **Foundation pour shall not commence without this written geotechnical certification in hand.** This is a gated milestone essential for execution preparedness (R-05). [Lensing: F-003]
- Verify envelope installation against design details and specifications; confirm air/vapour barrier continuity per design basis.
- Source: OSR §10.3.6; RFP §7.3; R-05 (Geotechnical Services).

**Step B-7: Construction Phase — Overhead Doors and Hardware**
- Verify door sizes, hardware grades, and glazing types against approved door schedule prior to installation.
- Test motorized operators; confirm remote control function.
- Test secondary opening mechanism: confirm doors operable manually or on generator power.
- Source: Addendum 03 §1.10, §1.15.

**Step B-8: Construction Phase — Flooring**
- Verify bay floor concrete thickness and reinforcement conform to specification before pour.
- Verify slab slopes to sumps as designed.
- Verify sealer application on shared/office floors; confirm product used is in accordance with specification.
- Source: OSR §10.3.8.

**Step B-9: Commissioning and Closeout**
- Confirm all overhead doors (operators, secondary mechanisms) pass functional testing.
- Confirm no envelope moisture ingress observed.
- Confirm roof drainage functioning correctly.
- Include any outstanding door/envelope items in deficiency list if applicable.
- Source: RFP §7.3.6.

**Step B-10: Post-Occupancy Envelope and Roof Performance Review**
- Schedule a post-occupancy performance review within the warranty period at approximately 1 year post-substantial-completion, after one full seasonal cycle including winter freeze-thaw and spring melt. This timing is critical for a cold climate building where envelope and roof defects commonly manifest after seasonal cycling.
- Comprehensive inspection should address: (a) water ingress at envelope transitions (roof-wall, wall-slab, around penetrations), (b) roof drainage function and any ponding areas, (c) overhead door operational performance (opening speed, wear, hardware condition), (d) floor slab integrity (cracking, settlement, spalling), (e) sealer condition on shared-space floors, and (f) visual assessment of vapour barrier and condensation.
- Document findings in a structured inspection report; identify any defects or warranty claim items requiring contractor correction or warranty action.
- **Purpose:** Many envelope and roof defects in cold climate buildings manifest only after seasonal cycling (first winter snow load and freeze-thaw, first spring melt and rain). A post-occupancy review within the warranty period allows timely identification and correction of defects before the warranty expires.
- **Source:** Best practice for durability/ease of repair evaluation (RFP §7.1.4) in cold climate buildings with 50-year design life. [Lensing: X-004]
