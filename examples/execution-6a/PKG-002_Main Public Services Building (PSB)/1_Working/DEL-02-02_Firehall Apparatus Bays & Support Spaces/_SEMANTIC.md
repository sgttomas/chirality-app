**Intermediate collection:**
- k=1: "principled quality steering" * "justified capability guidance" = substantiated quality direction
- k=2: "substantiated merit delivery" * "demonstrated implementation adequacy" = proven merit sufficiency
- k=3: "settled merit adjudication" * "substantiated performance finding" = validated worth determination
- k=4: "integrated quality inspection" * "substantiated procedural audit" = justified quality examination

L_E = {substantiated quality direction, proven merit sufficiency, validated worth determination, justified quality examination}

**I(evaluative, sufficiency, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * sufficiency = adequate merit

Step 2:
- p1 = adequate merit * substantiated quality direction = sufficient worth steering
- p2 = adequate merit * proven merit sufficiency = demonstrated value adequacy
- p3 = adequate merit * validated worth determination = confirmed merit finding
- p4 = adequate merit * justified quality examination = defensible worth review

Step 3: Centroid of {sufficient worth steering, demonstrated value adequacy, confirmed merit finding, defensible worth review} -> u = "confirmed merit sufficiency"

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=1: "principled quality steering" * "exhaustive stewardship oversight" = total quality governance
- k=2: "substantiated merit delivery" * "exhaustive implementation delivery" = complete value provision
- k=3: "settled merit adjudication" * "exhaustive capability verdict" = comprehensive worth ruling
- k=4: "integrated quality inspection" * "exhaustive procedural review" = total quality audit

L_E = {total quality governance, complete value provision, comprehensive worth ruling, total quality audit}

**I(evaluative, completeness, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = total worth assessment

Step 2:
- p1 = total worth assessment * total quality governance = exhaustive merit authority
- p2 = total worth assessment * complete value provision = full worth delivery
- p3 = total worth assessment * comprehensive worth ruling = thorough merit adjudication
- p4 = total worth assessment * total quality audit = complete value examination

Step 3: Centroid of {exhaustive merit authority, full worth delivery, thorough merit adjudication, complete value examination} -> u = "exhaustive merit fulfillment"

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=1: "principled quality steering" * "unified governance benchmark" = integrated quality benchmark
- k=2: "substantiated merit delivery" * "standardized implementation discipline" = uniform value discipline
- k=3: "settled merit adjudication" * "consistent adjudication standard" = reliable merit benchmark
- k=4: "integrated quality inspection" * "reliable systematic audit" = dependable quality review

L_E = {integrated quality benchmark, uniform value discipline, reliable merit benchmark, dependable quality review}

**I(evaluative, consistency, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = value uniformity

Step 2:
- p1 = value uniformity * integrated quality benchmark = unified merit reference
- p2 = value uniformity * uniform value discipline = standardized worth practice
- p3 = value uniformity * reliable merit benchmark = dependable value standard
- p4 = value uniformity * dependable quality review = trustworthy merit audit

Step 3: Centroid of {unified merit reference, standardized worth practice, dependable value standard, trustworthy merit audit} -> u = "dependable merit benchmark"
