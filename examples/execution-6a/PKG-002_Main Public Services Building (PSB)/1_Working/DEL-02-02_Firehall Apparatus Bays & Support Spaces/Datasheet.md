### Decontamination Area

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Decontamination room area | 150–200 sf (approximate) | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |
| Decontamination shower/WR | 50–60 sf × 2 units | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |

### Gear Storage Spaces

**Terminology note:** "Duty Gear Room" and "bunker gear locker room" are used in source documents with overlapping meaning. Per Guidance Conflict Table CF-0202-02, it is proposed that the Duty Gear Room (350--550 sf) maps to the bunker gear locker room (40 lockers) and Fire Gear Storage (200--350 sf) is a separate space. This mapping is **ASSUMPTION** pending Owner ruling. See also Lensing items B-005, E-001. [Lensing: B-005]

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Bunker gear lockers (quantity) | 40 | Addendum 03 §1.13; SOW-0206 |
| Fire gear storage area | 200–350 sf (approximate) — separate from Duty Gear Room (see terminology note above) | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |
| Duty gear room area (bunker gear locker room) | 350–550 sf (approximate) — proposed mapping: this is the 40-locker bunker gear room (**ASSUMPTION**; see CF-0202-02) | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |
| Gear locker room ventilation | Room-level ventilation required (individual locker ventilation not required) | Addendum 03 §1.14 |

### Additional Support Rooms

| Room | Approximate Area | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SCBA/Cascade Room | 150–200 sf | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |
| Compressor Room | 100–150 sf | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |
| Fire EMS Storage (Med Storage) | 50–70 sf | Functional Program (Appendix B), Addendum 03 §1.21 |
