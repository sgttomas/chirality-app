Add egress requirements or cross-reference to applicable Alberta Building Code provisions for both single-storey and two-storey configurations. REQ-02-01-010 notes "second floor egress planning" as needed but no explicit requirement or verification exists for egress compliance in either configuration. For substantiated regulatory standard, egress must be formally addressed. Source: Alberta Building Code (external -- location TBD). ProposedAuthority: Alberta Building Code. HumanRuling: TBD.
**Verification:** If second storey proposed, floor plans and sections show vertical arrangement; shared-space program confirmed achievable in two-storey configuration; egress compliance demonstrated for chosen configuration (TBD -- pending ABC provisions).

---

### REQ-02-01-011 — Adaptability and Expansion Capability
The building and site design shall demonstrate provisions to minimize cost and disruption of future expansion. The architectural program shall address how the building layout supports future adaptation.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.5; OSR §10.2.1 (Project Success Metrics); SOW-0220
**Merit Traceability [D-003]:** RFP scoring criterion §7.1.5 allocates 15 points for "Adaptability, Flexibility, Potential for Expansion." This requirement maps directly to that evaluation criterion, making merit deployment explicit. Scoring weight: 15 points per RFP.
**Verification:** Expansion concept document submitted; floor plans annotated with potential expansion zones or structural provisions. **Acceptance Criteria [X-002]:** Define measurable acceptance criteria for expansion concept review (e.g., minimum two expansion scenarios addressed; structural bay grid provisions confirmed; preliminary cost-of-expansion estimate provided vs. cost of alternative site expansion). Verify these criteria provide objective, verifiable evidence of credible expansion planning. ProposedAuthority: Design-Builder (Architect). HumanRuling: TBD.

---

### REQ-02-01-012 — Program Dimension Flexibility

**Source:** Addendum 01 §1.2; SOW-0600
**Verification:** Room data sheets confirm each space meets or exceeds applicable building code minimums.

---

### REQ-02-01-013 — Professional Seals
All planning, design, and construction documents, including the architectural program and drawings, must be sealed by an Architect registered to practice in Alberta.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Quality Management)
**Note [A-002]:** TBD -- Clarify whether professional seal is required at proposal stage or only at design milestones. The timing assumption affects whether proposal-stage documents must carry seals. Ambiguity could cause non-compliance if proposal submissions require seals and they are omitted. ProposedAuthority: RFP Section 7.2; Architects Act (Alberta). HumanRuling: TBD.
**Verification:** Proposal drawings and narratives carry Alberta Architect's seal where required by the Architects Act (Alberta). ASSUMPTION: full sealed set required at design milestone stages, not necessarily at proposal stage.
