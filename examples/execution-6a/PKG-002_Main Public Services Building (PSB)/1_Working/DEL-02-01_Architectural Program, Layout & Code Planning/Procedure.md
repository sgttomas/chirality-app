# Procedure: DEL-02-01 Architectural Program, Layout & Code Planning

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps to produce the Architectural Program, Layout & Code Planning deliverable package for the Town of Penhold PSB proposal. It covers the process from initial source review through submission-ready documents, and identifies the key verification checks that confirm each step has been completed adequately.

A secondary purpose is to describe how this document set transitions into the design phase after contract award — that is, how the proposal-stage architectural program is carried forward and refined through design development.

## Prerequisites

### Information Required Before Starting

**NOTE [A-004]:** TBD -- Confirm location and accessibility of Functional Program (Appendix B) before Step A-2 can proceed. The Functional Program is listed as "location TBD" across all four documents and governs the room list and areas, making it a blocking prerequisite for procedural direction. Source: RFP Appendix B. ProposedAuthority: RFP Appendix B. HumanRuling: TBD.

| Input | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RFP 2024_004 (including OSR Appendix A, Appendix B Functional Program) | OSR §10.2 confirmed accessible; Functional Program (Appendix B) — **location TBD; BLOCKING prerequisite [A-004]** -- obtain and confirm accessible before proceeding to Step A-2 | _Sources/AB-2024-07156-Penhold Public Services Building RFP_2024_004.pdf |
| Addendum 01, 02, 03 | Addendum 03 confirmed accessible; Addenda 01–02 — partially reviewed; read all before finalizing program | _Sources/ |
| Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) | Available in _Sources/references/ — read for site constraints affecting floor elevations and layout | _Sources/references/AB-2024-07156-Penhold PSB_Geotechnical Investigation Report.pdf |
| Site Grading drawings (Appendix E) | Available in _Sources/references/ — read for preferred building location/orientation | _Sources/references/AB-2024-07156-Penhold PSB_Site grading.pdf |
| Alberta Building Code | External — not directly accessible in this run; obtain current Alberta Building Code before completing accessibility plan. **[A-003]** Without the ABC text, compliance determination for accessibility (REQ-02-01-006) and occupancy classification confirmation cannot be completed. | External reference |
| Decomposition (deliverable scope) | Confirmed accessible | _Decomposition/Penhold_PSB_Project_Decomposition_FINAL_v1.0_PHASE7.md |

### Upstream Coordination (no formal upstream declarations, but functional dependencies)
- No upstream dependencies formally declared in _DEPENDENCIES.md.
- **[C-003] FORMAL COORDINATION REQUIREMENT:** A site plan concept (coordinate with DEL-03-01 civil team) is required to confirm building footprint before finalizing floor plan layouts. The building footprint cannot be confirmed without site plan coordination (DEL-03-01). This is a blocking prerequisite for Step A-3.
- **[F-002] STRUCTURAL COORDINATION REQUIREMENT:** Structural bay grid preferences (from DEL-02-04 structural lead) must be coordinated early in Step A-3, as structural grid drives floor plan efficiency and expansion capability (Guidance P-6). Confirm bay grid dimensions and expansion grid provisions as required input to building layout development.

## Steps

### Phase A — Proposal Production (Design-Builder's Proposal Submission)

**Step A-1: Review and Confirm Source Documents**
- Read OSR §10.2 (Appendix A) in full for building program and functional requirements.
- Read Functional Program (Appendix B) — obtain and review full room list, dimensions, and adjacency notes.
- Read Addendum 01 (§1.2 — program dimension flexibility), Addendum 02, and Addendum 03 (all clauses relevant to main building).
- Record any conflicts between OSR and Addenda; apply Addendum direction where it supersedes OSR (per RFP §2.9).
- Review room sizing table in Addendum 03 §1.21 as guidance reference.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.1; RFP §2.9

---

**Step A-2: Establish Architectural Program (Room Data)**
- Develop a room list derived from Functional Program (Appendix B) and OSR §10.2.
- For each room, confirm:
  - Name / function
  - Approximate area (Functional Program governs; Addendum 03 §1.21 ranges for selected rooms)
  - Occupancy / user group (Fire, Public Works, shared)
  - Key adjacency requirements
  - Special functional requirements (ventilation, flooring type, fixture count, etc.)
- Confirm 40 bunker gear lockers in gear locker room; confirm room size accommodates lockers plus circulation.
- Confirm 40-person kitchen/breakroom.
- Confirm meeting room accommodates 40 people and 15 emergency management workstations.
- Note program items intentionally left open for DB design flexibility (SOW-0600).

**Verification check (A-2):** Room list covers all spaces identified in OSR §10.2 and Functional Program; no programmatic gaps.

---

**Step A-3: Develop Building Layout (Conceptual Floor Plans)**
- **[F-002] Explicit Coordination Step — Obtain Structural Grid Input:** Before developing the building layout, conduct a formal coordination meeting with the structural lead (DEL-02-04). Obtain and document:
  - Preferred bay grid dimensions (e.g., 20' × 30', 24' × 30', or other module)
  - Expansion grid alignment (structural bay continuations to support future bay additions)
  - Vertical framing preferences (beam sizes, column locations that may constrain ceiling heights or create obstacles)
  - Floor-to-floor height constraints (affects building profile and multi-storey feasibility)

  Structural grid drives floor plan efficiency and expansion capability (Guidance P-6). Document coordination in a coordination memo or design notes. Include these preferences as required input to Step A-3 layout development. Source: Guidance P-6; _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-002. ProposedAuthority: Design-Builder (PM); DEL-02-04 lead. HumanRuling: TBD.

- Develop a conceptual building layout showing:
  - Fire Department zone (apparatus bays, decontamination, gear/support spaces)
  - Public Works zone (shop bays, workshop, PPE/locker, offices)
  - Shared zone (kitchen, meeting/training, offices, washrooms, IT/utility)
  - Clear circulation paths between zones
  - Vehicle access points (drive-through bay entries aligned with site plan)
- Confirm building fits within the preferred building location shown in Site Grading drawings (Appendix E / Addendum 03 §1.20).
- Decide: single-storey or two-storey configuration for shared spaces?
  - If two-storey: develop section showing vertical arrangement; confirm egress requirements.
  - If single-storey: confirm ground floor footprint is feasible within site constraints.
- Dimension floor plans to indicate building size (RFP §7.1.1).
- Produce building sections (minimum one longitudinal, one transverse).

**Verification check (A-3):** Floor plans show all programmatic zones; drive-through bays shown as drive-through (not dead-end); sections show floor-to-floor heights or floor-to-roof heights; structural grid coordination documented.

---

**[D-002] Internal Design Review Gate (after Step A-3, before Step A-4)**
Before proceeding to accessibility planning (A-4) and subsequent steps, conduct an internal design review of the Step A-3 layout output. This checkpoint **[D-002]** confirms:
- All programmatic zones are placed and dimensioned appropriately
- Structural grid coordination (F-002) is confirmed and documented in layout
- Site plan coordination (C-003) is confirmed and building footprint aligns with civil DEL-03-01 concept
- The chosen single-storey or two-storey configuration is documented with rationale
- No major program gaps exist before investing effort in accessibility, ceiling, and expansion narratives

**Design Review Participants (TBD detail level):** At minimum, lead architect and PM should sign off. Optional: structural and civil leads if available during proposal stage.
**Documentation:** Maintain a design review checklist or gate sign-off memo confirming above points before proceeding to Step A-4.

---

**Step A-4: Develop Accessibility Plan**
- Identify occupancy classification(s) under Alberta Building Code.
- Determine applicable Alberta Building Code accessibility requirements for each occupancy.
- Mark accessible routes, accessible entry/entries, accessible washrooms, and accessible parking (if applicable) on floor plans.
- Prepare accessibility narrative (RFP §7.1.3) describing how key Alberta Building Code accessibility elements are accommodated.
- If any element cannot be confirmed without further code analysis, note as TBD and flag for Building Design Development stage.

**Verification check (A-4):** Accessibility narrative submitted with proposal; accessible elements identified on floor plan.

---

**Step A-5: Develop Ceiling Approach Narrative**
- Determine ceiling approach by zone:
  - Apparatus bays / shop bays: exposed structure is typical — confirm if acceptable given durability, code, and cleanability requirements.
  - Decontamination / operational support spaces: consider cleanability; avoid finishes that trap contaminants.
  - Shared spaces (offices, meeting room, kitchen): consider acoustic performance and cleanability.
- Prepare written narrative describing proposed ceiling type(s), rationale for selection by zone, and how durability/maintenance/acoustic/code requirements are met.
- Note open issue (SOW-0218): confirm with Owner during design if specific acoustic or cleanability requirements apply.

**Verification check (A-5):** Ceiling approach narrative covers all major zones; rationale given for each zone.

---

**Step A-6: Develop Expansion / Two-Storey Concept**
- Prepare a written concept and/or sketch illustrating:
  - How the building layout accommodates future expansion (e.g., bay additions, building extensions)
  - What structural or site provisions are included to minimize disruption of future expansion
  - If two-storey proposed: how second-storey shared spaces preserve ground-level expansion potential
- Reference RFP §7.1.5 scoring criterion (15 points for "Adaptability, Flexibility, Potential for Expansion").

**Verification check (A-6):** Expansion concept document references at least one credible expansion scenario; shows site or building provisions.

---

**Step A-7: Assemble Deliverable Package**
- Compile all artifacts:
  - Floor plans / sections (dimensioned)
  - Room data sheets (or room list table)
  - Accessibility plan/narrative
  - Ceiling approach narrative
  - Expansion/2-storey concept
- Confirm drawings are in PDF format (under 15 MB total proposal limit per RFP §4.2 — note this applies to overall proposal).
- Verify professional Architect's seal is applied where required.
- Cross-check against Specification requirements (REQ-02-01-001 through REQ-02-01-013).

**Verification check (A-7):** All required artifacts present; Specification requirements addressed; seal confirmed.

---

### Phase B — Design Development (Post-Award Implementation)

**Step B-1: Owner Review and Acceptance of Architectural Program**
- **[E-002] Owner Acceptance Checkpoint:** At Building Design Development stage (prior to proceeding to detailed design), present the architectural program to the Owner/Project Committee for formal review and acceptance.
- Review the following elements with Owner/Project Committee:
  - Floor plans and spatial organization (Fire zone, Public Works zone, shared zone layout)
  - Room sizes, adjacencies, and functional program finalization
  - Chosen configuration (single-storey vs. two-storey for shared spaces)
  - Accessibility approach and any early code compliance findings
  - Preliminary ceiling, flooring, and mechanical routing strategies
  - Expansion provisions and future growth planning
- Document Owner feedback and program adjustments.
- Obtain formal Owner/Project Committee sign-off confirming the architectural program is acceptable before design team proceeds to detailed design phases.
- Update room data sheets and floor plans as needed based on Owner input.

Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md E-002 (Exhaustive Worth Actualization); Specification verification table [E-002]. ProposedAuthority: Owner / Project Committee. HumanRuling: TBD.

**Step B-2: Coordinate with Discipline Leads**
- Coordinate floor plan layouts with:
  - Structural lead (DEL-02-04): confirm structural grid, bay dimensions, expansion provisions.
  - Mechanical lead (DEL-02-05): confirm bay exhaust routing, HVAC distribution zones.
  - Electrical/IT lead (DEL-02-06): confirm meeting room workstation layout, server/IT room location.
  - Civil lead (DEL-03-01): confirm building siting, grading, vehicle access.
- Issue coordination drawing set at each design milestone (60% DD, 100% DD).

**Step B-3: Obtain Building Permit**
- Prepare architectural drawings to permit standard.
- Coordinate permit application with permitting lead (DEL-01-04).
- Respond to AHJ comments affecting architectural program or layout.

**Step B-4: Finalize IFC Architectural Documents**
- Issue 100% IFC architectural drawings.
- Confirm all code compliance items (accessibility, egress, occupancy) are satisfied per AHJ review.
- Seal all documents per Alberta Architects Act requirements.
