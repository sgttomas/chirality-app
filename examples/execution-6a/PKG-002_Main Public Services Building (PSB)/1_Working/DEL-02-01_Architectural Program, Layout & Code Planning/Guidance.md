# Guidance: DEL-02-01 Architectural Program, Layout & Code Planning

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to establish the foundational spatial organization and code compliance framework for the main Public Services Building (PSB). It is the primary architectural response to the Owner's Statement of Requirements and Functional Program, translating programmatic intent into a coherent floor plan, space program, and code strategy that downstream PKG-002 deliverables (structure, envelope, MEP, electrical) can build upon.

The Owner's intent is a turnkey, 50-year-life municipal operations facility integrating the Fire Department and Public Works Operations into one building, with shared spaces that eliminate duplication of facilities such as break rooms and office space. The architectural program is where that integration is first made spatial.

## Principles

### P-1: Integration First, Separation by Function
The building combines three distinct user groups (Fire Department, Public Works, shared staff). The architectural layout must make integration work operationally — shared spaces must be genuinely accessible to both groups — while maintaining functional separation where operations require it (e.g., decontamination from office circulation; apparatus bay exhaust from occupied spaces).

**Source:** OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36); OSR §10.2.1 (Project Success Metrics)

---

### P-2: Design for the Operations Reality
The building is primarily used by volunteer firefighters and public works crew members, not office workers. The layout must support:
- Safe pedestrian and vehicle access
- Efficient maneuverability for loading, unloading, and operating heavy equipment
- Practical housekeeping of operational spaces (mud, dust, snow melt — hence sealed concrete flooring)

**Source:** OSR §10.3.4 (Project Design, RFP p.39); OSR §10.3.8; Addendum 03 §1.3

---

### P-3: Program Flexibility Is Intentional
The Functional Program (Appendix B) intentionally leaves certain space dimensions open. The Design-Builder should treat this as design latitude — not an incomplete specification. Spaces must meet building code minimums and the functional intent, but the DB is encouraged to find cost-effective configurations. Apparatus bay and workshop bay ranges (2,000–2,200 ft² each) are the most constrained by equipment requirements.

**Source:** Addendum 01 §1.2; SOW-0600; Addendum 03 §1.21

---

### P-4: Accessibility Is Code-Minimum, Not an Afterthought
The Alberta Building Code accessibility requirements apply. The accessibility plan should be developed early in design to avoid costly retrofits. Key areas to address: accessible entrance(s), accessible washrooms, accessible route through shared spaces, accessible parking (if applicable). The specific ABC provisions that apply will depend on occupancy classification — this should be resolved at the Building Design Development stage.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.3; SOW-0219; Alberta Building Code (external — location TBD)

---

### P-5: Ceiling System Is a Design Decision, Not a Default
The Owner explicitly did not prescribe a ceiling system (Addendum 03 §1.3). The DB should approach this as a genuine design choice that balances:
- Durability and ease of replacement in operational areas
- Acoustic performance in shared spaces (meeting room, offices, breakroom)
- Cost (exposed structure vs. acoustic tile vs. gypsum board)
- Cleanability in decontamination and operational zones
- Code compliance (fire rating, if required by occupancy)

The ceiling narrative should explain the rationale for the proposed approach by zone, not apply a single solution building-wide without justification.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.3; SOW-0218; Open Issue: confirm acoustic/cleanability expectations with Owner during design

---

### P-6: Design for Expansion From Day One
The Owner explicitly values adaptability and future expansion capability (RFP §7.1.5). Operationally, the Town will grow — the PSB must accommodate both departments' growth over a 50-year horizon. The layout should:
- Avoid dead-end configurations that prevent future bay additions
- Prefer structural bays/grids that allow phased extension
- Consider 2-storey shared spaces as a means to preserve ground-floor expansion area for operational uses

## Considerations

### C-1: Two-Storey vs. Single-Storey Trade-off
The Owner confirmed a second storey is acceptable for shared spaces (Addendum 03 §1.5). This creates a genuine trade-off:

| Dimension | Single-Storey | Two-Storey (shared spaces) |
|---|---|---|
| Initial construction cost | Generally lower per sf for industrial-type buildings | Higher per sf for occupied floor plate |
| Ground floor expansion potential | Less ground floor available if shared spaces occupy it; bay expansion constrained | More ground floor available for future bay expansion |
| Structural complexity | Simpler | Requires separate structural framing above |
| Emergency egress | Simpler | Second floor egress planning needed |
| Operational circulation | All on one level (convenient for operational users) | Staff moving between floors (minor inconvenience) |
| Lifecycle cost basis (50-year horizon) | Single-floor HVAC may be simpler; less expansion disruption if ground bays expand | Two-storey allows more phased ground expansion; elevator/vertical circulation adds maintenance; full lifecycle cost analysis recommended |

**Lifecycle Cost Consideration Framework [F-003]:**
A two-storey configuration for shared spaces may be cost-advantageous on a total lifecycle basis (expanded ground floor capacity for operational expansion) but adds initial construction cost. The Design-Builder should evaluate both options and present a lifecycle cost comparison addressing:
- **(a) Initial construction cost differential** — cost premium or savings for two-storey vs. single-storey
- **(b) Long-term expansion cost avoidance** — estimated savings if future bays can be added/extended at lower cost due to preserved ground floor
- **(c) Operational cost differences over 50-year horizon** — elevator maintenance, HVAC zoning, vertical transportation, increased cleanability effort in multi-level facility
- **(d) 50-year NPV comparison** — discounted present value of all construction and operational costs for each option, using Owner-specified discount rate

**Source:** RFP §2.2 (Background); OSR §10.2.1 (Project Success Metrics — 50-year design life); Guidance P-6 (Design for Expansion From Day One).
**ASSUMPTION:** The DB should evaluate and present the chosen approach clearly, with preliminary lifecycle cost basis if the two-storey option is elected at proposal stage. Detailed cost analysis can be refined post-award during design development.

**NOTE [F-003]:** Warrant for lifecycle framework added per _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md F-003; comprehensive worth mastery requires lifecycle evaluation framework. Source: Guidance C-1: Two-Storey vs. Single-Storey Trade-off. ProposedAuthority: Design-Builder (cost estimator). HumanRuling: TBD.

### C-2: Meeting Room as Incident Command Post
The meeting/training room (40 people, 15 emergency management workstations) doubles as an Incident Command Post. This has layout implications:
- Backup generator must supply this room (REQ-02-01-004; DEL-02-07)
- Room must have appropriate network connectivity (DEL-02-06)
- Location should allow access from both Fire and Public Works zones without passing through operational bay areas if possible

**Source:** OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36); Addendum 03 §1.15; SOW-0208

---

### C-3: Bunker Gear Locker Room Sizing
40 bunker gear lockers are required (Addendum 03 §1.13 and §1.21). The locker room must be sized to fit 40 lockers with room for firefighters to access and maneuver in full gear. The 200–350 ft² range from Addendum 03 §1.21 refers to Fire Gear Storage (not the bunker gear locker room explicitly — the gear locker room will need to be larger than this to accommodate 40 lockers plus circulation). This is an open interpretation point — the DB should confirm sizing logic.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.13; §1.21
**ASSUMPTION:** The 200–350 ft² range in Addendum 03 §1.21 for "Fire Gear Storage" may be separate from the bunker gear locker room. The bunker gear locker room sizing should be determined by equipment and clearance requirements (40 lockers + aisle space).

---

### C-4: Decontamination Zone Placement
The decontamination area (washrooms, shower, fire gear lockers, equipment storage, breathing air compressor, medical storage) should be located between the apparatus bay zone and the office/shared area zone to allow proper decontamination flow before entry into clean shared spaces. This is an architectural planning principle for fire stations.

**Source:** OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36); SOW-0205
**ASSUMPTION:** Decontamination adjacency to apparatus bays is standard fire station planning practice; OSR does not prescribe specific layout but states "access to office/shared areas" from decon zone.

---

### C-5: Code Signage Coordination
Code-required signage (egress, occupancy, accessibility) is in base scope; Town branding is an optional item. The architectural program should identify signage zones and requirements early to avoid late coordination with the signage optional priced item.

**Source:** OSR §10.3.11; §12.5; SOW-0229

---

### C-6: CCDC 14-2013 Contract Form Implications [D-001]
The project is governed by CCDC 14-2013 (Design-Build Stipulated Price Contract), referenced in RFP §5.4. This contract form shapes the architectural deliverable obligations in several ways:
- **Design milestone definitions:** CCDC 14-2013 defines standard design submission stages (e.g., Schematic Design, Design Development, Contract Documents) which govern when architectural program documents must be submitted and reviewed.
- **Document submission obligations:** The DB is responsible for all design documents under this contract form; the Owner reviews but does not direct design. Architectural program deliverables must align with the contract's definition of what constitutes each design stage.
- **Quality responsibility:** Under CCDC 14-2013, the DB carries full responsibility for design quality, including code compliance, professional sealing, and adherence to design standards (e.g., NMS format if required).

**Context for this Deliverable:** This architectural program (DEL-02-01) is a proposal-stage deliverable. If selected, it transitions into design development post-award. The Procedure (Steps B-1 onwards) describes the refinement process that occurs after contract award, aligned with CCDC 14-2013 milestone structure.

**NOTE [D-001]:** TBD -- Clarify the specific CCDC 14-2013 milestone definitions and submission requirements applicable to this architectural program deliverable. Recommend confirming at contract negotiations or in the detailed design protocol. The contract form text was not directly accessible in this run. Source: RFP §5.4; CCDC 14-2013 (external -- location TBD). ProposedAuthority: RFP Section 5.4. HumanRuling: TBD.

**ASSUMPTION:** The milestone names used in the Specification Verification table (Building Design Development, 60% Detailed Design, 100% Detailed Design) are provisional and should be reconciled with CCDC 14-2013 actual stage definitions at contract execution.

---

### C-7: NMS Format — Mandatory or Recommended [C-002]
The Specification Standards table lists National Master Specification (NMS) as the document format standard, noted as "Recommended format per RFP §7.2." The mandatory/optional status has rationale implications:
- If NMS is **mandatory**, all specification sections for this deliverable must conform to NMS format, and format non-compliance is a rejection criterion.
- If NMS is **recommended**, the DB may use alternative specification formats (e.g., CSI MasterFormat) provided they meet the Owner's documentation quality expectations.

TBD -- Confirm whether RFP §7.2 intends NMS as a mandatory requirement or a preference. The distinction affects specification preparation effort and compliance verification scope.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Quality Management); Specification Standards table (NMS row)
**ASSUMPTION:** NMS is treated as recommended (not mandatory) unless the Owner or RFP explicitly requires it. ProposedAuthority: RFP Section 7.2. HumanRuling: TBD.

---

### C-5: Code Signage Coordination
Code-required signage (egress, occupancy, accessibility) is in base scope; Town branding is an optional item. The architectural program should identify signage zones and requirements early to avoid late coordination with the signage optional priced item.

**Source:** OSR §10.3.11; §12.5; SOW-0229

## Trade-offs

### T-1: Program Completeness vs. Design Flexibility
The Functional Program (Appendix B) is the detailed room-list source, but it was not directly accessible in this run (location TBD). The architectural program must be developed with the Functional Program in hand. If Functional Program room areas are smaller than Addendum 03 sample ranges, the DB should flag this as a potential design assumption for Owner review.

**ASSUMPTION:** Room sizes from Addendum 03 §1.21 are sample ranges only; Functional Program (Appendix B) governs unless it conflicts with Addendum 03 clarifications, in which case the more specific Addendum 03 direction applies (per RFP §2.9 — Addenda form part of contract documents).

---

### T-2: Ceiling System Cost vs. Performance
An exposed structural ceiling (no finish) is lowest cost in bay areas but may not be appropriate in shared spaces for acoustic or aesthetic reasons. An acoustic tile ceiling in shared spaces is mid-cost and high-performing acoustically, but requires consideration of cleanability in decontamination areas. The DB must balance cost (capital and lifecycle) against the Owner's durability/maintenance expectations.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.3; SOW-0218

---

### T-3: Accessibility vs. Operational Layout
Placing accessible routes through an industrial operations facility can conflict with efficient layout (e.g., grade changes between bay slabs and office floor levels). The DB should resolve accessible entry and route requirements early to avoid costly ramps or lifts being retrofitted.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.3; SOW-0219; Alberta Building Code (external — location TBD)

## Examples

Examples of successful approaches are TBD pending review of the Functional Program (Appendix B) and any comparable municipal operations facility precedents the Design-Builder may reference. No specific examples are available from accessible sources at this stage.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

The following conflicts and ambiguities require human resolution:

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-02-01-001 | Bunker gear locker room size range (200–350 ft² in Addendum 03 §1.21 listed as "Fire Gear Storage") may not reflect the actual size needed for 40 bunker gear lockers plus circulation. **[B-004]** Confirmed: the data inconsistency between "Fire Gear Storage" area range and the 40-locker requirement could lead to undersized space if taken at face value. | Addendum 03 §1.21 (Fire Gear Storage: 200–350 ft²) | Addendum 03 §1.13 (40 bunker gear lockers required) | Specification REQ-02-01-004; Datasheet Space Program (Fire Gear Storage row); Guidance C-3 | Addendum 03 §1.21 is guidance only; DB to size per 40-locker + circulation requirement and confirm with Owner | TBD |
| CONF-02-01-002 | Occupancy classification (Assembly / business / industrial) is TBD, but it drives code-minimum room sizes, egress widths, and accessibility provisions under Alberta Building Code. **[A-001, C-001, F-001]** Multiple downstream requirements (REQ-02-01-006, REQ-02-01-012) cannot be finalized until classification is confirmed with AHJ. | Datasheet: Occupancy type (ASSUMPTION) | Alberta Building Code (external -- not accessible) | Specification REQ-02-01-006, REQ-02-01-012; Verification table; Procedure Step A-4 | Alberta Building Code + AHJ confirmation required | TBD |
| CONF-02-01-003 | Professional seal timing: ASSUMPTION states full sealed set required at design milestone stages, not necessarily at proposal stage. **[A-002]** If proposal-stage documents require seals and they are omitted, non-compliance could result. | RFP §7.2 (Quality Management) | Architects Act (Alberta) -- not directly accessible | Specification REQ-02-01-013; Procedure Step A-7 | RFP Section 7.2; Architects Act (Alberta) | TBD |
