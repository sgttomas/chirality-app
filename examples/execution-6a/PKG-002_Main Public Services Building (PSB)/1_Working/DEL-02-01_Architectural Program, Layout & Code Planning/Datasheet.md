## Attributes

### Building Program Overview

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Building type | Integrated Municipal Public Services Facility (Fire + Public Works + shared spaces) | OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36) |
| Design life — main building | Minimum 50 years | OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36) |
| Design life — ancillary buildings | 20 years | OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36) |
| Configuration option | Single-storey or two-storey (DB to propose; second storey acceptable for shared spaces) | Addendum 03 §1.5 |
| Occupancy type | Assembly / business / industrial (fire and public works municipal operations) | ASSUMPTION: classification per Alberta Building Code; exact classification TBD at design. **CRITICAL [A-001 / CONF-02-01-002]:** Occupancy classification (Assembly / business / industrial) drives code-minimum room sizes, egress widths, and accessibility provisions under Alberta Building Code. Classification must be confirmed with AHJ before downstream prescriptive requirements (REQ-02-01-006, REQ-02-01-012) can be finalized. This is a foundational requirement affecting multiple downstream deliverables. Confirm at Building Design Development stage or earlier. ProposedAuthority: Alberta Building Code + AHJ. HumanRuling: TBD |
| Total program areas | TBD (Functional Program Appendix B not directly accessible; sample ranges in Addendum 03 §1.21). **NOTE [B-001]:** Total building program area (aggregate ft2) is an essential fact for building sizing and layout verification. To be populated once Functional Program (Appendix B) is reviewed. Source: Functional Program (Appendix B) — location TBD | Addendum 03 §1.21; Functional Program (Appendix B) — location TBD |
