# Guidance: DEL-02-03 Public Works Shop Bays, Workshop & Support Spaces

## Purpose

DEL-02-03 exists to demonstrate that the Design-Builder has understood and addressed the operational requirements of the Public Works (PW) function within the PSB. The PW shop side is a heavy equipment maintenance and operations core — it must safely accommodate large vehicles (including graders), provide practical workshop/storage workflow, and support 40 staff through purpose-designed locker, PPE, and office support spaces.

This deliverable supports OBJ-003: "Provide operationally functional Public Works facilities, including PPE/lockers, offices, and drive-through shop bays with maintenance/workshop capability."

The evaluator is looking for evidence that the Design-Builder has gone beyond code minimum and proposed a layout that actually works for daily PW operations — not a generic industrial bay arrangement.

---

## Principles

### P1: Size for the Actual Fleet, Not a Generic "Heavy Bay"
The PW equipment list (Functional Program, RFP pp.47-48) is specific. The sizing driver is two graders per bay (John Deere GP770: 30' long, 14' moldboard width, 23'8" minimum turning radius). Bay width and clear height must be validated against this — not assumed from generic industrial design tables.

**Source:** Functional Program Equipment List (RFP pp.47-48); OSR §10.2; Addendum 03 §1.21

### P2: Drive-Through Bays Are Operationally Essential
Drive-through configuration (enter one end, exit the other) is an explicit Owner requirement. This eliminates the need for equipment to reverse out of bays — a significant operational safety and efficiency consideration for large graders and dump trucks.

**Source:** OSR §10.2 (RFP p.36); SOW-0211

### P3: Ventilation Is Contextual, Not Code-Minimum
Addendum 03 §1.11 clarifies that PW bay ventilation is for occasional short-term idling and very occasional welding — not continuous heavy-duty fume extraction. This distinguishes the PW bays from the fire apparatus bays (which require dedicated direct exhaust systems). The ventilation solution should be proportionate to the intermittent use pattern. A dedicated welding bay is not required unless the Design-Builder proposes one as a value-add.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.11; SOW-0213

### P4: The Shop Program Is a Workflow System, Not a Collection of Rooms
The Functional Program identifies a sequence of interdependent spaces: warm storage warehouse (enclosed) → workspace/storage bay (half welding/maintenance, half parts storage) → shop first aid/PPE room → shop office → shop washroom. The layout should reflect a logical workflow — staff arriving from locker room, proceeding to PPE, accessing bays, and being able to reach the office and washroom without crossing the bay vehicle zone.

**Source:** Functional Program (Appendix B) Rows 22.0–28.0; OSR §10.2

### P5: The Locker Room Must Be Sized for 40 Now and Expandable to 50
Current PW staff is 20; future maximum is 50 (OSR §10.3.5). The locker room requirement is 40 lockers (current target). The layout should not be so tight that expansion to 50 is structurally impractical.

**Expansion trigger (A-001):** The proposal-stage documents do not specify a prescriptive threshold or decision point that triggers expansion from 40 to 50 lockers. Design-Builder should propose and document the expansion path (e.g., occupancy % reaching 80%, or a staffing milestone such as "when FTE count reaches 35"). The expansion zone (space for 10 additional lockers, ~120–150 sf) should be explicitly shown on the locker room layout, with dimensional and structural feasibility notes. TBD — confirm with Owner what staffing/occupancy threshold justifies expansion investment.

### P6: Sealed Concrete Is the Required and Preferred Floor Finish
The Owner has specified sealed concrete for bay and shop areas. This is not a design option subject to substitution — it is the Owner's stated preference and meets the operational need for mud/dust cleanability. Aprons at all overhead doors are also required.

**Durability rationale (D-002):** The selection of sealed concrete aligns with the 50-year building life requirement (OSR §10.2; REQ-2303-18). Sealed concrete in a heavy-equipment maintenance environment provides: (a) resistance to abrasion from tracked/wheeled equipment, (b) chemical resistance to de-icing salts, hydraulic fluids, and petroleum products, (c) ease of repair through re-sealing at periodic intervals, and (d) low lifecycle maintenance cost relative to alternative finishes.

**Maintenance implications:** A periodic re-sealing maintenance cycle (typical industrial practice: 5–10 year intervals depending on traffic intensity) should be assumed when evaluating 50-year lifecycle cost. The Design-Builder should specify sealant type and application method with reference to the 50-year design life. The proposal narrative should document the assumed maintenance regime (e.g., "sealed concrete with industrial-grade epoxy or urethane sealant, re-applied every 7 years") so that the Owner understands the lifecycle cost commitment. Post-award, a maintenance plan specifying the re-sealing interval and procedure should be documented as part of the building operations/maintenance manual.

### P7: Air Lines Are Operational Infrastructure, Not Optional Fit-Out
The Functional Program shows air lines hard-plumbed through bays and the workspace/storage area. This is an operational necessity for equipment maintenance (tire inflation, pneumatic tools, air-powered jacks). The layout must integrate compressed air outlet locations at intervals appropriate to bay use patterns.

## Considerations

### C1: Optional Wash Bay Impacts Bay Count
If the Owner selects the built-in wash bay option (SOW-0500, OSR §12.1), it may replace the fourth PW bay. The base design shows four bays. However, the layout should be documented so that a wash bay substitution in bay four is structurally and plumbing-wise feasible without requiring major redesign elsewhere. This avoids a costly change-order scenario if the option is exercised.

**Source:** OSR §12.1 (RFP p.44); Addendum 03 §1.9; SOW-0500

### C2: Structural Clear Height Is Controlled by the Tallest Equipment at Its Operational Height
The equipment list includes a street sweeper (Elgin/Nissan Eagle/3300) with hopper raised to 22' tall. Bay structural height must accommodate this. The 16' overhead door minimum is a floor-to-door-opening figure — the structural clear height above (roof structure, lights, air lines) must not impinge on operational clearances. ASSUMPTION: a structural clear height of 22–24 ft is a likely range; to be confirmed by Structural lead.

**Source:** Functional Program Equipment List (RFP p.48); OSR §10.3.9 (RFP p.41)

### C3: Interdisciplinary Interfaces Require Explicit Coordination
This deliverable's layouts create the spatial framework that DEL-02-04 (structure/envelope/doors), DEL-02-05 (mechanical/plumbing/ventilation/sumps), and DEL-02-06 (electrical/lighting) must work within. Layout decisions made here have direct cost and coordination consequences for those deliverables. Early coordination on bay width, structural bay spacing, and overhead door quantity is essential.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION based on multi-discipline integration requirements stated in _CONTEXT.md

### C4: PW Staff Facilities Must Match Scale of Use
The locker room with 40 lockers and 2 showers is sized for the current staff contingent of up to 40. The design should verify that washroom fixture counts meet Alberta Building Code requirements for the occupancy load. The Functional Program specifies 2 standalone showers — these are separate from the washrooms for after-work cleanup, not emergency decontamination (which is a Fire Department requirement in DEL-02-02).

**Source:** Functional Program Row 22.0; OSR §10.2; SOW-0219

### C5: Workshop Area Split Function
The workspace/storage bay (Functional Program Row 28.0) is described as "half of bay for welding/maintenance of vehicles; half of bay for storage/parts." This dual-use character requires the layout to enable both functions simultaneously without one interfering with the other. Separation or sequencing strategy is an ASSUMPTION — the Design-Builder should propose an approach in the workshop concept.

**Dimensional guidance (B-003):** The "half and half" split should not be interpreted as a simple 50/50 area allocation. Instead, propose specific minimum dimensional targets for each zone based on functional requirements:
- **Welding/maintenance zone:** minimum area/dimensions sufficient to accommodate one complete grader (approximately 30' length × 8–10' width for vehicle positioning + 4–5' operator circulation on both sides = ~400–500 sf minimum). Should provide adequate clearance for welding gun operation, fuel fill-up, and post-wash movement.
- **Parts storage zone:** minimum area for shelving racks, palletized equipment storage, and aisle access for pallet jack/forklift movement (typically 30–40% of bay area for efficient storage access).

Document the assumed minimum dimensions for each zone in the workshop concept narrative. Layout should identify the physical separation strategy (e.g., movable partition, fixed wall segment, or operational sequence).

**Source:** Functional Program Row 28.0; SOW-0212; REQ-2303-10, REQ-2303-11

### C7: Vehicle Fluid Containment Provisions (C-003)
Bay sumps address snow melt and minor washing (Addendum 03 §1.8), but no source document explicitly addresses fluid containment for maintenance activities (oil changes, hydraulic fluid handling, fuel management) that are inherent to the shop bay operational function. The Design-Builder must consider whether PW bays and workshop areas require secondary containment provisions beyond the snow-melt sump design.

**Scope of concern:** Vehicle maintenance in the shop bays and workshop areas will generate:
- Oil/hydraulic fluid drips during servicing (oil changes, hose replacements)
- Potential fuel spills during tank servicing or refueling
- Residual fluids from equipment wash-down

These spill risks may be governed by provincial environmental regulations (Alberta Environmental Protection Act) and/or AHJ/Fire Code requirements for hazardous material containment.

**Design-Builder responsibility:** During proposal stage, document the assumed approach to fluid containment:
- If secondary containment (portable drip trays, spill kits) is relied upon: document this operational procedure in the proposal narrative and note that it is not a design feature
- If physical secondary containment is proposed (e.g., oil/water separator in sump discharge, or bermed storage area for fluid containers): show this feature in layout drawings and coordinate with DEL-02-05 mechanical design
- If no additional containment beyond the sump is proposed: document the rationale and confirm with environmental/AHJ requirements

Post-award, confirm specific environmental/fire code requirements with AHJ and Environmental Consultant, and finalize the design approach.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.8 (sumps); Alberta Environmental Protection Act; potential ABC/Fire Code hazmat storage provisions (specific references TBD with AHJ)

### C8: Acoustic Separation Between Shop Bays and Support Spaces (F-003)
No source document addresses noise transmission from shop bay operations (vehicle idling, pneumatic tools, welding) to adjacent support spaces (office, locker room). Given that the shop office is intended for duty use with telephone and computer work (Functional Program Row 25.0), and that shop bay noise levels during equipment operations are substantial, the Design-Builder should consider whether wall STC ratings or acoustic treatment between the shop bay volume and the office/locker room are warranted. This affects occupant comfort and may affect ABC compliance for office-type occupancy.

**ASSUMPTION:** Acoustic separation requirements are TBD — no specific ABC noise/occupancy requirement has been identified. The Design-Builder should propose an approach if the office is directly adjacent to the shop bay volume.

**Source:** Functional Program Row 25.0 (shop office function); ABC noise/occupancy requirements (location TBD)

### C6A: Fire Separation Between Shop and Support Spaces (C-002)
The PW shop bays (likely Group F, Division 3 occupancy per ABC) share the building with PW support spaces (office, locker room) that may fall under a different occupancy classification. ABC Part 3, Section 3.2 and Table 3.2.2.4 require fire separations between different major occupancies.

**Design requirement:** No existing source document explicitly addresses fire separation requirements between the shop bay volume and the adjacent support spaces. This is a regulatory requirement that must be resolved during design development. Fire separation rating and construction details have direct implications for layout decisions (wall assembly types, door ratings, penetration sealing) and must be coordinated with DEL-02-04 for structural/assembly integration.

**Process:** During design development, confirm with AHJ and Code Consultant: (a) occupancy classification for PW shop bays and support spaces; (b) if different occupancies, the required fire resistance rating (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour) per ABC Table 3.2.2.4; (c) wall and door assembly specifications meeting the required rating. Document the occupancy classification and fire separation rating in the design basis and coordinate wall details with DEL-02-04.

**Source:** ABC Part 3 occupancy separation (Table 3.2.2.4); Specification REQ-2303-19

### C6: Key Fob / Access Control Interface
The Functional Program indicates "Key Fob Access" for several PW spaces (Rows 22.0–28.0). If the optional access control system (SOW-0502) is selected, the PW shop areas are among the zones to be controlled. The layout should identify door locations that logically serve as access control points. The base design does not price access control — this is a separate option.

## Trade-offs

### T1: Bay Width vs. Buildable Area

**Tension:** Wider bays support safer two-grader operation and future fleet flexibility; wider bays increase building footprint and structural span costs.

**Resolution:** Bay size should be validated against the grader turning radius (23'8") and required maneuvering clearances. The Functional Program approximate size of 2,000–2,200 ft² per bay should be treated as an Owner-informed target, not a ceiling. If the equipment analysis shows a larger bay is needed for safe two-grader accommodation, the bay size should be increased accordingly and the cost tradeoff presented to the Owner.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.21; Functional Program Equipment List; OSR §10.2

### T2: Dedicated Welding Bay vs. Dual-Use Workshop

**Tension:** A dedicated welding bay with enhanced ventilation provides a safer, better-controlled welding environment; it adds cost and reduces flexible floor area.

**Resolution:** The Owner has confirmed a dedicated welding bay is not required. The Design-Builder may propose one as a value-add if the cost is justified by operational benefit. The base design should integrate welding capability into the workshop/workspace bay with appropriate general ventilation.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.11; SOW-0213

### T3: Single-Storey vs. Two-Storey for PW Support Spaces

**Tension:** Stacking PW support spaces above the bay program could reduce building footprint; it adds structural complexity and complicates bay access.

**Resolution:** ASSUMPTION — the PW shop bays are expected to remain at grade level (drive-through function requires it). PW support spaces (locker room, office, PPE) may be arranged adjacent to the bay volume or in a mezzanine/second storey above non-bay areas if the Design-Builder proposes a two-storey approach (SOW-0601). The shop washroom is specifically noted to be accessible from the shop side without entering the office, which requires careful level coordination if a two-storey approach is used.

## Examples

No directly applicable precedent examples are available from the accessible reference documents. TBD — the Design-Builder's proposal narrative and schematic layouts will serve as the primary examples for evaluator reference.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

The following open items warrant human attention. Items marked with a lensing register ID (e.g., F-001) were identified during Pass 3 semantic lensing enrichment.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | PROPOSAL | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-2303-01 | Minimum structural clear height is not explicitly stated in OSR for PW bays. Equipment list shows sweeper hopper raised to 22'. Addendum 03 §1.21 lists Workshop Bays at 2,000–2,200 ft² but gives no height dimension. | Functional Program Equipment List (RFP p.48): sweeper height 22' at operational height | Addendum 03 §1.21 table: no height specified | Spec REQ-2303-16; Guidance C2; Procedure Step 3; Procedure Verification table | Use 22–24 ft structural clear height as design starting assumption; Architectural/Structural lead to confirm exact value against full equipment list with operational heights and specify safety margin (typical 2–3 ft). Document in design basis. | TBD |
| CONF-2303-02 (F-001) | Support space floor finish terminology is inconsistent. Datasheet says "resilient material, easily cleaned (sealed concrete acceptable/desired)" for support spaces. Guidance P6 states sealed concrete is "the required and preferred floor finish" for bay and shop areas. The scope of P6 relative to support spaces (locker room, office) is ambiguous. | Datasheet: Construction > Materials and Finishes — "Resilient material" (OSR §10.3.8) | Guidance P6: "Sealed Concrete Is the Required and Preferred Floor Finish" (OSR §10.3.8; Addendum 03 §1.3) | Datasheet: Construction; Guidance: P6; Spec: REQ-2303-08, REQ-2303-18 | Confirm with Owner whether support spaces (locker room, office, washroom) should follow the same sealed concrete finish as bay areas or require a differentiated resilient finish (e.g., commercial vinyl, epoxy). OSR §10.3.8 language suggests sealed concrete is for bays; support spaces may warrant different treatment for durability and maintenance profile. Document Owner decision in design basis and specify finishes consistently across all documents. | TBD |
| CONF-2303-03 (C-002) | Fire separation between PW shop bays and support spaces is not explicitly addressed in any source document, but ABC Part 3 requires fire separations between different major occupancies. Shop bays are likely Group F, Division 3; support spaces may be Group B (office) or Group A (change facility). | ABC Part 3, Section 3.2, Table 3.2.2.4 (fire separation requirements) | Addendum 03 §1.8 and other sources address shop function but do not enumerate occupancy classification or fire separation | Specification REQ-2303-19; Guidance C6A; layout/wall assembly details | Confirm occupancy classification for PW shop bays and support spaces with AHJ and Code Consultant during design development. If different occupancies, determine required fire resistance rating (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour) per ABC Table 3.2.2.4. Coordinate wall and door assembly specifications with DEL-02-04. Document in design basis. | TBD |
| CONF-2303-04 (C-003) | Vehicle fluid containment for maintenance activities (oil, hydraulic fluid, fuel) is not addressed in source documents. Addendum 03 §1.8 specifies sumps for "snow melt and minor washing" but does not address spill prevention for routine vehicle servicing. Potential environmental and fire code implications. | Addendum 03 §1.8 (sumps for snow melt/minor washing only) | Provincial environmental regulations (Alberta Environmental Protection Act — specific requirements TBD); ABC/Fire Code hazmat containment (specific provisions TBD) | Specification (potential new requirement), Guidance C7, Procedure Steps 4, 12 | Design-Builder to document assumed approach to fluid containment during proposal (e.g., operational spill kit vs. physical secondary containment). Confirm environmental/fire code requirements with AHJ and Environmental Consultant post-award. If physical secondary containment required, incorporate into layout and coordinate with DEL-02-05 mechanical design. | TBD |
