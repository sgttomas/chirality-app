## Steps

### Phase A: Proposal Development (Design-Build Proposal Stage)

**Step 1: Extract and tabulate the PW equipment list**

Review the Public Works Critical Design Equipment List (Functional Program, RFP pp.47-48) and extract all equipment that will be housed in the shop bays. Record critical dimensions (length, width, height at operational positions, minimum turning radius) for each unit. Identify the governing dimensional constraints for:
- Bay width (governing: grader moldboard width — 14' W for John Deere GP770)
- Bay length (governing: two graders in tandem or side-by-side; drive-through length)
- Structural clear height (governing: sweeper with hopper raised — 22' for Elgin/Nissan Eagle/3300)

**Verify against:** Functional Program Equipment List (RFP pp.47-48); OSR §10.3.5 (RFP p.40)

---

**Step 2: Develop initial bay layout concept**

Establish the drive-through bay configuration (enter one end, exit the other) for four bays. Sketch bay widths and lengths sufficient to accommodate two average graders per bay with safe clearance margins. Coordinate structural bay spacing with DEL-02-04 Structural lead. Confirm that 16' × 16' overhead door positions are consistent with drive-through alignment.

Note floor sump positions (one or more per bay — coordinate with DEL-02-05) and water fill station location (one in PW bay area — coordinate with DEL-02-05).

**Verify against:** OSR §10.2; SOW-0211; Addendum 03 §1.10; REQ-2303-01 through REQ-2303-06

---

**Step 3: Confirm structural clear height assumption**

Working with the DEL-02-04 Structural lead, establish the target structural clear height for the shop bays. Use the equipment operational height list from Step 1. ASSUMPTION: starting design target of 22–24 ft clear height pending structural confirmation. Document the assumption and equipment basis in the proposal narrative.

**Verify against:** OSR §10.3.9 (RFP p.41); CONF-2303-01 (Guidance Conflict Table)

---

**Step 4: Develop workshop and storage concept**

Lay out the workshop/workspace area (half welding/maintenance, half parts storage — Functional Program Row 28.0) and enclosed warm storage area (Functional Program Row 23.0) within or adjacent to the bay program. Indicate:
- Intended compressed air line routing and outlet locations
- Workshop clearance zones for vehicle maintenance
- Enclosed storage area boundaries and access points

**Verify against:** OSW-0212; Functional Program Rows 23.0, 28.0; REQ-2303-09, REQ-2303-10, REQ-2303-11

---

**Step 5: Develop PW support spaces layout**

Lay out the following spaces in logical workflow sequence (from vehicle yard entry to bay access to office):
- PW Locker Room (40 industrial lockers, 2 bathrooms/change rooms, 2 standalone showers)
- Shop First Aid & PPE Room (~100–150 ft²; first aid, PPE storage, food washing)
- Shop Work Office (duty office, shared; phone, computer, internet)
- Shop Washroom (toilet and sink, accessible from shop side without entering office area)

Confirm washroom fixture counts against Alberta Building Code for the occupancy load. Identify key fob access control door positions.

**Verify against:** SOW-0209, SOW-0210; Functional Program Rows 22.0–26.0; REQ-2303-12 through REQ-2303-15; REQ-2303-17

---

**Step 6: Coordinate interfaces with other DEL-02-## deliverables**

Conduct a coordination review against:
- DEL-02-01: Confirm PW shop zone boundary within overall building footprint
- DEL-02-04: Confirm structural bay spacing, overhead door rough openings, and clear height
- DEL-02-05: Confirm sump locations, ventilation interface points, water fill station rough-in, and air line routing
- DEL-02-06: Confirm lighting fixture locations, electrical outlet/receptacle positions in bays and support spaces, and key fob reader locations

Document coordination outcomes (confirmed or flagged for resolution) in the proposal narrative.

**Verify against:** _DEPENDENCIES.md coordination mode; interdisciplinary coordination requirements

---

**Step 7: Prepare deliverable artifacts for proposal submission**

Assemble the following artifacts for inclusion in the proposal package:
- Shop bay layouts (floor plan, minimum 1:100 scale or equivalent)
- Workshop + storage concept (schematic floor plan or annotated diagram with narrative)
- PPE/locker layouts (floor plan showing locker positions, showers, washrooms, PPE room)
- Shop office/washroom layouts (floor plan)
- Brief narrative summarizing design rationale, equipment validation approach, and key design decisions

Ensure all drawings reference scale, north arrow, and room labels consistent with the Functional Program terminology.

---

### Phase B: Detailed Design and Construction (Post-Award)

**Step 7A: Post-Award Coordination Verification Checkpoint (E-002)**

At the start of Phase B (post-award), before proceeding to detailed design, conduct a formal coordination verification checkpoint:
- Confirm that all DEL-02-xx interface commitments from Step 6 are still valid after contract award (structural bay spacing, sump locations, ventilation interfaces, electrical coordination)
- Confirm Owner scope selections: specifically, whether the optional wash bay (SOW-0500) has been selected, which affects bay count (REQ-2303-01)
- Document any changes from proposal-stage coordination outcomes
- If scope selections or coordination outcomes have changed, update the design basis and notify affected discipline leads

**Verify against:** Step 6 coordination outcomes; Owner scope confirmation letter/meeting minutes

---

**Step 7B: Wash Bay Option Decision Gate (D-001)**

If the Owner has selected the wash bay option (SOW-0500), execute the following design modification path:
- Identify which bay (ASSUMPTION: Bay 4) will be converted to wash bay configuration
- Document layout adjustments required: plumbing rough-in for wash bay drainage, water supply, and recirculation (if applicable)
- Coordinate with DEL-05-01 for wash bay design requirements and interface points
- Confirm that the remaining three PW drive-through bays still meet the fleet accommodation requirements (2 graders per bay)
- If Owner has NOT selected the wash bay option, document "wash bay option declined" and proceed with four-bay base design

**Verify against:** REQ-2303-01; Guidance C1; SOW-0500; Owner scope selection confirmation

---

**Step 8: Confirm equipment list and bay dimensions with Owner**

At design development kickoff, review the PW equipment list with Owner/Public Works stakeholders to confirm current fleet and anticipated replacements over the 50-year design life. Adjust bay dimensions and clear height if the confirmed fleet differs from the proposal-stage equipment list.

**Step 9: Develop detailed floor plans and room data sheets**

Produce detailed architectural floor plans for all PW shop and support areas, including:
- Dimensioned bay layouts with sump, fill station, door, and air line locations
- Room data sheets for locker room, PPE room, office, and washroom (dimensions, finishes, power, data, plumbing)
- Coordination of accessible path of travel through support spaces

**Step 10: Execute multi-discipline coordination (mechanical, structural, electrical)**

Coordinate with DEL-02-05 for sump drainage, ventilation supply/exhaust design, water fill station rough-in, and compressed air distribution. Coordinate with DEL-02-04 for structural framing above bays and overhead door specifications. Coordinate with DEL-02-06 for bay lighting levels per IES recommendations and electrical outlet/receptacle layout.

Issue and resolve RFIs as required. Produce coordination drawings or BIM clash reports as part of the QA/QC process (DEL-01-01).

**Step 11: Obtain AHJ review and building permit**

Incorporate PW shop and support space drawings into the building permit set. Address AHJ review comments for occupancy classification, accessibility, ventilation, and plumbing fixture counts.

**Step 12: Construction — bay and support space works**

Execute the following in accordance with IFC drawings:
- Bay slab preparation and pour (sealed concrete with aprons at all overhead door locations)
- Bay sump installation (coordinate with DEL-02-05)
- Overhead door installation (16' × 16' with windows, motorized openers, car wash grade hardware, secondary opening mechanism)
- Workshop and storage area construction
- Locker room, PPE room, office, and washroom fitout (lockers, plumbing fixtures, partitions)
- Compressed air line installation and testing
- Water fill station installation and commissioning

**Step 13: Commissioning and functional testing**

Prior to occupancy:
- Operate all overhead doors (motorized and secondary mechanism) and confirm proper function
- Test bay sump drainage for adequate capacity for snow melt and minor washing
- Test water fill station flow rate (minimum 2-inch supply)
- Confirm compressed air line pressure and outlet function at each bay position
- Walk through locker room, PPE room, office, and washroom with Owner to confirm operational readiness
