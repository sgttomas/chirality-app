### Key Equipment Driving Bay Sizing (from Functional Program, Appendix B, p.47-48)

| Equipment | Dimensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| John Deere GP770 Grader (Unit 39) | 10'5" T × 30' L × 8'2" W; Moldboard 14' W; Min Turning Radius 23'8" | Primary sizing driver per OSR §10.2 (2 graders per bay) |

### Vehicle-to-Bay Assignment (B-002)

**Status:** TBD — no vehicle-to-bay assignment table has been confirmed at the proposal stage. The Design-Builder's fleet-to-bay allocation will drive layout decisions, including:
- Which bays accommodate the largest equipment (e.g., two graders side-by-side vs. tandem)
- How equipment storage is sequenced for operational efficiency
- Whether bay 4 remains available for potential wash bay conversion (if SOW-0500 selected)

This assignment is referenced in Guidance P1 and Procedure Step 1.

**Design-Builder responsibility:** Develop and document a vehicle-to-bay assignment matrix as part of the proposal design submission. The matrix should show: Equipment unit → Designated bay(s) → Intended storage location within bay (near sump, near fill station, etc.) → Access/egress routing. Cross-reference this matrix with the equipment maneuvering templates (per Specification REQ-2303-02 and Verification requirement X-002).

**Confirmation:** Assignment to be reviewed and confirmed with Owner/PW stakeholders during design development (see Procedure Step 8). If confirmed equipment differs from RFP Functional Program list, bay dimensions may require adjustment.

## Construction

### Materials and Finishes

| Element | Requirement | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Bay floor | Sealed concrete; concrete aprons at overhead door access points | OSR §10.3.8 (RFP p.41); OSR §10.3.10 |
| Interior flooring — support spaces | Resilient material, easily cleaned (sealed concrete acceptable/desired). **Normalization note (F-001):** Guidance P6 identifies sealed concrete as the required and preferred finish for bay and shop areas. The scope of this requirement relative to support spaces (locker room, office, washroom) is ambiguous. OSR §10.3.8 appears to address bay floors specifically; support spaces may warrant a different finish. Clarification needed: confirm with Owner whether all PW interior spaces (including locker room, office, washroom) should receive sealed concrete, or whether support spaces should receive an alternative resilient finish (e.g., commercial-grade vinyl or epoxy coating). Document Owner's decision and rationale in the design basis. See Guidance Conflict Table entry CONF-2303-02. | OSR §10.3.8; Addendum 03 §1.3; Guidance P6 |
| Ceiling type | Not prescribed by Owner; DB to propose appropriate approach for durability, acoustics, and code compliance | Addendum 03 §1.3; SOW-0218 |
| Building materials — general | Durable, low-maintenance, watertight, non-combustible construction | OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44) |

### Structural Constraints

| Element | Requirement | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Roof/structural height | Must provide clearance for safe operation of heavy PW equipment (graders, tandem dumps, loaders, sweepers) | OSR §10.3.9 (RFP p.41) |
| Structural design | Withstand snow loads, lateral loads, and wind loads appropriate for Penhold, Alberta | OSR §10.3.5 (RFP p.40) |
| Post-disaster category | AHJ intends to exempt post-disaster designation for this building | OSR §10.3.5 (RFP p.40) |
