# Deliverable: DEL-02-03 Public Works Shop Bays, Workshop & Support Spaces

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to articulate the spatial, functional, and operational design knowledge required for heavy-equipment maintenance bays, workshop/storage workflows, and personnel support facilities within a multi-use municipal public services building. It must carry knowledge that bridges fleet-specific dimensional requirements, multi-discipline interface coordination, and occupant workflow integrity across the full lifecycle from proposal through commissioning.

- Resolved Value Commitment * Foundational Directive Anchor = "committed foundational value"
- Confirmed Merit Delivery * Essential Implementation Readiness = "validated quality preparedness"
- Definitive Worth Judgment * Critical Adjudication Finding = "conclusive value determination"
- Resolved Quality Governance * Critical Governance Oversight = "settled quality enforcement"

L_E = {committed foundational value, validated quality preparedness, conclusive value determination, settled quality enforcement}

**I(evaluative, necessity, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * necessity = "essential worth"

Step 2: Projections:
- p1 = essential worth * committed foundational value = "fundamental value commitment"
- p2 = essential worth * validated quality preparedness = "critical quality readiness"
- p3 = essential worth * conclusive value determination = "definitive merit finding"
- p4 = essential worth * settled quality enforcement = "required quality governance"

Step 3: Centroid of {fundamental value commitment, critical quality readiness, definitive merit finding, required quality governance} --> u = **"Fundamental Quality Imperative"**

- p2 = adequate worth * verified merit adequacy = "proven merit basis"
- p3 = adequate worth * substantiated worth proof = "demonstrated value"
- p4 = adequate worth * confirmed quality oversight = "justified quality governance"

Step 3: Centroid of {validated quality adequacy, proven merit basis, demonstrated value, justified quality governance} --> u = **"Demonstrated Value Sufficiency"**

- Confirmed Merit Delivery * Comprehensive Implementation Breadth = "complete merit span"
- Definitive Worth Judgment * Exhaustive Adjudication Scope = "total worth adjudication"
- Resolved Quality Governance * Exhaustive Oversight Breadth = "comprehensive quality span"

L_E = {total value direction, complete merit span, total worth adjudication, comprehensive quality span}

**I(evaluative, completeness, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = "total worth"

Step 2: Projections:
- p1 = total worth * total value direction = "exhaustive value scope"
- p2 = total worth * complete merit span = "comprehensive merit coverage"
- p3 = total worth * total worth adjudication = "thorough quality determination"
- p4 = total worth * comprehensive quality span = "holistic quality breadth"

Step 3: Centroid of {exhaustive value scope, comprehensive merit coverage, thorough quality determination, holistic quality breadth} --> u = **"Holistic Quality Completeness"**

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- Resolved Value Commitment * Coherent Directive Stewardship = "aligned value governance"

**I(evaluative, consistency, L_E):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = "reliable worth"

Step 2: Projections:
