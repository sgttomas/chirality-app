The PW shop areas shall be designed using durable, low-maintenance materials and techniques appropriate for a municipal operations facility with 50-year building life expectancy.

**Source:** OSR §10.2; OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44); SOW-0201; SOW-0220

### REQ-2303-18A: Vehicle Fluid Spill Prevention and Containment (C-003)
The Design-Builder shall document the approach to vehicle fluid spill prevention and containment for routine maintenance activities in the shop bays and workshop areas. Scope includes oil changes, hydraulic fluid handling, and fuel management activities.

**Design approach options (Design-Builder to select and document):**
1. Operational spill control (e.g., portable drip trays, spill kits) — no additional design features; reliance on staff procedures and spill response plan
2. Physical secondary containment (e.g., bermed floor area, oil/water separator at sump discharge, contained fluid storage area) — integrated into layout and coordination with DEL-02-05

**Confirmation required:** Environmental Consultant and AHJ shall confirm applicable provincial environmental regulations (Alberta Environmental Protection Act) and Fire Code requirements for hazardous material containment and spill response. Design shall be updated post-award to meet confirmed requirements.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.8 (sumps for snow melt/minor washing); potential environmental regulations (specific requirements TBD); potential ABC/Fire Code hazmat provisions (specific requirements TBD)
**Note:** Guidance C7 provides additional context on this consideration.
