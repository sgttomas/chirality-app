## Requirements

### REQ-01-02-001 — Proposal Gantt Schedule
The Design-Builder shall include in the Proposal a detailed project schedule in Gantt Chart format.
- The schedule shall illustrate the Design-Builder's commitment to meet the proposed schedule.
- The schedule shall identify durations of key work packages from Design through Construction Substantial Performance and Close-Out.
- The schedule shall identify dates of all milestones.
- The Critical Path shall be identified in the Gantt Chart.
- Submission file format: TBD — RFP specifies "Gantt Chart" but does not prescribe whether submission is PDF export, native scheduling software file, or both. File-naming convention: TBD. [Lensing A-002]

**Source:** RFP §7.1.9

---

### REQ-01-02-002 — Baseline Schedule Submission Timeline
Within twenty (20) calendar days of contract award, the Design-Builder shall submit a detailed project schedule to the Project Manager.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control)

---

### REQ-01-02-003 — Baseline Schedule Approval and Incorporation
The Project Committee will review the submitted schedule. Once accepted by the Project Manager, the schedule shall:
- Become the baseline for the project moving forward.
- Form part of the Master Project Schedule.
- Form part of the Contract (once agreed upon as noted at proposal stage).

**Source:** RFP §7.1.9; RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control)

---

### REQ-01-02-004 — Monthly Schedule Updates
The Design-Builder shall update the schedule and report to the Project Manager on a monthly basis. Each monthly update shall:
- Identify the percentage completion of each Task. **Note:** Measurement method for "percentage completion" is TBD — RFP does not specify whether this is earned value, physical percent complete, duration-based, or other method. Different methods yield different results. [Lensing B-003]
- Incorporate approved Change Orders, if any.
- Be issued with the meeting agenda.
- Show all progress against each milestone.
- Identify any slippage with explanations.
- Include plans for schedule recovery where applicable. **Note:** Minimum content for a "plan for schedule recovery" is TBD — neither RFP nor other accessible sources define what a recovery plan must contain. [Lensing X-002]

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control); RFP §7.3.5

---

### REQ-01-02-005 — Progress Meeting Reporting
At design/construction progress meetings, the Design-Builder shall report on progress, schedule, milestones, present challenges, and issues, as well as proposed solutions, for review and consideration by the Project Committee.

**Source:** RFP §7.3.5

---

### REQ-01-02-006 — Schedule Flexibility Optimization
The Design-Builder shall propose a project schedule and completion date that is most cost-effective and suitable to the Design-Builder. The Owner expects proponents to leverage schedule flexibility to reduce capital costs or increase value.

**Source:** RFP §2.2 (Background); OSR §10.2.3; SOW-0602

---

### REQ-01-02-007 — Critical Path Narrative
The Design-Builder shall provide a critical path narrative describing critical path logic, key dependencies, and the approach to managing schedule risk.

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); **ASSUMPTION:** standard expectation for critical path scheduling per project controls discipline best practice.

**Normative Authority Status [Lensing A-001]:** This requirement's source is _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts) and ASSUMPTION-based inference rather than an explicit RFP clause. RFP §7.1.9 requires "critical path" identification in the Gantt Chart but does not explicitly require a separate narrative document. **Enrichment:** Strengthen source attribution. Recommend confirming whether critical path narrative is a contractual obligation (normative requirement) or a best-practice expectation that should be treated as guidance.

---

### REQ-01-02-008 — Monthly Progress/Control Reports
The Design-Builder shall provide monthly progress reports covering schedule, milestones, present challenges, issues, and proposed solutions.

**Source:** RFP §7.3.5; _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts)

---

## Standards

| Standard | Description | Applicability | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| CCDC 14-2013 | Design-Build stipulated price contract; defines contract administration, schedule, and change order provisions. **Gap [C-002]:** Specific CCDC 14-2013 schedule-related clauses (delay claims, change order timeline impacts, scheduling obligations) cannot be confirmed until Appendix J supplementary conditions are reviewed. Regulatory completeness TBD. **Enrichment:** Add reference to specific CCDC 14-2013 schedule-related clauses once Appendix J supplementary conditions are reviewed. | Governing contract form | RFP §5.4; Appendix J (location TBD — full Appendix J not reviewed) |
| NMS (National Master Specification) format | Recommended format for hard copy documents and reports used on the Project | Recommended, not mandatory | RFP §7.2 (Quality Management) |
| Alberta Occupational Health & Safety Act | Governs construction site operations; schedule must reflect H&S compliance phasing. **Weak Sourcing [F-001]:** Applicability to schedule phasing is marked as ASSUMPTION and unconfirmed. **Enrichment:** Clarify applicability of Alberta OH&S Act to schedule phasing. Confirm whether this is a verified requirement or an unconfirmed assumption. If confirmed, add specific schedule phasing requirements (e.g., safety orientation timing, confined space scheduling). If not in scope, remove this entry. | **ASSUMPTION:** likely applicable to schedule phasing — requires confirmation | RFP §7.2 (Health and Safety) |

---

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification Approach |
|---|---|
| REQ-01-02-001 — Proposal Gantt schedule submitted with Proposal | Proposal submission review: confirm Gantt chart present, milestones identified, critical path marked. **Evaluation acceptance criteria — TBD [C-003, D-002]:** The 2-point scoring allocation (RFP §8.2) evaluates "understanding of requirements" and "certainty of success" (RFP §8.3). Specific criteria for awarding points are TBD. **Enrichment [D-002]:** Add quality acceptance criteria for schedule artifacts: define what constitutes an acceptable-quality Gantt chart (e.g., minimum level of detail, dependency logic completeness, critical path validity check). Worth adjudication requires quality criteria; current check confirms presence but not quality. |
| REQ-01-02-002 — Baseline submitted within 20 calendar days of award | Date-stamp review: confirm receipt date within 20 calendar days of contract award date |
| REQ-01-02-003 — Baseline approved and incorporated | Project Committee meeting record confirms acceptance; contract and Master Project Schedule updated to include baseline |
| REQ-01-02-004 — Monthly updates issued | Monthly review: confirm update includes % completion per Task, Change Orders, milestone progress, slippage, recovery plans |
| REQ-01-02-005 — Progress meeting reporting | Meeting minutes confirm schedule reporting occurred at each meeting |
| REQ-01-02-006 — Schedule optimized for cost/value | Proposal evaluation: reviewer assesses whether proposed schedule demonstrates cost/value optimization rationale. **Weakness [A-003, E-002]:** Current verification is subjective — observable evidence criteria for "cost-effective" optimization are TBD. **Enrichment:** Add evidence gate for cost-optimization. Require: (a) explicit written rationale documenting how schedule duration reduces costs vs. alternatives, (b) identification of specific cost-saving scheduling decisions (e.g., off-peak procurement, phased mobilization). Link to Datasheet attribute "Owner schedule-driven? No". Without this gate, schedule claims cost-effectiveness without demonstration. |
| REQ-01-02-007 — Critical path narrative provided | Document review: confirm narrative present and logically consistent with Gantt |
| REQ-01-02-008 — Monthly progress reports issued | Project Manager confirms receipt of monthly reports; reports reviewed for completeness |

**Non-Conformance Consequences — TBD [D-001]**

The Specification defines requirements and verification approaches but does not state consequences of non-conformance. **Enrichment [D-001]:** Add conformance consequences to improve enforcement. Specify what happens if:
- Baseline schedule is not submitted within 20 calendar days (REQ-01-02-002)?
- Monthly updates are not issued (REQ-01-02-004)?
- CCDC 14-2013 may contain relevant default remedy/cure provisions but Appendix J has not been reviewed (location TBD).

**Schedule Performance Metrics — TBD [A-005]**

No quantified schedule performance assessment criteria (KPIs) are currently defined. **Enrichment [A-005]:** Add schedule performance metrics or KPIs (e.g., schedule variance thresholds, float consumption limits) that define what constitutes acceptable schedule performance during monthly updates. Candidates for human determination:
- Schedule variance threshold triggering formal corrective action (e.g., > X% slippage against baseline)
- Total float consumption limit as a percentage of original total float
- Critical path slippage trigger requiring formal recovery plan submission
- Milestone achievement rate threshold

These are not derived from accessible RFP sources and require Owner/Project Committee input to establish.
