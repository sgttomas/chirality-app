## Steps

### Part A — Producing the Proposal-Stage Schedule (Pre-Award)

**Step A1 — Define Work Package Structure**
Identify and list key work packages covering the full project lifecycle from Design through Close-Out. At minimum, include:
- Design phase milestones: Building Design Development, 60% Detailed Design, Foundation IFC (if applicable), 100% Building Detail Design, 100% IFC package (per RFP §7.1.8)
- Permitting phase
- Construction phase: site work, foundations, structure, envelope, MEP systems, finishes
- Commissioning and Close-Out phase
- Deficiency resolution period

Source: RFP §7.1.8; RFP §7.1.9.

**Step A2 — Sequence Activities and Identify Dependencies**
Map logical dependencies between work packages. Identify the critical path — the longest chain of dependent activities determining the minimum project duration.

Source: RFP §7.1.9 (critical path must be identified in Gantt Chart).

**Step A3 — Optimize Schedule Duration for Cost-Effectiveness**
Review the proposed duration against the Owner's stated preference for cost-optimized scheduling (not the fastest possible schedule). Consider:
- Off-peak procurement windows
- Subcontractor availability and competitive pricing windows
- Avoiding unnecessary acceleration costs
Document the cost-optimization rationale for inclusion in the proposal.

Source: RFP §2.2 (Background); OSR §10.2.3; SOW-0602.

**Step A4 — Assign Durations and Milestone Dates**
Assign durations to each work package. Note that Substantial Completion and Total Completion dates are Design-Builder-proposed (RFP §2.6). Record proposed milestone dates.

Source: RFP §2.6; RFP §7.1.9.

**Step A5 — Produce Gantt Chart**
Produce the Gantt Chart in the specified format. Verify that:
- All key work packages are shown with durations
- All milestone dates are marked
- Critical path is visually identified

Source: RFP §7.1.9.

**Step A6 — Draft Critical Path Narrative**
Write a brief narrative explaining:
- The critical path activities and their logical sequence
- Key dependencies governing project completion
- Approach to managing schedule risk (buffer, float, etc.)

Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); REQ-01-02-007.

**Step A7 — Assemble Proposal Schedule Package**
Compile the Gantt Chart and critical path narrative for inclusion in the Proposal submission package. Ensure compatibility with overall Proposal formatting requirements.

**Note [X-001]:** RFP §4.2 (Proposal Format) is referenced but the actual formatting directive has not been reviewed (location TBD). **Enrichment [X-001]:** Add step addressing Proposal formatting requirements and confirm:
- Is the schedule a standalone appendix to the Proposal or embedded within the Project Delivery Plan narrative section?
- Are there page limits or format constraints (page size, orientation) that affect the Gantt Chart presentation?
- What file format is required for electronic submission (if applicable)?

These must be confirmed from RFP §4.2 before finalizing the proposal schedule package.

Source: RFP §7.1.9; RFP §4.2 (Proposal Format, location TBD).

### Part B — Producing the Post-Award Baseline Schedule

**Step B1 — Initiate Baseline Preparation at Contract Award**
On contract award date, note the 20 calendar day deadline for baseline schedule submission. Assign the PM/Scheduler to prepare the baseline immediately.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control).

**Step B2 — Refine Work Package Structure and Durations**
Update the proposal-stage schedule to reflect any contract clarifications, scope confirmations, and updated subcontractor/supplier information. The baseline may be more detailed than the proposal schedule.

ASSUMPTION: Reasonable continuity with the proposal schedule is expected. Significant changes should be flagged to the Project Manager.

**Step B3 — Add Resource and Subcontractor Information**
ASSUMPTION: The baseline should incorporate known subcontractor commitments and resource allocations where available, to improve reliability of percentage-completion tracking in monthly updates.

**Step B4 — Submit to Project Manager Within 20 Calendar Days**
Formally submit the detailed project schedule to the Project Manager within 20 calendar days of contract award.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control).

**Step B5 — Project Committee Review and Acceptance**
The Project Committee reviews the submitted schedule. The Design-Builder shall respond to any questions or revision requests. Once accepted by the Project Manager, the schedule becomes:
- The project baseline
- Part of the Master Project Schedule
- Incorporated into the Contract

**Step B5a — Schedule Rejection/Revision Cycle [A-004]**
If the Project Committee does not accept the baseline schedule:
1. The Project Manager issues written comments identifying deficiencies or required revisions.
2. The Design-Builder revises the schedule to address the comments and resubmits within TBD business days of receiving comments. (**Note [A-004]:** Resubmission timeframe is not specified in accessible RFP sources. **Enrichment:** Add step or sub-step addressing the scenario where Project Committee does not accept the baseline schedule — define rejection/revision cycle including resubmission timeframe and iteration loop. This gap means Procedure Step B5 describes submission and acceptance but does not address what happens if the schedule is rejected.)
3. Steps B5 and B5a repeat until acceptance is obtained.
4. If acceptance cannot be reached, escalation path is TBD. (**Note:** CCDC 14-2013 dispute resolution provisions may apply but Appendix J has not been reviewed.)

**ASSUMPTION:** This rejection/revision cycle is standard practice for design-build contract schedule approval but is not explicitly described in the RFP. The 20 calendar day submission deadline (REQ-01-02-002) applies to initial submission, not to the resolution of review comments.

### Part C — Operating the Monthly Update and Reporting Cycle (Post-Baseline)

**Step C1 — Monthly Schedule Update**
Prior to each monthly progress meeting, prepare an updated schedule showing:
- Percentage completion of each Task (measurement method TBD — see Specification REQ-01-02-004 note [B-003])
- Approved Change Orders incorporated
- Progress against each milestone
- Any slippage, with explanations
- Plans for schedule recovery where slippage exists

**Schedule Recovery Plan Content [X-002]:** When a recovery plan is required, minimum content is TBD. **Enrichment [X-002]:** Add verification check or procedural step defining what a "plan for schedule recovery" must contain when slippage is reported in monthly updates. Candidate elements (not sourced from RFP — **ASSUMPTION** based on project controls practice):
- Identification of activities causing slippage and root cause
- Proposed corrective actions (re-sequencing, acceleration, resource reallocation)
- Revised milestone dates (if applicable)
- Impact on critical path
- Cost implications of recovery actions (if any)

Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control); RFP §7.3.5.

**Step C2 — Issue Updated Schedule with Meeting Agenda**
Issue the updated project schedule together with the meeting agenda, at least 3 business days before the progress meeting.

Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step C3 — Report at Progress Meeting**
At the progress meeting, report on:
- Progress against schedule and milestones
- Present challenges and issues
- Proposed solutions for any schedule concerns

The Project Committee reviews and may provide direction.

Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step C4 — Issue Meeting Minutes**
Issue meeting minutes within 4 business days following the meeting. Minutes shall record schedule status, decisions made, and any schedule revision direction.

**Scope Boundary Note [E-001]:** It is unclear whether meeting minutes are part of DEL-01-02 scope or belong to DEL-01-05 (Project Controls and Documentation). The Specification Out of Scope section does not address this boundary. **Enrichment [E-001]:** Clarify whether meeting minutes (Step C4) are part of DEL-01-02 scope or DEL-01-05 scope. If DEL-01-02, add to Records table. If DEL-01-05, add cross-reference and remove from Records. See Conflict Table CONF-004 in Guidance.md.

Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step C5 — Issue Monthly Progress/Control Report**
Issue the monthly progress report, which covers schedule, milestone status, challenges, and proposed solutions, in addition to any other required reporting content.

Source: RFP §7.3.5; _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts).

**Step C6 — Manage Change Orders Affecting Schedule**
When a Change Order is approved that affects task durations or the critical path, update the schedule in the next monthly update cycle (or immediately if the change is significant). Ensure the change is clearly identified as a Change Order-driven revision.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control).
