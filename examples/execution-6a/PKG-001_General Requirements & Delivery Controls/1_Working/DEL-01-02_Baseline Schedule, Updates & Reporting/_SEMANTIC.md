# Deliverable: DEL-01-02 Baseline Schedule, Updates & Reporting

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes, contractually baselines, and maintains a project schedule that serves simultaneously as a value-optimization instrument and a formal contract document. It must carry knowledge about temporal sequencing, progress measurement, critical-path governance, and cost-effective phasing from proposal through close-out. The schedule is not a speed-driven artifact but a control and reporting framework that demonstrates credible execution planning while preserving flexibility for capital cost reduction.
