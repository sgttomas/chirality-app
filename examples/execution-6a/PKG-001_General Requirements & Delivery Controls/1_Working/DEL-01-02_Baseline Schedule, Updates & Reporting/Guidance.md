# Guidance: DEL-01-02 Baseline Schedule, Updates & Reporting

---

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to establish, communicate, and maintain the Design-Builder's project schedule for the Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build project. It serves two distinct purposes:

1. **Proposal stage**: Demonstrates to the Owner/Evaluation Committee that the Design-Builder has a credible, coherent project execution approach, with a schedule that is realistic and — critically — optimized for cost-effectiveness rather than speed.
2. **Contract stage**: Provides the project management baseline against which progress is measured, changes are tracked, and reporting is structured throughout design and construction.

The schedule deliverable directly supports OBJ-008: executing a safe, controlled Design-Build delivery while leveraging schedule flexibility for value optimization.

**Sources:** RFP §7.1.9; RFP §7.2; OSR §10.2.3; Decomposition OBJ-008 entry.

## Principles

### P1 — Schedule is a Value Tool, Not Just a Compliance Artifact
The Owner has explicitly stated this project is NOT schedule-driven (RFP §2.2; OSR §10.2.3). The existing Public Works and Firehall facilities remain operational throughout the project, removing urgency-driven constraints. The Design-Builder is strongly encouraged to leverage this flexibility to reduce capital costs. The schedule proposal should demonstrate cost-optimized sequencing, not merely a commitment to the fastest possible completion.

**Source:** RFP §2.2 (Background); OSR §10.2.3.

### P2 — Baseline is a Contract Document
The proposal Gantt schedule, once agreed upon, forms part of the Contract (RFP §7.1.9). The post-award baseline, once accepted by the Project Committee, forms part of the Master Project Schedule. This means schedule changes require proper Change Order treatment — the schedule is not an informal tracking tool.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.9; RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control).

### P3 — Monthly Updates Must Be Substantive
Monthly updates are not a formality. Each update must identify percentage completion of each Task and incorporate approved Change Orders. When slippage occurs, the update must include both an explanation and a recovery plan. This supports the Owner's need for transparent progress information and early risk identification.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control); RFP §7.3.5.

### P4 — Critical Path Must Be Explicit
The critical path must be visually identified in the Gantt Chart. This allows the Owner and Project Manager to understand which activities govern project completion and to assess risk. A separate critical path narrative explaining the logic and key dependencies is expected as part of the deliverable set.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.9; _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts).

### P5 — Reporting Cadence is Tied to Meetings
The Design-Builder chairs progress meetings with the Project Committee (RFP §7.3.5). An updated project schedule must be issued with the meeting agenda (3 business days before the meeting). Meeting minutes are issued within 4 business days following the meeting. The schedule update cadence therefore aligns with the meeting cycle.

**Source:** RFP §7.3.5.

## Considerations

### C1 — Proposal Schedule vs. Baseline Schedule
There are two distinct schedule submissions: (a) the proposal-stage Gantt schedule submitted with the Proposal, and (b) the formal baseline schedule submitted within 20 calendar days of contract award. The proposal schedule is evaluated and scored (2 points, RFP §8.2). The baseline is the contract-binding version. These may differ, but significant divergence would require explanation.

**ASSUMPTION:** The Owner expects reasonable continuity between the proposal schedule and the post-award baseline — large deviations would likely require justification.

### C2 — Gantt Format Requirement
The RFP specifies Gantt Chart format explicitly. While the RFP recommends NMS format for project documents generally, the schedule format is specifically Gantt. Software tool is not prescribed — ASSUMPTION: any standard scheduling software (e.g., MS Project, Primavera P6, or equivalent) producing a legible Gantt chart would satisfy this requirement.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.9; RFP §7.2 (Quality Management, NMS recommendation).

### C3 — Change Order Integration
The monthly schedule update must explicitly incorporate approved Change Orders. This creates a linkage between the change management process (addressed in DEL-01-05_Project-Controls-and-Documentation) and the schedule. Change Orders that extend duration or shift critical path must be reflected in the updated schedule.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control).

### C4 — No Owner-Imposed Completion Date
Substantial Completion and Total Completion dates are listed as "Design-Builder to Propose" in the RFP Schedule (RFP §2.6). This reinforces the non-schedule-driven posture. The Design-Builder has meaningful latitude in proposing a completion timeline that suits their workflow and cost approach.

**Source:** RFP §2.6 (RFP Schedule table).

### C5 — Addenda May Affect Schedule Assumptions
Addenda 01-03 contain scope clarifications that may affect schedule assumptions (e.g., Addendum 03 §1.5 allows optional 2-storey configuration; Addendum 03 §1.6-§1.7 addresses utility tie-in allowance approach). These should be reviewed to confirm schedule assumptions remain valid.

**Enrichment [B-002]:** Record as TBD: Review Addenda 01-03 for schedule-affecting scope changes and update Datasheet Conditions/Attributes if needed. See Datasheet Conditions table.

**Source:** _REFERENCES.md; decomposition entries for Addendum 03.

### C6 — CCDC 14 Schedule/Delay Provisions [C-001]
The Specification Standards table references CCDC 14-2013 as the governing contract form (RFP §5.4), but the interaction between CCDC 14 schedule/delay provisions and the RFP schedule requirements has not been analyzed. CCDC 14-2013 typically contains provisions governing:
- Delay claims and extensions of time
- Change order timeline impacts on project schedule
- Contractor scheduling obligations and Owner review rights

**Enrichment [C-001]:** Add rationale explaining how CCDC 14-2013 schedule provisions interact with RFP schedule requirements (e.g., change order timeline impacts, delay claims provisions). Until the Appendix J supplementary conditions are reviewed (location TBD), the relationship between CCDC 14 default provisions and the RFP's specific schedule requirements (REQ-01-02-002 through REQ-01-02-004) cannot be fully articulated. This is critical for safe interpretation.

**Source:** RFP §5.4; Specification Standards table; Appendix J (location TBD).

### C7 — Upstream Dependencies Are Assumed, Not Declared [F-002]
The Procedure Prerequisites section lists upstream deliverable dependencies (DEL-01-01, DEL-01-06, DEL-01-04) as **ASSUMPTION** rather than confirmed dependencies from `_DEPENDENCIES.md`. This creates a risk that essential process inputs (scope confirmation, site access/logistics plan, permitting timeline) are not formally tracked in the dependency register. The rationale for treating these as assumptions is that `_DEPENDENCIES.md` records "No upstream dependencies declared yet."

**Enrichment [F-002]:** Add rationale in this section explaining why upstream dependencies are assumed rather than declared, and what information inputs the scheduler actually needs before finalizing each schedule artifact:
- **Proposal-stage schedule:** Project scope definition and design milestone sequence (from DEL-01-01 and RFP §7.1.8)
- **Baseline schedule:** Contract clarifications, subcontractor commitments, site access plan (from DEL-01-06), permitting timeline (from DEL-01-04)
- **Monthly updates:** Change Order register, progress data from site supervision

**Source:** _DEPENDENCIES.md; Procedure Prerequisites; _CONTEXT.md.

### C8 — Independent Schedule Review [X-003]
No independent schedule review mechanism (e.g., review by an Owner's scheduler or third-party specialist) is currently included in the verification or procedure steps. The PM/Project Committee reviews the Design-Builder's schedule directly. For a design-build contract of this scale (municipal public services building), direct Owner review may be adequate. However, the absence of independent schedule review should be a conscious decision.

**Enrichment [X-003]:** Add consideration addressing whether an independent schedule review (e.g., by Owner's scheduler or third party) is warranted before baseline acceptance, and rationale for or against. Considerations:
- **For independent review:** Provides objective validation of critical path logic, duration reasonableness, and resource adequacy; reduces risk of accepting an overly optimistic baseline.
- **Against independent review:** Adds cost and schedule overhead to the review cycle; may be disproportionate for a project that is explicitly "not schedule-driven"; the 20 calendar day baseline submission window (REQ-01-02-002) leaves limited time for multi-party review.

This decision is TBD for human determination.

## Trade-offs

### T1 — Schedule Duration vs. Capital Cost
**Tension:** A longer schedule may allow for more competitive subcontractor pricing, off-peak material procurement, and reduced acceleration costs — but increases the Design-Builder's overhead and reduces the Owner's ability to benefit from the new facility sooner.
**Resolution:** The Owner has explicitly prioritized cost-effectiveness over speed (RFP §2.2; OSR §10.2.3). The Design-Builder should optimize for cost, and the schedule narrative should explain how the proposed duration achieves capital cost savings.

### T2 — Schedule Detail vs. Flexibility
**Tension:** A highly detailed schedule provides transparency and accountability but creates rigidity — any minor deviation triggers a formal update. A high-level schedule provides flexibility but may be perceived as vague by the Evaluation Committee.
**Resolution:** ASSUMPTION: For proposal purposes, a schedule showing key work packages and milestones at an appropriate level of detail (Phase/milestone level, not activity level) strikes the right balance. The post-award baseline can be more granular. This is consistent with the RFP framing of "key work packages" and "dates of all milestones."

### T3 — Proposal Schedule Commitment vs. Post-Award Optimization
**Tension:** The proposal schedule forms part of the Contract once agreed. Proposing an aggressive schedule to score well may create contractual risk.
**Resolution:** The scoring matrix rewards demonstrating "understanding of requirements" and "certainty of success" — not the fastest schedule. A credible, realistic, cost-optimized schedule likely scores better than an unrealistically fast one.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority (PROPOSAL) | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-001 | "Project Committee" reviews schedule vs. "Project Manager" accepts/approves baseline — unclear whether these are sequential approval gates (Committee reviews then PM formally accepts) or whether PM acts as the Committee's delegate. [B-004] | Specification REQ-01-02-003 ("Project Committee will review... Once accepted by the Project Manager") | Procedure Step B5 ("Project Committee reviews... Once accepted by the Project Manager") | Specification REQ-01-02-003; Procedure Step B5; Guidance P2 | Guidance.md — recommend clarification that Project Committee review is advisory and Project Manager is the formal acceptance authority, consistent with CCDC 14 contract administration (if confirmed) | TBD |
| CONF-002 | REQ-01-02-007 (Critical Path Narrative) source authority is `_CONTEXT.md` Anticipated Artifacts + ASSUMPTION rather than an explicit RFP clause — normative status unclear. [A-001] | Specification REQ-01-02-007 (source: _CONTEXT.md + ASSUMPTION) | RFP §7.1.9 (requires critical path identification in Gantt but does not explicitly require a separate narrative document) | Specification REQ-01-02-007; Procedure Step A6; Datasheet Construction table | Specification.md — clarify whether separate narrative document is contractually obligated or best-practice guidance | TBD |
| CONF-003 | Cost-optimization verification (REQ-01-02-006) lacks measurable acceptance criteria — reviewer assessment is subjective. No evidence gate confirms schedule actually achieves cost savings. [A-003, E-002] | Specification Verification table REQ-01-02-006 row | Datasheet "Owner schedule-driven? No" attribute; RFP §2.2; OSR §10.2.3 | Specification Verification table; Datasheet Attributes table | Specification.md — Require explicit written rationale documenting cost reduction vs. alternatives, and identification of specific cost-saving scheduling decisions | TBD |
| CONF-004 | Meeting minutes (Procedure Step C4) — unclear whether these belong to DEL-01-02 scope or DEL-01-05 scope. Specification Out of Scope does not mention meeting minutes. [E-001] | Procedure Step C4 (meeting minutes within schedule update cycle) | Specification Out of Scope section (no mention of meeting minutes boundary) | Procedure Step C4; Procedure Records table; Specification Out of Scope | Procedure.md — Clarify whether meeting minutes are part of DEL-01-02 scope or cross-referenced to DEL-01-05 | TBD |

## Examples

**Previous status:** No sample schedules were included in the accessible RFP documents. The decomposition and _CONTEXT.md did not provide example Gantt charts.

**Enrichment [F-003]:** This section now populates examples with representative milestone set and schedule structure description, providing integrated value authority for schedule preparation.

### Representative Milestone Set

The following is a representative milestone structure derived from RFP design milestone sequences and project phases. This is an **ASSUMPTION**-based example and should be treated as the minimum milestone set for scheduling purposes.

**Design Phase Milestones** (per RFP §7.1.8 and §7.3):
1. Building Design Development complete
2. 60% Detailed Design review submission
3. Foundation IFC package issued (if early works are applicable)
4. 100% Building Detail Design complete
5. 100% IFC full package issued

**Permitting Phase Milestones:**
6. Development Permit application submitted
7. Development Permit received
8. Building Permit application submitted
9. Building Permit received

**Construction Phase Milestones:**
10. Site mobilization
11. Foundations complete
12. Structure/framing complete
13. Building envelope closed (weather-tight)
14. MEP rough-in complete
15. Finishes complete

**Commissioning and Closeout Milestones** (per RFP §7.4-§7.5):
16. Commissioning and testing complete
17. Substantial Performance achieved (date proposed by DB per RFP §2.6)
18. Deficiency list issued and resolution complete
19. As-built documentation and O&M manuals delivered
20. Total Completion achieved (date proposed by DB per RFP §2.6)

### Sample Schedule Structure Description

A proposal-stage Gantt chart for this project would typically show:
- **Summary bars** for each phase (Design, Permitting, Construction, Commissioning, Closeout)
- **Detail bars** for key work packages within each phase, showing durations and dependencies
- **Milestone diamonds** for each of the milestones listed above
- **Critical path highlighted** (typically: design completion --> permit receipt --> construction start --> structure --> commissioning --> substantial performance)
- **Float** visible on non-critical activities

**ASSUMPTION:** The critical path for this project is likely governed by the design-to-permit-to-construction sequence, given that the project is not schedule-driven and the Owner encourages schedule flexibility for cost optimization.
