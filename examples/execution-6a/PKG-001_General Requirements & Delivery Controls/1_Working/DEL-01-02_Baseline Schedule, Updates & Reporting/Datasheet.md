## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule format | Gantt Chart | RFP §7.1.9 |
| Baseline submission deadline (post-award) | Within 20 calendar days of contract award | RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control) |
| Update frequency | Monthly | RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control) |
| Update content required | Percentage completion of each Task, including approved Change Orders | RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control) |
| Critical Path identification required | Yes — identified in the Gantt Chart | RFP §7.1.9 |
| Milestone coverage required | Yes — durations of key work packages from Design through Substantial Performance and Close-Out; dates of all milestones | RFP §7.1.9 |
| Progress meeting schedule attachment | Updated schedule showing progress against each milestone, slippage with explanations, and plans for schedule recovery | RFP §7.3.5 |
| Contract incorporation | Proposed schedule, once agreed, forms part of the Contract | RFP §7.1.9 |
| Master Project Schedule | Baseline, once approved, forms part of the Master Project Schedule | RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control) |
| Owner schedule-driven? | No — project is NOT schedule-driven; DB to propose schedule optimizing cost-effectiveness. **Note [E-002]:** No verification mechanism currently defined for confirming that the schedule actually achieves cost savings vs. merely asserting it. Proposed remedy: Require explicit written rationale documenting how schedule duration reduces costs vs. alternatives, and identification of specific cost-saving scheduling decisions (e.g., off-peak procurement, phased mobilization). See Specification REQ-01-02-006 verification and Conflict Table CONF-003. | RFP §2.2; OSR §10.2.3 |
| Submission file format | TBD — RFP specifies "Gantt Chart" format but does not prescribe output file format (PDF, native scheduling file, or both) or file-naming convention. **ASSUMPTION:** standard electronic format acceptable; confirm with Owner. **Enrichment [A-002]:** Add requirement specifying acceptable schedule software output format (e.g., PDF export, native file, or both) and deliverable file-naming convention. | RFP §7.1.9 |
| Evaluation weight | 2 points (out of 100 total) in Project Delivery Plan section. Evaluation criteria: TBD — RFP §8.3 references "understanding of requirements" and "certainty of success" but specific scoring criteria for the 2-point schedule allocation are not elaborated in accessible sources. **Enrichment [C-003]:** Define what "demonstrating commitment to schedule approach" means in observable terms aligned with the 2-point scoring allocation. Recommend establishing quality acceptance criteria (e.g., minimum level of detail, dependency logic completeness, critical path validity check). | RFP §8.2 (Scoring Matrix); RFP §8.3 |

## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule flexibility | Owner strongly encourages DB to leverage schedule flexibility to reduce capital costs or increase value | RFP §2.2 (Background); SOW-0602 |
| Existing facilities operational | Town of Penhold existing Public Works and Firehall facilities remain in operation during project; no hard occupancy deadline imposed | OSR §10.2.3 |
| Owner approval required | Baseline schedule must be reviewed by Project Committee before becoming the formal baseline | RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control) |
| Monthly reporting tied to schedule | Progress/control reports and meeting agendas must include updated schedule data | RFP §7.3.5 |
| Change Orders reflected | Monthly schedule updates must incorporate approved Change Orders | RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control) |
| Addenda impacts on schedule | TBD — Addenda 01-03 contain scope clarifications (e.g., Addendum 03 §1.5 optional 2-storey configuration; §1.6-§1.7 utility tie-in allowance) that may affect schedule assumptions. Review pending. [Lensing B-002] | _REFERENCES.md; Guidance C5 |
