## Requirements

### REQ-01: Site Superintendent -- Continuous Presence
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall provide the specified Site Superintendent for on-site supervision and quality controls for the full duration of the Project.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3; SOW-0010.
**Note:** "Specified" implies the Site Superintendent named/identified in the proposal. ASSUMPTION: substitution of the named Site Superintendent requires Owner notification; specific substitution process is TBD pending contract review. [Lensing ref: A-001]

### REQ-02: Daily Site and Building Cleaning
**Statement:** The Design-Builder and its subcontractors shall clean the site and building daily and secure the site at the end of each workday.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3.1; SOW-0112.
**Acceptance threshold:** TBD -- An objective standard for what constitutes satisfactory daily cleaning (vs. non-conformance) has not been defined in the RFP. The cleaning plan artifact should establish measurable acceptance criteria (e.g., debris removed from active work areas, walkways clear, materials returned to designated storage). **ASSUMPTION: the DB's cleaning plan will define a threshold acceptable to the Owner/PM.** [Lensing ref: A-002]

### REQ-03: Safe and Clean Site -- Barricades and Fencing
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall maintain a safe and clean work site and shall provide barricades and temporary and/or permanent fencing as required throughout construction.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3.1; SOW-0112.

### REQ-04: Final Cleaning
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall complete a final cleaning of the Project site before the final inspection and issuance of Final Payment. Final cleaning shall include removal of all grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, and all other foreign materials from the inside and outside of the building and site.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3.1.
**Acceptance criteria note:** TBD -- The phrase "all other foreign materials" is inherited from the RFP but is ambiguous regarding boundary between foreign material and acceptable residual (e.g., construction adhesive residue, minor surface marks). The cleaning plan should define specific exclusions or acceptance thresholds for final cleaning sign-off. **ASSUMPTION: Owner/PM final inspection will apply a reasonable standard; the DB should propose a definition in the cleaning plan for Owner/PM acceptance.** [Lensing refs: D-002, D-003]

### REQ-05: Logistics and Transportation Responsibility
**Statement:** The Design-Builder is responsible for all logistics and transportation requirements necessary for the successful completion of the project, including proper storage (onsite and offsite) of materials, equipment, and related items.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3.2; SOW-0111.

### REQ-06: Laydown Area Use
**Statement:** The Design-Builder may use the building site and lot as a laydown area for the duration of the project.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3.2; SOW-0111.
**Note:** This is a right/allowance granted to the DB, not a mandate to use all available site area. ASSUMPTION: laydown area extents are subject to coordination with Owner and civil/site work sequencing.

### REQ-07: Offsite Storage
**Statement:** Where onsite storage is insufficient, the Design-Builder shall arrange and bear responsibility for offsite storage of materials and equipment.
**Source:** RFP SS7.3.2 (implied -- "including the proper storage, both onsite and offsite"); SOW-0111.
**Cost assumption:** TBD -- Confirm whether offsite storage costs rest with the Design-Builder or are subject to contract negotiation. Current position is **ASSUMPTION: responsibility for offsite storage costs rests with the Design-Builder unless otherwise agreed in contract.** [Lensing ref: F-001]
**Insurance/liability:** TBD -- The onsite/offsite storage plan should include documentation of insurance/liability coverage for offsite-stored materials. No explicit RFP requirement identified; Guidance Consideration 5 identifies this as a merit threshold. **ASSUMPTION: offsite storage insurance is included in the DB's proposal price.** [Lensing ref: C-003]

### REQ-08: Road Use and Traffic Management (candidate)
**Statement:** TBD -- Where material deliveries require use of or impact adjacent public roads, the Design-Builder shall identify road use/traffic management requirements in the site logistics plan.
**Source:** Procedure.md Step A2 identifies road use/traffic management as an assumption; no explicit RFP requirement found in SS7.3.2 or elsewhere. **ASSUMPTION: if adjacent road use is required, municipal approvals may be needed.** [Lensing ref: B-003]

|---|---|---|
| RFP 2024_004 | Primary contractual document governing all construction phase and administration requirements | Accessible |
| Alberta Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) Act and Regulations | Governs site safety (Prime Contractor obligations); daily cleaning and site security are part of safe site maintenance | TBD -- Confirm applicability to this deliverable's cleaning and site security obligations specifically; currently listed as ASSUMPTION. RFP SS7.2 references Alberta OHS for H&S Plan. [Lensing ref: C-001] |
| CCDC 14-2013 | Contract form; may contain supplementary conditions affecting site supervision and administration obligations | TBD -- Confirm applicability and identify specific relevant clauses affecting site supervision. ASSUMPTION: likely applicable; specific clauses not reviewed. [Lensing ref: A-003] |
| National Master Specification (NMS) format | RFP recommends NMS format for documents | TBD -- Clarify whether NMS format requirement applies to the five plan artifacts produced under this deliverable. RFP SS7.2 Quality Management references NMS but applicability to site plans is unclear. [Lensing ref: C-002] |
