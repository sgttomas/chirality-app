# Guidance: DEL-01-06 Site Supervision, Logistics & Housekeeping

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to demonstrate that the Design-Builder has a credible, organized plan for managing the physical construction site throughout the entire construction phase. It addresses three interdependent domains:

1. **Site Supervision**: The named Site Superintendent is the Design-Builder's primary on-site authority, responsible for day-to-day construction quality, safety, and coordination. Continuous presence signals operational control.
2. **Site Logistics**: The ability to receive, store, and move materials and equipment efficiently is a precondition for on-schedule, on-budget construction. Poor logistics is a common source of cost overruns and schedule slippage.
3. **Housekeeping**: A clean, organized site is a safety requirement, a quality indicator, and a contractual obligation. It also reflects professionalism and reduces liability during the construction period.

## Terminology Note

The following terms are used consistently across this deliverable's four documents. Where variations have appeared in source materials, the canonical form for this deliverable is noted:

| Term | Canonical Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Owner/PM | Used as the verification/acceptance authority throughout all four documents | RFP uses "Owner" in some contexts; this deliverable normalizes to "Owner/PM" to reflect that the Project Manager acts on behalf of the Owner for field-level acceptance. [Lensing ref: B-004] |
| Design-Builder (DB) | "Design-Builder" in formal statements; "DB" as abbreviation in procedural/guidance contexts | Both forms are acceptable; "Design-Builder" is preferred in normative (Specification) language. [Lensing ref: E-003] |

## Principles

### Principle 1: Continuous Supervision -- Not a Delegated Function
The Site Superintendent must be on site for the full duration of the project. This is not a role that can be delegated to a project manager who visits periodically. The RFP specifically requires the "specified" Site Superintendent, meaning the person named in the proposal. Any substitution should be treated as a material change requiring Owner awareness.
Source: RFP SS7.3; SOW-0010.

### Principle 2: Logistics Planning is Front-Loaded
The logistics, laydown, and storage plans should be developed before construction mobilization -- not reactively during construction. Early planning avoids conflicts between material staging and active work areas, prevents double-handling, and reduces the risk of material damage or loss.
Source: RFP SS7.3.2; SOW-0111. ASSUMPTION: sequencing logic for site plans aligns with overall construction schedule baseline.

### Principle 3: Daily Housekeeping is Non-Negotiable
The RFP explicitly requires daily cleaning and end-of-day site securing by both the DB and its subcontractors. This is not aspirational -- it is a contract requirement. Subcontract agreements should include housekeeping obligations to ensure subcontractor compliance, not just DB self-performance.
Source: RFP SS7.3.1; SOW-0112.

### Principle 4: Final Cleaning is a Payment Gate
The final cleaning (removal of all grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, and all other foreign materials from inside and outside) must be completed before final inspection and issuance of Final Payment. Treating this as a gate condition means the DB should plan cleaning as a distinct final-phase activity, not an afterthought.
Source: RFP SS7.3.1.

### Principle 5: Laydown Area is a Resource, Not a Guarantee
The RFP states the site and lot are "available" for laydown -- this is a DB right, not an unconditional reservation. As construction progresses and the building footprint is established, available laydown area will shrink. The laydown/staging plan should account for phased reductions in available area.
Source: RFP SS7.3.2. ASSUMPTION: coordination with civil/site works (DEL-03 package) is needed to avoid conflicts between laydown zones and active civil construction areas.

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Interface with H&S Plan (DEL-01-03)
Site cleaning, fencing, and barricades are both housekeeping and H&S requirements. The site supervision deliverable must be consistent with the H&S Plan in terms of site access control, barricade placement, and hazard identification. The two deliverables should cross-reference each other.
Source: RFP SS7.2, SS7.3.1; SOW-0008 (H&S Plan scope), SOW-0112.

### Consideration 2: Interface with Civil/Site Works (PKG-003)
The laydown/staging area plan must be coordinated with civil grading, utility, and pavement work (PKG-003 deliverables). If the laydown area overlaps with civil construction zones, sequencing conflicts can arise. The logistics plan should identify which site areas are available during each project phase.

**Coordination mechanism:** TBD -- The mechanism by which laydown/staging plan coordination with PKG-003 civil works is formalized has not been defined. Options include: interface agreement, joint review session, or schedule linkage through DEL-01-02 baseline schedule. **ASSUMPTION: coordination will be achieved through a combination of joint plan review and construction schedule alignment (PKG-003 civil work will mobilize in proximity to or on the same ~20-acre parcel).** [Lensing ref: D-001]

Source: RFP SS7.3.2; Decomposition PKG-003 scope (site/civil works package).

### Consideration 3: Subcontractor Cleaning Obligations
The RFP jointly obligates the Design-Builder and subcontractors for daily cleaning. This means the DB's cleaning plan must establish how subcontractor compliance is monitored and enforced. A daily site walkthrough protocol or end-of-day checklist signed by the site superintendent is one practical approach.

**Escalation:** The cleaning plan should also define an escalation path for subcontractor housekeeping non-compliance (e.g., verbal warning, written notice, correction at subcontractor's cost, back-charge). See Procedure Part B for the corresponding procedural steps. [Lensing ref: A-004]

Source: RFP SS7.3.1.

### Consideration 4: Barricade and Fencing Phasing
The fencing/barricades plan should address phased requirements -- for example, initial site perimeter security at mobilization, evolving barricade needs as work fronts open, and removal/replacement of temporary fencing with permanent fencing as required at project completion.
Source: RFP SS7.3.1; SOW-0112. ASSUMPTION: permanent perimeter fencing (if required) will be identified in the civil/site scope; temporary fencing during construction is a DB-supplied logistics item.

### Consideration 5: Offsite Storage Security and Accessibility
Where offsite storage is used, the DB retains responsibility for the security and condition of stored materials. Damage or loss of offsite-stored materials is not a risk that transfers to the Owner. The onsite/offsite storage plan should identify offsite facility location(s), access arrangements, and insurance/liability coverage.
Source: RFP SS7.3.2; SOW-0111. **ASSUMPTION: offsite storage costs and insurance are included in the DB's proposal price.**

### Consideration 6: Site Superintendent Qualifications
TBD -- REQ-01 requires the "specified Site Superintendent" and the Datasheet records the role as "on-site, full duration," but no document defines what qualifications or experience the Site Superintendent should possess to satisfy "specified" and "qualified" expectations beyond being named in the proposal. The DB should consider documenting the Superintendent's relevant experience, certifications, and project-type familiarity as part of the plan package or proposal. **ASSUMPTION: the RFP evaluation criteria (if applicable) may address qualifications; this is a gap in the construction-phase specification.** [Lensing ref: X-001]

### Consideration 7: Plan Package Acceptance Process
TBD -- Procedure Prerequisites require "All five plan artifacts approved or accepted" before construction mobilization, but no document explains the acceptance mechanism. Questions to resolve include: who signs off (Owner, PM, or both), what constitutes formal acceptance (written acknowledgment, review comment closure, or formal transmittal receipt), and whether acceptance is per-artifact or for the package as a whole. **ASSUMPTION: Owner/PM written acknowledgment of each artifact constitutes acceptance.** [Lensing ref: E-001]

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Onsite vs Offsite Storage
**Tension:** Maximizing onsite storage reduces transport cost and handling time, but consuming the entire laydown area early can conflict with active construction operations.
**Resolution:** A phased storage plan that transitions from maximum onsite usage during early structure/foundation work to greater offsite reliance during interior fit-out (when site area is constrained by the building footprint) is the practical approach.
**Rationale:** Balances cost efficiency against construction workflow. No explicit RFP guidance on the balance; this is a DB design decision.
Source: RFP SS7.3.2. **ASSUMPTION.**

### Trade-off 2: Temporary vs Permanent Fencing
**Tension:** Permanent fencing provides longer-term security and avoids repeated temporary installation/removal costs, but may be incompatible with evolving site access needs during construction.
**Resolution:** Temporary fencing should be used where site access patterns will change during construction; permanent fencing should be installed in locations where the final configuration is established.
**Rationale:** The RFP allows either "temporary and/or permanent fencing" -- giving the DB flexibility to use judgment. The DB should not default to all-temporary if permanent fencing is a final facility requirement.
Source: RFP SS7.3.1. **ASSUMPTION: final permanent fencing scope and location determined by site plan (DEL-03-01).**

## Quality Indicators for Site Logistics Performance

TBD -- No document currently identifies measurable quality indicators for evaluating how well site logistics and housekeeping are performing during construction. The following are candidate metrics for consideration:

- **Delivery delay rate**: Percentage of scheduled material deliveries arriving outside the planned window.
- **Laydown zone utilization**: Percentage of designated laydown area in active use vs. available capacity.
- **Cleaning non-conformance rate**: Number of daily cleaning non-conformances documented per week/month.
- **Offsite storage retrieval time**: Average time from request to material availability on site.

These are **ASSUMPTION (illustrative candidates)**; the DB should select and baseline metrics appropriate to project scale and complexity. [Lensing ref: F-004]

## Examples

### Example 1: Daily Cleaning Protocol (illustrative -- ASSUMPTION)
A practical daily cleaning protocol might include:
- Each subcontractor responsible for cleaning its own work area at end of shift.
- Site Superintendent or designate conducts end-of-day walkthrough with checklist.
- Any non-conformance documented and remediated before next day's work begins.
- **Escalation for repeat non-compliance:** First occurrence: verbal notice. Second occurrence: written notice to subcontractor. Third occurrence: DB performs cleaning and back-charges subcontractor. [Lensing ref: A-004]
This reflects RFP SS7.3.1 intent; specific protocol is DB's design choice. **ASSUMPTION.**

### Example 2: Laydown Zone Phasing (illustrative -- ASSUMPTION)
- **Phase 1 (Mobilization/Earthworks)**: Full site perimeter available; laydown near site entrance.
- **Phase 2 (Structure)**: Reduce laydown as building footprint established; offsite storage for long-lead materials.
- **Phase 3 (Interior Fit-Out)**: Offsite storage for bulky materials; onsite staging limited to active trade areas.
**ASSUMPTION: phasing aligns with construction schedule baseline (DEL-01-02).**
