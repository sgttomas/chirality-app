# Deliverable: DEL-01-06 Site Supervision, Logistics & Housekeeping

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the Design-Builder's framework for continuous on-site supervisory authority, material logistics and storage management, and daily housekeeping throughout the construction phase. It must carry knowledge of how physical site control -- through personnel presence, material flow coordination, cleaning discipline, and perimeter security -- enables safe, orderly, and contractually compliant construction operations from mobilization through final payment.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
