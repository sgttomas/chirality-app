## Prerequisites

### For Plan Production (Part A)
- Construction schedule baseline (DEL-01-02) -- needed to sequence logistics phasing and cleaning milestones.
- Site plan and civil works scope (PKG-003 deliverables, particularly DEL-03-01 Site Plan) -- needed to identify available laydown zones and civil construction sequencing.
- H&S Plan (DEL-01-03) -- cleaning and barricade requirements must be consistent with H&S Plan.
- Named Site Superintendent confirmed for proposal.
- Knowledge of offsite storage options/locations available to the DB (if onsite laydown is insufficient).

### For Construction Phase Execution (Part B)
- All five plan artifacts approved or accepted by Owner/PM prior to or at construction mobilization. **Note:** This prerequisite is also a formal verification gate -- see Verification table. [Lensing ref: F-003]
- Subcontract agreements in place including housekeeping obligations for all subcontractors.
- Fencing and barricade materials procured and staged.
- Daily cleaning checklist/log template established.

## Steps

### Part A -- Producing the Plan Artifacts

**Step A1: Review RFP Requirements and Decomposition Scope**
Review RFP SS7.3, SS7.3.1, and SS7.3.2. Confirm scope items SOW-0010, SOW-0111, and SOW-0112 are fully addressed. Note that the five plan artifacts address these three scope items collectively.
Output: internal requirements checklist.

**Step A2: Develop Site Logistics Plan**
Based on the project location (~20-acre parcel, Town of Penhold) and the anticipated construction sequence:
- Identify site access points and haul routes for material deliveries.
- Identify sequencing of trade mobilizations (civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, etc.).
- Coordinate logistics plan with civil/site construction sequence (PKG-003).
- Identify any road use/traffic management requirements for access to site (ASSUMPTION: if adjacent road use is required, municipal approvals may be needed). [Lensing ref: B-003]
Output: Site logistics plan document.

**Step A3: Develop Laydown/Staging Plan**
- Identify available laydown zones on the building site and lot. Note: total parcel is ~20 acres with ~12 acres developable; usable laydown area per phase is TBD (see Datasheet). [Lensing ref: B-001]
- Phase laydown zone availability against construction schedule (shrinks as building footprint and civil work advance).
- Designate zones for: structural materials, MEP materials, equipment, subcontractor trailers/temporary facilities.
- Confirm laydown plan does not conflict with civil grading, utility, and pavement work (DEL-03 package coordination).
Output: Laydown/staging plan drawing or diagram.

**Step A4: Develop Temporary Fencing/Barricades Plan**
- Identify perimeter fencing requirement at mobilization for site security.
- Identify interior barricade requirements for active work zones, openings, and hazardous areas.
- Distinguish between temporary fencing (removed at end of construction) and permanent fencing (if required as part of final site configuration).
- Coordinate with H&S Plan (DEL-01-03) for required barricade locations per hazard assessment.
Output: Temporary fencing/barricades plan drawing or diagram.

**Step A5: Develop Cleaning Plan**
- Document daily cleaning protocol: responsibilities (DB and subcontractors), scope (site and building), timing (end of each workday), and site securing procedure.
- Define measurable acceptance threshold for daily cleaning compliance (see Specification REQ-02). [Lensing ref: A-002]
- Document final cleaning scope: all grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, and all other foreign materials from inside and outside of building and site (per RFP SS7.3.1).
- Define boundary for "all other foreign materials" in final cleaning scope (see Specification REQ-04). [Lensing ref: D-003]
- Identify trigger for final cleaning (prior to final inspection and issuance of Final Payment).
- Establish non-conformance response and escalation protocol (if daily cleaning obligation is not met by a subcontractor) -- see Guidance Consideration 3 and Example 1 for escalation path. [Lensing ref: A-004]
Output: Cleaning plan document.

**Step A6: Develop Onsite/Offsite Storage Plan**
- List categories of materials/equipment requiring storage throughout construction.
- Identify environmental/weather protection requirements for stored materials (temperature-sensitive, moisture-sensitive categories). [Lensing ref: B-002]
- Assign each category to onsite or offsite storage, with rationale (space, security, environmental sensitivity).
- For offsite storage: identify facility location(s), access arrangements, insurance/security coverage.
- Phase storage plan against construction schedule -- update storage assignments as project advances.
Output: Onsite/offsite storage plan document.

**Step A7: Internal Review and Cross-Check**
- Confirm all five plan artifacts are consistent with each other (no conflicting zone assignments or sequencing conflicts).
- Confirm consistency with construction schedule (DEL-01-02), site plan (DEL-03-01), and H&S Plan (DEL-01-03).
- Confirm named Site Superintendent is reflected in all relevant artifacts.
Output: Reviewed and finalized plan package.

### Part B -- Construction Phase Execution

**Step B1: Mobilization -- Implement Plans**
- Install site perimeter fencing/barricades per Temporary Fencing/Barricades Plan before any construction activities begin.
- Establish laydown zones per Laydown/Staging Plan; install signage identifying zones.
- Brief all subcontractors on cleaning plan obligations; confirm subcontract housekeeping requirements are understood.
- Commence daily cleaning log.

**Step B2: Ongoing -- Daily Supervision and Housekeeping**
- Site Superintendent performs daily site supervision for quality controls throughout the full construction duration.
- Site Superintendent or designate conducts end-of-day site walkthrough; confirms cleaning completed by all trades; confirms site is secured.
- Daily cleaning log entry completed each workday.
- Non-conformances (e.g., subcontractor area not cleaned) documented and remediated before next workday.
- **Escalation for subcontractor non-compliance:** Apply the escalation path defined in the cleaning plan (e.g., verbal warning, written notice, correction at subcontractor's cost, back-charge). Document each escalation step. [Lensing ref: A-004]

**Step B3: Ongoing -- Logistics and Storage Management**
- Coordinate incoming material deliveries against logistics plan; avoid unplanned accumulation in active construction zones.
- Update laydown/staging plan as construction progresses and available area changes.
- Monitor offsite storage facility (if in use) for security and material condition.

**Step B4: Ongoing -- Fencing and Barricade Updates**
- Update fencing/barricade locations as construction phases change (new work fronts open, hazards evolve).
- Remove temporary fencing from areas no longer requiring it; install in new hazardous areas as needed.

**Step B5: Pre-Final Inspection -- Final Cleaning**
- Trigger final cleaning operation before scheduling final inspection.
- Final cleaning scope: all grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, and all other foreign materials removed from inside and outside of all buildings and site areas.
- DB performs final walkthrough with checklist prior to inviting Owner/PM for final inspection.
- Document final cleaning completion date.

---

### Part C -- Closeout

**Step C1: Close Out Site Supervision, Logistics, and Housekeeping Obligations**
- Confirm all temporary fencing and barricades have been removed or handed over to Owner as permanent installations per the fencing/barricades plan.
- Confirm all laydown areas have been restored to the condition required by the contract or site plan (e.g., cleared, graded, or paved per DEL-03 scope).
- Confirm all offsite storage locations have been vacated and any offsite storage agreements have been closed out.
- Archive all cleaning records, daily logs, and non-conformance records.
- Confirm Site Superintendent obligations are formally concluded (or transitioned to warranty-period support per DEL-01-07).
- Obtain Owner/PM acknowledgment that site supervision, logistics, and housekeeping obligations are complete.
Output: Closeout confirmation record. [Lensing ref: E-002]
