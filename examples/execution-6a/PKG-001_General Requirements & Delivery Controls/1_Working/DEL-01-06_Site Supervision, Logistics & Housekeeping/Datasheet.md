## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Site Superintendent role | On-site, full duration of project | RFP SS7.3 |
| Supervision scope | On-site supervision and quality controls | RFP SS7.3; SOW-0010 |
| Daily cleaning frequency | Daily (site and building); secure site at end of each workday | RFP SS7.3.1 |
| Final cleaning trigger | Before final inspection and issuance of Final Payment | RFP SS7.3.1 |
| Final cleaning scope | Removal of all grease, stains, labels, fingerprints, dust, dirt, and all other foreign materials from inside and outside | RFP SS7.3.1 |
| Site fencing / barricades | Temporary and/or permanent fencing/barricades as required | RFP SS7.3.1; SOW-0112 |
| Logistics responsibility | All logistics and transportation requirements necessary for successful project completion | RFP SS7.3.2; SOW-0111 |
| Storage scope | Proper storage both onsite and offsite of materials, equipment, etc. | RFP SS7.3.2; SOW-0111 |
| Laydown area availability | Building site and lot available to DB as laydown area for duration of project | RFP SS7.3.2 |
| Usable laydown area (by phase) | TBD -- Total parcel is ~20 acres; ~12 acres developable (remainder is storm retention pond and dog park in flood fringe). Usable laydown area per construction phase not yet quantified. | Decomposition Phase 1 Intake (SOW-0102); Addendum 03 SS1.1. **ASSUMPTION: usable laydown area will decrease as building footprint and civil work advance.** [Lensing ref: B-001] |
| Environmental/weather protection for stored materials | TBD -- Categories of temperature-sensitive and moisture-sensitive materials requiring special storage protection not yet identified. | Procedure.md Step A6 (references environmental sensitivity as a storage rationale); no supporting data in RFP SS7.3.2 or Datasheet sources. [Lensing ref: B-002] |

## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Project setting | New integrated Public Services Building (Fire + Public Works) + unheated cold storage building; approximately 20-acre parcel (~12 acres developable) | Decomposition Phase 1 Intake; Addendum 03 SS1.1 |
| Operational context | Design-Build delivery; Site Superintendent must be on site throughout construction phase | RFP SS7.3; SOW-0010 |
| Schedule flexibility | Project is not schedule-driven; DB may leverage schedule flexibility to optimize cost/value | Decomposition OBJ-008 note; SOW-0602 |
| H&S relationship | Site supervision operates within H&S plan framework (Prime Contractor obligations per Alberta OHS) | RFP SS7.2 |
| Cleaning subcontractor obligation | Design-Builder and subcontractors jointly responsible for daily cleaning | RFP SS7.3.1 |
