## Steps

### Phase A — Produce Proposal Design Brief

**Step A-1: Review and Parse All RFP Documents**

1. Read RFP 2024_004 in full, with particular attention to §7.1 (Design Methodology), §7.1.1 (Proposed Conceptual Design), and §7.1.2 (Design Brief sub-sections).
2. Read all three Addenda (01, 02, 03) and document scope changes; verify Addendum acknowledgment requirements.
3. Read OSR (Appendix A) and Functional Program (Appendix B) to establish Owner's design requirements.
4. Compile a brief requirements matrix linking each RFP/OSR requirement to the applicable Design Brief section.

**Source:** RFP §4.1; §7.1; §2.9.

**Step A-2: Review Site and Technical Reference Documents**

1. Review Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) for site conditions relevant to structural and foundation narrative.
2. Review Site Grading drawings (Appendix E) for building location, orientation, and grading context.
3. Review Site Plan (Appendix F) for site boundary, access points, and existing conditions.
4. Flag any site conditions that affect design approach narratives (record as ASSUMPTION if geotechnical data is interpreted rather than directly quoted).

**Source:** RFP §2.3; §12.9–§12.11.

**Step A-3: Develop Conceptual Design Basis**

1. Develop a conceptual design approach for the main PSB building integrating Fire Department and Public Works operations per OSR §10.2.
2. Confirm cold storage building size as 60' × 100' clear-span (per Addendum 03; DEC-001).
3. Identify the structural system basis for the main building (considering 50-year design life, solar-ready roof, expansion potential per OSR §10.2; SOW-0201; SOW-0221).
4. Develop site plan concept addressing circulation, parking, turning radii, access to Waskasoo Avenue, and yard areas per OSR §10.3.1 and SOW-0101.
5. Prepare dimensioned drawings (site plan, floor plan, elevations) sufficient to communicate building size and configuration.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.1; OSR §10.2–§10.3 (location TBD for specific OSR clause text).

**Step A-4: Draft Five Discipline Design Briefs**

Draft each discipline Design Brief section as follows:

| Brief | Key Content | RFP Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Architectural | Site plan, architectural plan, exterior elevations | §7.1.2.1 |
| Civil | Building, parking, street access, services, drainage | §7.1.2.2 |
| Structural | Structural solution (cost, flexibility, expansion) | §7.1.2.3 |
| Mechanical | Main mechanical systems (HVAC, plumbing, exhaust) | §7.1.2.4 |
| Electrical/IT | Power distribution, lighting, controls, comms, access control | §7.1.2.5 |

Also include supplementary narratives as required:
- Accessibility (Alberta Building Code compliance per §7.1.3)
- Building Durability / Ease of Repair and Maintenance (§7.1.4)
- Adaptability, Flexibility, and Potential for Expansion (§7.1.5)

**Step A-5: Assemble and QA the Proposal Design Brief**

1. Compile all discipline briefs, conceptual drawings, and supplementary narratives into a single structured document.
2. Verify all Addendum changes (01, 02, 03) are reflected in the narratives.
3. Verify document is under 15 MB in PDF format. If approaching the limit, optimize drawings or consult RFP Authority regarding split-file approach (see Conflict Table CON-01-01-001 in Guidance.md).
4. Obtain internal design review against the RFP §7.1 checklist before submission.
5. Confirm authorized signature on Proposal (Appendix G — Letter of Offer) per RFP §5.2 and §6.1.

**Source:** RFP §4.1–§4.2; §5.2; §6.1.

**Step A-6: Submit Proposal**

Submit the Proposal by email to Sean Pendergast, Project Manager, Town of Penhold (spendergast@townofpenhold.ca) before August 30, 2024, 14:00:00 MST.

**Source:** RFP §5.3.

5. Confirm all Alberta-registered professionals are identified and have valid registrations.
6. Document the prerequisite confirmation in writing (e.g., Phase B readiness memo) and retain as a project record.

> **Note:** This step addresses the Governing Readiness Imperative and Mandatory Execution Readiness gaps (lensing items X-001, X-003). The Phase B prerequisites table lists required items but previously had no explicit verification mechanism. Source: DB PM responsibility; contractual requirements.

**Step B-1: Establish Design Management Framework (within 20 calendar days of contract award)**

1. Confirm design team structure (PM, Discipline Leads, Sub-consultants) with Owner.
2. Establish and distribute the Design Coordination Matrix (template) to all discipline leads.
   - Matrix to cover: discipline, interface items, responsible party, status, review date.
   - **ASSUMPTION:** specific format to be proposed by DB; confirm with Owner.
3. Establish QA/QC Design Review Checklist template aligned with RFP §7 requirements and OSR.
4. Agree with the Project Manager on design milestone dates and Owner review window durations.
5. Integrate design milestones into Baseline Schedule (DEL-01-02).

**Source:** RFP §7.1; §7.2 (Quality Mgmt); SOW-0007 (schedule baseline within 20 days of award).

**Step B-2: Building Design Development (DD) Submission**

1. Advance conceptual design from Proposal to DD level across all disciplines.
2. Update Design Coordination Matrix; resolve all known inter-discipline conflicts before submission.
3. Complete QA/QC Design Review Checklist — verify conformance with RFP §7.1.2 and OSR.
4. Obtain Alberta-registered professional review; confirm sealing requirements for DD stage.
5. Assemble and submit DD package to Owner/Project Committee.

4. Apply all required professional seals to IFC documents.
5. Submit 100% IFC full package to Owner; confirm acceptance.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8; SOW-0006.

**Step B-7: Ongoing Design Coordination**

Throughout all design phases:

1. Update Design Coordination Matrix after each discipline design advancement or when new interface issues are identified.
2. Chair or participate in design coordination meetings as required (coordinate with meeting records under DEL-01-05).
3. Track and respond to Owner RFIs or design clarifications.
4. Ensure design changes are evaluated for impact on schedule and budget (coordinate with DEL-01-02 and DEL-01-05 change control process).
5. Apply the design change control process (REQ-01-01-015 in Specification) for design changes arising between milestones: propose, evaluate impact, obtain approval before incorporation into the next milestone package.

**Source:** RFP §7.1; §7.3; SOW-0004; SOW-0011–SOW-0012; REQ-01-01-015.

**Step B-8: Periodic Regulatory and Contractual Compliance Audit (lensing item A-004)**

At each milestone (minimum), the DB PM shall conduct a compliance audit to confirm the design management system continues to meet contractual and RFP obligations:

1. Verify that the Design Coordination Matrix is current and adequately covers all active inter-discipline interfaces.
2. Verify that QA/QC Design Review Checklists are being completed and filed per the established process.
3. Verify that Owner review comment resolution is being tracked and documented per the standardized process (see Terminology Notes in Guidance.md, lensing item E-002).
