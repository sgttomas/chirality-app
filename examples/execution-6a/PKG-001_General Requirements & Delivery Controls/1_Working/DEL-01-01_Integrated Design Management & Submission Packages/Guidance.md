# Guidance: DEL-01-01 Integrated Design Management & Submission Packages

## Purpose

DEL-01-01 exists to establish and govern the **integrated design management system** that coordinates all design disciplines from proposal through Issued for Construction (IFC). It is the primary mechanism through which the Design-Builder demonstrates:

1. A credible, organized approach to multi-disciplinary design delivery;
2. Collaborative engagement with the Town of Penhold's Project Committee;
3. Quality assurance across all design phases;
4. Traceability from Owner requirements (OSR, RFP) through to construction documents.

The Proposal Design Brief component of this deliverable is evaluated by the Owner's Evaluation Committee as part of proposal assessment — it is therefore both a contractual and competitive instrument. The milestone submission packages are post-award deliverables that govern the pace and quality of design execution.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Clarity Over Complexity

The RFP explicitly states the Evaluation Committee may not be expert in all design disciplines. Design briefs must be clear, concise, and comprehensive — not technically dense. Jargon should be explained.

**Source:** RFP §4.1 (General Submission Format and Content).

### Principle 2: Owner Collaboration is a Deliverable, Not a Courtesy

The RFP requires the Design-Builder to "facilitate a collaborative design process with the Owner and stakeholders, including review/approval timelines and municipal permitting process sequencing." Collaboration is a contractual obligation built into every milestone.

**Source:** RFP §7.1; SOW-0004.

### Principle 3: Quality Management is the Design-Builder's Responsibility

The Design-Builder bears full responsibility for ensuring all designs comply with the Alberta Building Code, NBCC, and AHJ requirements. The Owner does not share QA/QC responsibility. The Design-Builder's quality management approach must be articulated in the Proposal.

**Source:** RFP §7.2.

### Principle 4: Design Flexibility is Valued

The Owner is "amenable to various options for the design," encouraging cost-effective and innovative solutions. The milestone submission structure accommodates design evolution between DD and IFC. The design management system should be structured to support — not constrain — design optimization.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.1; RFP §2.2 (project is NOT schedule-driven); SOW-0602.

### Principle 5: Professional Accountability

All required documents must be sealed by Alberta-registered professionals. This is a non-negotiable condition of the CCDC 14-2013 contract. The design coordination system must track which professionals are responsible for which elements.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.2.

## Considerations

### Consideration 1: Proposal Design Brief is Pre-Award and Evaluated

The Proposal Design Brief is submitted before contract award and is scored as part of the RFP evaluation. It must strike a balance between sufficient detail to demonstrate design competence and appropriate scope given the proposal stage. Over-specifying design details before site surveys and geotechnical data are integrated may create risk.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.1; §8.2–§8.3 (Evaluation Criteria and Scoring Matrix — specific scoring weights: location TBD, scoring matrix page reference not confirmed in pages reviewed).

> **TBD (lensing item A-006):** What are the Owner's evaluation scoring weights for the Proposal Design Brief? Without these, the relative emphasis to place on different Design Brief sections cannot be calibrated. Confirm by reviewing RFP §8.2–§8.3 (Evaluation Criteria). Source: RFP Authority.

### Consideration 2: Milestone Sequencing and Owner Review Time

Each design milestone submission must include time for Owner review and resubmission. The design program should build in Owner review windows at each stage. Failing to do so creates schedule pressure and risks non-compliant submissions.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8 ("including time for review and resubmission").

### Consideration 3: Foundation IFC is Conditional

The "Foundation IFC (if needed)" milestone is explicitly conditional. Whether it is required will depend on the Design-Builder's construction sequencing strategy. If early foundation work is planned to optimize schedule (leveraging the Owner's schedule flexibility), the Foundation IFC must be prepared and reviewed before foundation construction commences.

**Source:** RFP §7.1.8; RFP §2.2 (schedule flexibility); SOW-0602.

### Consideration 4: Design Coordination Matrix Format is Not Prescribed

The RFP does not prescribe a format for the design coordination matrix. The Design-Builder should propose a format suited to the project's discipline complexity. Common approaches include discipline-by-discipline interface tables, BIM coordination logs, or RFI-linked matrices.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — RFP does not prescribe format; based on _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact and industry practice.

**Comparative Assessment of Format Alternatives (lensing item C-003):**

| Format Option | Strengths | Limitations | Suitability for This Project |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discipline Interface Table | Simple; clear responsibility assignment; easy to audit at milestones | May not capture temporal coordination needs; static between updates | Well suited for 6-discipline project of moderate complexity; aligns with milestone-gated review structure |
| BIM Coordination Log | Real-time clash detection; integrates with 3D model workflow | Requires BIM adoption across all disciplines; higher setup cost; RFP does not mandate BIM | Suitable if DB adopts BIM workflow; overkill if design is primarily 2D CAD. **ASSUMPTION:** BIM adoption not confirmed |
| RFI-Linked Matrix | Ties coordination to formal communication trail; audit-friendly | Reactive (captures issues after they arise, not proactively); may miss interfaces without RFIs | Useful as supplementary tool but insufficient as primary coordination mechanism for proactive interface management |

> **ASSUMPTION:** A tiered approach (high-level discipline interface table + discipline-specific sub-registers) is recommended per Trade-off 3. The DB discipline leads and Owner should confirm preferred format at the Step B-1 design management framework establishment (Procedure). Source: Industry practice; project scope complexity (6 disciplines per SOW-0003).

### Consideration 5: QA/QC Checklist Content Must Align With Evaluation Criteria

The QA/QC design review checklists should be structured to verify conformance with the specific requirements of the RFP §7 (Project Delivery Plan) and OSR (Appendix A). Generic checklists not tailored to this project reduce their value as conformance evidence.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — based on RFP §7.2 (Quality Mgmt) and the need for RFP-specific conformance.

**Minimum Content Framework (lensing item E-003):** The following categories are recommended as minimum content for QA/QC Design Review Checklists. This framework ensures absolute quality accounting by covering each obligation domain:

1. **RFP Compliance:** Each RFP §7.1.2 discipline requirement checked against submission content.
2. **OSR Compliance:** Each applicable OSR section checked against design response.
3. **Code Compliance:** Confirmation that design elements satisfy ABC, NBCC, and applicable AHJ requirements (noting which specific codes apply — see Standards table in Specification).
4. **Addenda Incorporation:** Confirmation that all Addenda 01–03 changes are reflected.
5. **Coordination Completeness:** Confirmation that all inter-discipline interfaces in the Design Coordination Matrix are resolved or tracked with open-item disposition.
6. **Professional Seal Readiness:** Confirmation that all documents requiring seals are identified and sealed by the appropriate Alberta-registered professional.
7. **Supplementary Narrative Coverage:** Confirmation that Accessibility (§7.1.3), Durability (§7.1.4), and Adaptability (§7.1.5) narratives are present and adequate (see REQ-01-01-014 in Specification).

> **ASSUMPTION:** Specific checklist items within each category are the DB quality lead's responsibility to develop. This framework establishes the minimum category coverage. Source: RFP §7.2; REQ-01-01-013; industry practice.

### Consideration 6: Addenda Must Be Reflected in Design Briefs

Three addenda were issued during the RFP period. The Proposal Design Brief must acknowledge and incorporate all addenda (Addenda 01, 02, 03). Addendum 03 in particular contains significant scope changes (cold storage size, bay sumps, gear lockers, generator backup, etc.) that must be reflected in the design approach narrative.

**Source:** RFP §2.9 (Addenda); Decomposition (Addendum 03 references throughout SSOW).

### Consideration 7: 20-Calendar-Day Framework Establishment Window — Rationale and Risk

Procedure Step B-1 specifies that the Design Management Framework must be established "within 20 calendar days of contract award." This timeline derives from SOW-0007 (baseline schedule requirement: "within 20 days of award").

**Rationale (lensing item B-004):** The 20-day window is contractually driven (SOW-0007). It is appropriate because:
- It aligns with the baseline schedule establishment timeline, ensuring design management infrastructure is in place before the first formal milestone.
- It provides sufficient time for design team mobilization, coordination matrix template development, and Owner alignment on review windows.

**Risk if not met:** Failure to establish the design management framework within 20 calendar days creates:
- Delay in setting Owner-agreed milestone review windows (Consideration 2), compressing later review cycles.
- Risk that the coordination matrix and QA/QC checklist templates are not in place before design work commences, undermining quality tracking from the outset.
- Potential contractual non-compliance with SOW-0007.

> **ASSUMPTION:** The 20-day deadline is firm per SOW-0007. The DB PM should treat this as a critical-path mobilization activity. Source: SOW-0007; RFP §7.1; contractual requirements.

### Consideration 8: Independent Design Review at Key Milestones

Under the Critical Oversight Requirement lens (lensing item X-005), all review mechanisms described in the current documents are either internal to the DB team or conducted by the Owner. No consideration is given to independent third-party design review.

For design-build projects of this scale and public-use nature (Public Services Building — fire department and public works), independent design review at key milestones (particularly 100% DD and IFC) is common industry practice to:
- Provide an objective quality check independent of the DB's commercial interests;
- Satisfy AHJ or insurance requirements that may exist;
- Strengthen the Owner's confidence in design adequacy.

**TBD:** Confirm whether independent third-party design review is required by contract, AHJ, or Owner preference. If not contractually required, the DB should consider whether to propose it as a value-added service. Source: DB PM / Owner; CCDC 14-2013 (not accessible — cannot confirm if it requires independent review); AHJ requirements.

### Consideration 6: Addenda Must Be Reflected in Design Briefs

Three addenda were issued during the RFP period. The Proposal Design Brief must acknowledge and incorporate all addenda (Addenda 01, 02, 03). Addendum 03 in particular contains significant scope changes (cold storage size, bay sumps, gear lockers, generator backup, etc.) that must be reflected in the design approach narrative.

**Source:** RFP §2.9 (Addenda); Decomposition (Addendum 03 references throughout SSOW).

**Material Scope Changes from Addendum 03 (lensing item B-003):** The following Addendum 03 scope changes affect the design management strategy and must be explicitly addressed:

- Cold storage building: size confirmed at 60' × 100' clear-span, unheated construction (DEC-001).
- Apparatus bays: bay sumps added for drainage/service access (affects drainage narrative).
- Gear lockers: specified storage (affects floor plan and layout).
- Generator backup power: included in electrical systems (affects electrical design brief and single-line diagrams).

Confirm in the Proposal Design Brief that all these changes are incorporated and that any scope ambiguities from earlier addenda are resolved. The DB PM should maintain a change log reconciling Addenda 01–03 against the final Design Brief to demonstrate thoroughness.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Proposal Design Brief Depth vs. Proposal Risk

- **Tension:** More detailed design briefs better demonstrate competence but may commit the Design-Builder to solutions before full due diligence (geotechnical, site survey, etc.).
- **Resolution:** Design Briefs at proposal stage should clearly articulate the design approach and rationale while flagging areas where post-award investigations may refine the solution. Premature commitment to specific dimensions or systems should be avoided.
- **Source:** RFP §7.1.1; §2.3 (Existing Reports, Studies — geotechnical report provided but site-specific verification expected post-award).

### Trade-off 2: Design Milestone Frequency vs. Design Velocity

- **Tension:** More structured review milestones provide Owner confidence but interrupt design momentum and require Owner bandwidth.
- **Resolution:** The RFP prescribes exactly five milestones (DD, 60%, Foundation IFC if needed, 100% DD, 100% IFC). The Design-Builder should not propose fewer, but may propose interim check-ins to reduce revision risk at formal milestones.
- **Source:** RFP §7.1.8.

### Trade-off 3: Standardized Coordination vs. Discipline-Specific Needs

- **Tension:** A single design coordination matrix format is easier to manage but may not capture discipline-specific interface risks (e.g., mechanical-structural penetrations vs. electrical-IT routing).
- **Resolution:** A tiered coordination matrix — high-level interface table supported by discipline-specific sub-registers — balances manageability with thoroughness.
- **Source:** ASSUMPTION — based on project scope complexity (SOW-0003: six disciplines) and _CONTEXT.md.

## Terminology Notes

### "Design Brief" Vocabulary (lensing item F-003)

Across the four DEL-01-01 documents, the following terms are used:
- **"Proposal Design Brief"** — the umbrella document submitted with the RFP response, containing all discipline narratives and supplementary narratives.
- **"Design Brief -- [Discipline]"** (e.g., "Design Brief -- Architectural") — a discipline-specific section within the Proposal Design Brief.
- **"Design Brief"** (unqualified) — used throughout to refer to the Proposal Design Brief.

**Convention:** Where the unqualified term "Design Brief" appears in these documents, it refers to the Proposal Design Brief unless context indicates otherwise (e.g., "Design Brief -- Structural" clearly refers to the structural section). This hierarchy is: Proposal Design Brief > discipline-specific Design Briefs.

> This note aligns with the corresponding Terminology Note in Datasheet.md and normalizes usage across all four documents. Source: DB document conventions; lensing item F-003.

### Comment Resolution Process Terminology (lensing item E-002)

Procedure.md uses several formulations for Owner review comment handling:
- Step B-2: "document comments; prepare response"
- Step B-3: "document and action comments"
- Verification V-09: "review comments addressed or formally deferred"

**Convention:** The intended process is consistent across milestones: (1) receive and log Owner comments, (2) prepare formal written responses, (3) incorporate accepted changes into the design, (4) formally defer any comments not incorporated (with rationale). The varying language reflects different emphasis at each milestone but describes the same process. The DB should standardize terminology in operational templates to prevent inconsistency.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CON-01-01-001 | RFP §4.2 limits proposal PDF to 15 MB, but a full multi-disciplinary design brief with drawings may exceed this limit. No exception or split-file guidance found in reviewed pages. Under Absolute Prescriptive Accounting (lensing item E-001), compliance with both requirements simultaneously may be impossible without clarification. | RFP §4.2 (PDF under 15 MB) | RFP §7.1.1 (detailed design brief including drawings) | Specification REQ-01-01-001; Procedure Step A-5 | Confirm with Owner/RFP Authority whether the 15 MB limit applies to the entire submission or individual files; check Addenda for clarification. **Priority: resolve before proposal assembly (Procedure Step A-5).** | TBD |
