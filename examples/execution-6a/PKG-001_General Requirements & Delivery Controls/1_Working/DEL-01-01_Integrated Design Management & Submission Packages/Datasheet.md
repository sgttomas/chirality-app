### Terminology Note — Design Brief Hierarchy

> **Vocabulary clarification (lensing item F-003):** "Proposal Design Brief" refers to the umbrella document submitted with the RFP response. It contains discipline-specific sections referred to as "Design Brief -- Architectural," "Design Brief -- Civil," etc. Where this document or related documents use the unqualified term "Design Brief," it refers to the Proposal Design Brief unless otherwise specified. This hierarchy applies across all four DEL-01-01 documents.

### Anticipated Artifacts

| Design Brief — Civil | Proposed civil design: building, parking, street access, services, drainage per OSR | RFP §7.1.2.2 |
| Design Brief — Structural | Proposed structural solution (considering cost, flexibility, expansion) | RFP §7.1.2.3 |
| Design Brief — Mechanical | Proposed main mechanical systems | RFP §7.1.2.4 |
| Design Brief — Electrical/IT | Power distribution, lighting, controls, communications, access control (if proposed) | RFP §7.1.2.5 |

| Design Coordination Matrix | Cross-discipline coordination tracker | _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact) |
| QA/QC Design Review Checklists | Checklists confirming conformance at each milestone | _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact); RFP §7.2 (Quality Mgmt reference) |

### Design Submission Milestone Sequence

| Milestone | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Proposal Design Brief | Submitted with RFP response (pre-award) | RFP §7.1.1–§7.1.2 |
| Building Design Development (DD) | Post-award; first formal milestone | RFP §7.1.8 |

| 100% IFC Full Package | Complete Issued for Construction package | RFP §7.1.8 |

## Conditions

| Condition | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Contract Type | Design-Build (CCDC 14-2013) | RFP §5.4; Appendix J |
| Contract Award Target | September 10, 2024 (per RFP schedule) | RFP §2.6 |
| Proposal Submission Deadline | August 30, 2024, 14:00:00 MST | RFP §5.3 |
| Design Professionals | Must be Alberta-registered (professional seals required) | RFP §7.1.2 |
| Owner Review Involvement | Owner/Project Committee reviews each design milestone submission | RFP §7.1.8 |
| Quality Management | DB responsible for all AHJ code compliance; QA approach required in proposal | RFP §7.2 |
| Project is NOT schedule-driven | DB encouraged to leverage schedule flexibility to reduce cost or increase value | RFP §2.2; SOW-0602 |
| Coordination Format | Design coordination matrix format: TBD (not prescribed by RFP) | ASSUMPTION |
| QA/QC Checklist Format | Format not prescribed by RFP; DB to propose | ASSUMPTION |
| CSA Standards Applicability | **TBD:** Specific CSA standards applicable to this project have not been enumerated. RFP §1 (Definitions) references CSA but specific standards are unconfirmed — see lensing item B-001. | RFP §1 (Definitions); location TBD |
| Addendum 03 Scope Changes | **Material Scope Changes (lensing item B-003):** Addendum 03 introduces significant changes affecting design management: (1) cold storage size confirmed at 60' × 100' clear-span (DEC-001); (2) bay sumps added to apparatus bays; (3) gear lockers specified; (4) generator backup power included. These changes have downstream implications for structural, mechanical, electrical, and site design. The Proposal Design Brief must explicitly acknowledge and incorporate all Addendum 03 changes to demonstrate design competence responsive to the evolved scope. Source: Addenda 01-03 (accessible); Decomposition (Addendum 03 references); Guidance Consideration 6. | Addenda 01–03 |

## Construction

> **Note:** "Construction" in this context refers to how the deliverable artifact (the design management system and submission packages) is assembled, not physical construction.

| Design Brief Disciplines | Minimum 5 discipline narratives (Architectural, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT) | RFP §7.1.2 |
| Conceptual Drawings | Dimensioned to indicate building size; 3-D renderings optional | RFP §7.1.1 |
| Milestone Submission Content | Elements, products, specifics of building assemblies and components | RFP §7.1.8 |
| Design Coordination Matrix | Must cover all disciplines identified in SOW-0003 | ASSUMPTION (based on _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact and RFP §7.1.2) |
| QA/QC Checklists | Must align with AHJ requirements and DB's quality management approach | ASSUMPTION (based on RFP §7.2) |
| Alberta Professional Seals | All design documents sealed by Alberta-registered professionals as required | RFP §7.1.2 |
