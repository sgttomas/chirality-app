# Specification: DEL-01-01 Integrated Design Management & Submission Packages

## Scope

### What This Deliverable Covers

DEL-01-01 covers all Design-Builder obligations related to **design management and formal design submission packages** for the Town of Penhold Public Services Building (PSB) project. Specifically this deliverable encompasses:

1. The **Proposal Design Brief** — a multi-disciplinary narrative (Architectural, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/IT) submitted with the RFP response that describes the Design-Builder's proposed approach to all major building components and systems.
2. **Design milestone submission packages** — formal submissions at defined review milestones (DD, 60%, Foundation IFC if needed, 100% DD, 100% IFC) following contract award.
3. A **design coordination matrix** — a cross-discipline tracking tool to manage interfaces during design.
4. **QA/QC design review checklists** — checklists confirming conformance at each design milestone.

### What This Deliverable Does Not Cover

- Physical construction activities (addressed in other PKG-001 deliverables and PKG-002–004).
- Project schedule development (DEL-01-02).
- Health and Safety planning (DEL-01-03).
- Permitting and inspections coordination (DEL-01-04).
- Meeting management and change control documentation (DEL-01-05).
- Site supervision and logistics (DEL-01-06).
- Commissioning, handover, and closeout (DEL-01-07).

| Milestone | Description |
|---|---|
| Building Design Development (DD) | Initial post-award milestone |
| 60% Detailed Design Review | Mid-design checkpoint |

| 100% Detailed Design | Near-complete design set |
| 100% IFC Full Package | Complete Issued for Construction package |

Each submission shall describe the elements, products, and specifics of building assemblies and components to show what is being provided.

- **Source:** RFP §7.1.8

### REQ-01-01-008: Multi-Disciplinary Design

All design shall be multi-disciplinary, covering architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, and IT/telecom disciplines. Specialty consultants shall be coordinated as required.

- **Source:** RFP §7.1.2; SOW-0003

### REQ-01-01-009: Alberta Professional Seals

All design documents that require professional seals under Alberta regulations shall be sealed by Alberta-registered professionals.

- **Source:** RFP §7.1.2

### REQ-01-01-010: Collaborative Design Process

The Design-Builder shall facilitate a collaborative design process with the Owner and stakeholders. The design process shall include timelines for:
- Owner review and approval;
- Municipal permitting process sequencing;
- Any special considerations.

- **Source:** RFP §7.1; SOW-0004

### REQ-01-01-011: Quality Management — Design

The Design-Builder shall ensure all work and project designs are prepared to meet all building codes and requirements of Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). A quality management approach shall be described in the Proposal.

- **Source:** RFP §7.2 (Quality Mgmt)
- **TBD (lensing item A-003):** Enumerate which specific AHJs apply to this project (e.g., municipal — Town of Penhold planning/development authority; provincial — Alberta Safety Codes; fire — local fire authority). The current statement "meet all building codes and requirements of AHJ" is necessary but not sufficient for compliance determination without AHJ identification. Source: RFP Authority / Owner to confirm.

### REQ-01-01-012: Design Coordination Matrix

The Design-Builder shall maintain a design coordination matrix to track cross-discipline interfaces and coordination requirements throughout the design phases.

- **Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact); RFP §7.1 (collaborative design process obligation) — **ASSUMPTION:** format and frequency of updates are not prescribed by RFP; DB to propose.
- **Note (lensing item F-002):** This requirement's source is `_CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact)` rather than a binding contract clause. The distinction between contractual obligation and DB-proposed best practice should be confirmed. If no binding source is identified, this requirement should be explicitly flagged as DB-proposed. Source: RFP Authority / contract review.

### REQ-01-01-013: QA/QC Design Review Checklists

The Design-Builder shall develop and apply QA/QC design review checklists at each design milestone to confirm conformance with RFP requirements, OSR, and applicable codes.

- **Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact); RFP §7.2 (Quality Mgmt) — **ASSUMPTION:** specific checklist format not prescribed by RFP; DB to propose consistent with quality management approach.
- **Note (lensing item F-002):** This requirement's source is `_CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact)` supplemented by the general RFP §7.2 quality management obligation. The QA/QC checklist is not explicitly mandated as a standalone artifact in the RFP. If no binding source is identified, this requirement should be explicitly flagged as DB-proposed. Source: RFP Authority / contract review.

### REQ-01-01-014: Supplementary Narratives — Accessibility, Durability, Adaptability

The Proposal Design Brief shall include supplementary narratives addressing:
- Accessibility (Alberta Building Code compliance per RFP §7.1.3);
- Building Durability / Ease of Repair and Maintenance (per RFP §7.1.4);
- Adaptability, Flexibility, and Potential for Expansion (per RFP §7.1.5).

- **Source:** RFP §7.1.3–§7.1.5; Procedure Step A-4 (which already includes these as required content).
- **Note (lensing items F-004, D-001):** These supplementary narratives were referenced in Procedure Step A-4 but had no corresponding Specification requirement. This requirement closes the gap. Verification approach: Confirm each supplementary narrative is present in the Proposal Design Brief and addresses the applicable RFP section content.

### REQ-01-01-015: Design Change Control Within Design Management

The Design-Builder shall implement a process for managing design changes that arise between formal milestones, including how design changes are proposed, evaluated for impact (schedule, budget, compliance), and approved before incorporation into milestone submission packages. This is distinct from contract-level change control (DEL-01-05).

- **Source:** RFP §7.1 (collaborative design process obligation); Procedure Step B-7 (references design change evaluation). **ASSUMPTION:** formal design change control is not explicitly mandated as a standalone requirement in the RFP but is implied by the collaborative design process and multi-milestone structure.
- **Note (lensing item X-002):** No document previously addressed how design changes between milestones are governed. Procedure Step B-7 mentions "design changes are evaluated for impact" but no formal requirement existed.

| REQ-01-01-009: Professional seals | Confirm Alberta-registered professionals' seals on all required documents. **TBD:** Develop acceptance criteria specifying which document types require seals at which milestones (DD vs. 60% vs. IFC) — not just at final IFC (lensing item A-002). Source: APEGA professional practice requirements; DB professional practice obligations. |

| REQ-01-01-014: Supplementary narratives | Confirm Accessibility, Durability/Maintenance, and Adaptability/Expansion narratives are present in the Proposal Design Brief and address RFP §7.1.3–§7.1.5 content respectively. Quality criteria for supplementary narrative content should include: (1) Accessibility — confirmation of ABC §3.8 compliance approach and any special features (accessible parking, entry, restrooms, signage); (2) Durability — identification of durable materials, maintenance-friendly finishes, and lifecycle cost considerations; (3) Adaptability — clear articulation of design flexibility for future expansion (structural grid, mechanical distribution routes, electrical panel capacity) per OSR §10.2 expansion potential. **TBD (lensing item D-001):** Human confirmation of quality threshold (minimal narrative vs. substantive design rationale). Source: RFP §7.1.3–§7.1.5. |
| REQ-01-01-015: Design change control | Confirm design change control process is documented, distributed to the design team, and applied at each milestone. Source: DB PM / contract terms. |
| Design management process performance | **TBD (lensing item A-005):** Add performance assessment criteria for measuring design management effectiveness (e.g., comment resolution turnaround time, coordination matrix currency, milestone submission timeliness). Currently, verification assesses deliverable completion but not process quality. Source: DB PM / Owner PM to define. |
