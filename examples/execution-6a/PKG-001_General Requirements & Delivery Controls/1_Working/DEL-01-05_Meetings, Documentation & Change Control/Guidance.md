# Guidance: DEL-01-05 — Meetings, Documentation & Change Control

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to ensure that the Design-Builder maintains a structured, auditable record of project communications, decisions, and change events throughout the full Design-Build delivery lifecycle. It is the primary mechanism through which the Project Committee stays informed, through which scope and cost changes are formally administered, and through which the Owner's Project Manager can exercise oversight.

The deliverable supports OBJ-008: "Execute a safe, controlled Design-Build delivery: H&S, quality, schedule/reporting, permitting/inspections, change management, and value optimization leveraging schedule flexibility." (ASSUMPTION: best-effort objective mapping per PACKAGE_HEURISTIC on PKG-001; source: Decomposition Phase 3 and Scope Ledger.) **TBD (Lensing D-003): Confirm whether OBJ-008 is the sole applicable objective or whether additional objectives apply.**

## Principles

### P-01: Consistency Over Completeness in Individual Items
A standard agenda, used consistently at every meeting, is more valuable than a highly detailed but variable agenda. Consistency allows the Project Committee to prepare efficiently, and enables the PM to detect deviations in project status more easily when the reporting structure does not change between meetings.

Source: RFP §7.3.5 ("develop a standard agenda to follow for all meetings").

### P-02: Timeliness Is a Contractual Requirement, Not a Courtesy
The 3-business-day agenda lead time and the 4-business-day minutes turnaround are RFP-specified obligations, not informal targets. Late agendas deprive the Project Committee of preparation time; late minutes allow action items and decisions to go un-confirmed.

Source: RFP §7.3.5.

### P-03: Integrated Schedule Communication
The project schedule is not a separate deliverable issued on an independent cycle — it is attached to every meeting agenda. This integration ensures that schedule status is always current at the time of each meeting and prevents the common failure mode of meeting discussions being uninformed by schedule data.

Source: RFP §7.3.5 ("issue with the agenda an updated project schedule").

### P-04: Single Source of Truth for Change Control
All change events (CCNs, change orders, site instructions, clarifications) must be logged in a single, continuously maintained change control log. Fragmented change tracking — across email threads, informal notes, or separate discipline logs — creates contract risk and makes it impossible to verify the scope of approved changes at claim or close-out.

Source: RFP §7.3 ("prepare, administer, and maintain on-site files of all … contemplated change notices, change orders, clarifications").

### P-05: Document Formatting Is an Agreed Standard
The Owner and Project Manager will establish the formatting, titling, and numbering standard at project outset. NMS format is the RFP-recommended basis. Adhering to this standard ensures all parties can navigate the document record consistently throughout the project and during close-out audits.

Source: RFP §7.2.

### P-06: Design-Builder Chairs Meetings by Contract Design (Lensing E-002)
In a Design-Build delivery model, the Design-Builder chairs progress meetings because the DB holds single-point responsibility for both design and construction. This allocation places the chairing obligation on the party with the most complete situational awareness of project status, risks, and interdisciplinary coordination. The Owner's PM retains oversight through minutes review, meeting attendance, and the authority to require changes to meeting minutes (RFP §7.3.5). This division ensures that meetings are led by the party executing the work while the Owner retains control through review and approval mechanisms. This structure supports OBJ-008 by enabling the DB to exercise direct oversight of design and construction coordination, H&S alignment, and schedule/budget reporting without intermediation.

Source: RFP §7.3.5 (DB chairs meetings); RFP §2.1 (Design-Build delivery model); Decomposition OBJ-008. ASSUMPTION (Lensing E-002): This rationale is standard Design-Build practice; no RFP text explicitly states the design-build value rationale for this allocation.

## Considerations

### C-01: Proposed Meeting Frequency
The RFP requires the DB to propose the meeting frequency. This is a design judgment that must balance: (a) the Owner's oversight needs, (b) the project phase (design-phase meetings may be less frequent than construction-phase meetings), and (c) the burden on the Project Committee. The DB should propose a specific frequency (e.g., bi-weekly during design, weekly during construction) and seek Project Committee confirmation at the outset.

Source: RFP §7.3.5 ("Design-Builder to propose meeting frequency and duration, based on project schedule").

### C-02: Tele/Videoconference vs. In-Person
Both formats are permissible. For regular progress meetings, in-person (Town of Penhold) is listed as the baseline; virtual attendance by subcontractors and sub-consultants is accommodated. The DB should establish a default format preference with the Project Committee early in the project and document it in the meeting terms of reference or the standard agenda header.

Source: RFP §7.3.5.

### C-03: Close-Out Meetings Are a Distinct Category
Close-out meetings are separate from regular progress meetings and should not be conflated with them. They are held specifically to complete all close-out activities and may involve different attendees (e.g., commissioning agents, Owner operations staff). The DB should anticipate scheduling these as a distinct meeting series near Substantial Performance.

Source: RFP §7.3.5.

### C-04: Monthly Reports vs. Meeting Minutes
Monthly progress reports and monthly control reports are standalone deliverables issued on a calendar basis. They are not a substitute for meeting minutes. Both must be produced; the monthly reports provide a formal period-end summary, while meeting minutes capture decisions and action items in near-real-time.

Source: RFP §7.3, §7.3.5.

### C-05: Shop Drawing Submittal Log Scope
The submittal log must capture not only shop drawings but also samples and other submittals from subcontractors. The DB's review obligation is to confirm compliance with the intent of approved working drawings and the OSR — not to re-engineer or redesign. Disposition codes (approved / approved as noted / revise and resubmit / rejected) should be consistent with the agreed formatting standard.

Source: RFP §7.3.

### C-06: Formatting Standard Must Be Confirmed Early
The document formatting, titling, and numbering standard must be established and agreed between the Owner and the Project Manager at project outset. The DB should initiate this discussion as part of project kick-off and obtain written confirmation before issuing the first batch of project documents.

Source: RFP §7.2.

### C-07: Escalation Path for Non-Response (Lensing B-003 / D-001)
Procedure Steps A-4 (meeting frequency confirmation) and B-4 (PM minutes review) assume that the Project Committee and PM will respond within a reasonable timeframe. However, no escalation path is defined if: (a) the Project Committee does not confirm proposed meeting frequency within an agreed window; or (b) the PM does not respond to minutes within the required review period (currently undefined). The DB should establish at project kick-off: (a) a default PM minutes review period (e.g., 5 business days), after which minutes are deemed accepted if no response is received; and (b) an escalation contact and procedure if the PM or Project Committee is unresponsive beyond the default period. **TBD (Lensing B-003 / D-001): Confirm with Owner/PM escalation contacts and default-acceptance timeframes. ASSUMPTION: Escalation provisions may be addressed in the CCDC 14-2013 supplementary conditions, but contract text was not accessed.**

Source: Procedure Steps A-4, B-4; RFP §7.3.5. Supplementary source: CCDC 14-2013 supplementary conditions (not accessed -- **location TBD**).

### C-07: Escalation Path for Non-Response (Lensing B-003)
Procedure Steps A-4 and B-4 assume that the Project Committee and PM will respond to meeting frequency proposals and minutes reviews, respectively, within a reasonable timeframe. However, no escalation path is defined if the PM does not respond to minutes within the required review window, or if the Project Committee does not confirm the proposed meeting frequency. The DB should establish at project kick-off: (a) a default response period for PM minutes review (e.g., 5 business days), after which minutes are deemed accepted; and (b) an escalation contact if the PM or Project Committee is unresponsive. **TBD: Define specific escalation contacts and default-acceptance periods.** ASSUMPTION: Escalation provisions may be addressed in the CCDC 14-2013 contract supplementary conditions, but the contract text is not accessed.

Source: Procedure Steps A-4, B-4; RFP §7.3.5. Supplementary source: CCDC 14-2013 (contract text not accessed -- **location TBD**).

### C-08: Terminology -- Monthly Progress Reports vs. Monthly Control Reports (Lensing A-002 / B-004)
This deliverable produces two distinct monthly reporting artifacts that must be maintained and tracked separately:

1. **Monthly progress reports** -- narrative summary of: (a) work completed in period; (b) upcoming work planned; (c) schedule status relative to baseline; (d) known risks and issues. Issuance: monthly on calendar basis. Source: RFP §7.3.5 ("monthly progress reports").

2. **Monthly control reports** -- quantitative report containing: (a) schedule percentage completion per task (including approved change orders); (b) budget status (where applicable); (c) key project metrics (quality, safety, etc.). Issuance: monthly on calendar basis. Source: RFP §7.2 ("Schedule Control monthly update"); RFP §7.3.

These are not interchangeable. Both must be produced monthly. Specification REQ-07 addresses both as separate requirements. Procedure Phase C, Steps C-1 and C-2, define distinct production processes for each. Datasheet Reporting table lists monthly progress report content and monthly control report content as separate rows. All four documents must maintain this distinction consistently throughout:
- **Specification**: REQ-07 covers both with clear distinction
- **Datasheet**: Reporting table has separate rows for monthly progress reports and monthly control reports
- **Procedure**: Phase C has separate steps (C-1, C-2) for each
- **Guidance**: This section (C-08) establishes consistent terminology

Where "monthly reports" is used as shorthand in meeting minutes or status discussions, clarify that this refers to both artifacts collectively. Maintain separate logs for tracking issuance and content of each artifact type.

### C-09: CCDC 14-2013 Change Control Integration (Lensing C-001)
The governing contract for this project is CCDC 14-2013 (with Town of Penhold supplementary conditions), per Datasheet Conditions table. CCDC 14-2013 contains its own provisions for change orders, contemplated changes, and contract administration. Procedure Phase D describes a CCN (Contemplated Change Notice)-based change control process derived from RFP §7.3, but does not explicitly trace how CCDC 14-2013 contract change mechanisms (e.g., CCDC change directive, change order, and contemplated change provisions) integrate with the RFP-described CCN process.

**TBD (Lensing C-001): At project kick-off, reconcile the RFP-based CCN/CO workflow (Procedure Phase D, Steps D-1 through D-4) with the CCDC 14-2013 contract change control provisions.** Key questions to resolve: (1) Are RFP CCNs equivalent to CCDC "change directives"? (2) Does the process comply with CCDC §6 (General Conditions governing changes)? (3) How are CCDC contemplated changes (6.2.1) vs. change orders (6.2.3) vs. directives (6.2.4) mapped to the RFP CCN process? (4) Must all CCNs be certified by the contract administrator or architect before issuance? ASSUMPTION: The RFP-based process is intended to implement the CCDC 14-2013 change control framework, but explicit reconciliation has not been performed because the CCDC 14-2013 contract text was not accessed during drafting.

Source: Datasheet Conditions table (CCDC 14-2013, RFP §5.4); Procedure Phase D; RFP §7.3. CCDC 14-2013 text -- **location TBD**. Recommend: consult a legal professional with CCDC experience to confirm alignment.

### C-10: Baseline Schedule Dependency (Lensing F-002)
This deliverable's meeting agenda obligation (REQ-04) requires that an updated project schedule be issued with each meeting agenda. This creates a dependency on DEL-01-02 (Baseline Schedule and Reporting): the schedule updates attached to agendas are updates against the baseline established by DEL-01-02. Procedure Prerequisites table notes this dependency. The DB must ensure that the baseline schedule from DEL-01-02 is established and approved by the Project Committee **before or coincident with** the first progress meeting (Procedure Step A-4/B-1 boundary). If the baseline schedule from DEL-01-02 is delayed or not yet finalized at the time the first meeting is scheduled, the DB should: (a) defer the first progress meeting until the baseline is available, or (b) with PM approval, issue a preliminary/draft schedule for the first meeting, noting that it is pending baseline finalization, with a commitment to issue updated schedule at the second meeting. **TBD (Lensing F-002): Confirm with Owner/PM the fallback approach if the DEL-01-02 baseline is not available at the target date for first meeting. Recommend: establish a schedule integration milestone during Procedure Phase A kick-off.**

## Trade-offs

### T-01: Meeting Frequency — Oversight vs. Efficiency
**Tension:** More frequent meetings provide better Owner oversight and faster issue resolution but consume PM and DB team time and may add overhead cost. Less frequent meetings reduce overhead but risk issues festering between reporting cycles.
**Resolution:** The RFP places the proposal burden on the DB. ASSUMPTION: A bi-weekly cadence during design phases and a weekly cadence during construction phases is consistent with industry norms for a project of this complexity. The DB should propose a frequency that scales with project phase.
**Rationale:** The project is not schedule-driven (per SOW-0602), which argues for a cadence optimized for quality and issue resolution rather than acceleration.
Source: RFP §7.3.5; SOW-0602.

### T-02: Digital vs. Hard Copy Document Files
**Tension:** The RFP references "on-site files" which implies physical hard copy; it also references digital format and formatting standards. The Owner's preference for hard copy vs. digital is not explicitly resolved in §7.3 for the ongoing site file (as distinct from close-out deliverables which require both hard copy and digital — see §7.5).
**Resolution (Lensing D-002):** The DB **shall** confirm the Owner's and PM's preferred format for ongoing site administration files at the project kick-off meeting (Procedure Step A-2). ASSUMPTION: As a procedural recommendation, the DB should add this as an explicit agenda item for the kick-off setup phase and document the agreed format in writing before establishing the document management system. The close-out requirement for both hard copy and digital (RFP §7.5) provides a reference point: if both formats are required at close-out, the DB should consider maintaining both throughout to avoid a conversion effort at project end.
**Rationale:** Most modern construction projects maintain a primary digital document management system (DMS) with hard copy backups for key documents. Obtaining explicit agreement at outset avoids ambiguity at close-out.
Source: RFP §7.3; §7.5 (close-out format provides a reference point).

### T-03: Standard Agenda Template — Fixed vs. Living Document
**Tension:** A completely fixed agenda template provides consistency but may become stale as the project moves from design to construction phases. A living template risks inconsistency if updated ad hoc.
**Resolution:** ASSUMPTION: The DB should maintain a phased agenda structure — a design-phase template and a construction-phase template — both reviewed and approved by the PM at the outset of each phase. Changes within a phase require PM acknowledgment.
Source: RFP §7.3.5 ("develop a standard agenda to follow for all meetings").

## Examples

### Example: Meeting Agenda Structure (ASSUMPTION — illustrative only)
A typical progress meeting agenda consistent with RFP §7.3.5 obligations might include:
1. Attendance and quorum
2. Review and adoption of previous minutes
3. Updated project schedule (attachment — required per §7.3.5)
4. Progress report: design/construction status by discipline
5. Schedule milestones: status, slippage, and recovery plans
6. Challenges and issues (DB-raised; PM/Owner response)
7. Proposed solutions for Project Committee review
8. Change control status (CCN/CO log excerpt)
9. Action items: carry-forward and new
10. Next meeting: date, format, agenda items

Note: This example is illustrative. The actual template must be developed by the DB and agreed with the PM at project outset.
