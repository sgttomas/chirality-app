# Procedure: DEL-01-05 — Meetings, Documentation & Change Control

## Purpose

This procedure describes:
1. **Production process** — how to establish and operate the meetings, documentation, and change control system for the Penhold PSB Design-Build project.
2. **Operational use** — how the meeting and documentation system is maintained and updated throughout the project lifecycle.

The procedure covers both the proposal-phase setup (what must be prepared before project kick-off) and the ongoing operational cadence (how the system runs after contract award).

## Steps

### Phase A — Project Kick-Off Setup (once, at contract award)

**Step A-1: Establish Document Formatting Standard**
- Initiate discussion with Owner and PM to establish the formatting, titling, and numbering standard for all project documents.
- Recommended basis: National Master Specification (NMS) format (per RFP §7.2). **(Lensing C-002): If NMS is not accessible or the team prefers an alternative, confirm agreement on substitute standard (e.g., AIA format, house standard, discipline-specific practice).**
- **Obtain written confirmation of agreed standard (signed letter, memo, or email from Owner/PM) before issuing any project documents.** (Lensing A-003: this written confirmation is evidence of standard establishment.)
- Output: Agreed document formatting standard (letter / memo on file). This confirmation is verification evidence for Specification REQ-12.

**Step A-2: Establish the Document Management System**
- Set up the on-site file structure to hold all required document categories:
  - RFIs
  - Site instructions
  - Contemplated change notices (CCNs)
  - Change orders
  - Clarifications
  - Field reports
  - Monthly progress reports
  - Monthly control reports
  - Health & Safety Plan (reference copy)
  - Shop drawings / submittals
  - Other applicable documents
- Confirm with PM whether primary system is digital (document management system) or hard copy, or both.
- Source: RFP §7.3.

**Step A-3: Develop Standard Meeting Agenda Template**
- Develop a standard agenda template for Design/Construction progress meetings. ASSUMPTION: Develop separate templates for design phase and construction phase.
- Minimum agenda elements (per RFP §7.3.5 obligations):
  - Attendance and adoption of previous minutes
  - Updated project schedule attachment (required)
  - Progress report: status vs. milestones
  - Challenges, issues, and proposed solutions
  - Change control status summary
  - Action items
- **Submit template to PM for formal review and written approval before first meeting.** Output: Approved standard agenda template (design phase version) with PM approval memo/email on file. (Lensing X-003: verification must confirm PM approval of the template itself, not merely template existence.)

**Step A-4: Propose Meeting Frequency and Duration**
- Prepare a proposed meeting schedule (frequency and duration per phase) and submit to Project Committee for agreement.
- ASSUMPTION: Propose bi-weekly during design phase; weekly during construction phase; close-out meetings as needed.
- Obtain Project Committee confirmation of proposed frequency.
- Output: Agreed meeting schedule / calendar.

**Step A-5: Schedule First Progress Meeting**
- Issue first meeting invitation with proposed agenda at least 3 business days in advance.
- Confirm attendance of Project Committee members; confirm tele/videoconference details if applicable.

---

### Phase B — Regular Meeting Cycle (recurring throughout project)

**Step B-1: Prepare and Issue Meeting Agenda (T-minus 3 business days)**
- Update the standard agenda template for the upcoming meeting.
- Prepare the updated project schedule attachment:
  - Progress against each milestone
  - Any slippage with explanation
  - Schedule recovery plan where applicable
- Issue agenda package (agenda + updated schedule) to all attendees at least 3 business days before the meeting.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step B-2: Chair the Progress Meeting**
- Chair the meeting with Project Committee (in-person at Town of Penhold or tele/videoconference).
- Ensure the meeting covers: progress, schedule, milestones, challenges, issues, and proposed solutions.
- Ensure subcontractors and sub-consultants attend as required (tele/videoconference acceptable).
- Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step B-3: Issue Meeting Minutes (within 4 business days)**
- Prepare draft minutes capturing: attendance, decisions, action items, and all material discussions.
- Issue minutes to all attendees within 4 business days of the meeting.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step B-4: Process PM Changes to Minutes (with Enforcement Mechanism)**
- PM reviews draft minutes and may request any required changes.
- DB incorporates PM changes and issues revised minutes if required.
- File final minutes in document management system.
- **(Lensing D-001):** Establish and enforce a PM minutes review deadline. ASSUMPTION: Recommend a default period of 5 business days from minutes distribution. If PM does not respond with changes within this period, minutes are deemed accepted. Document the agreed PM review period in writing at Procedure Step A-2 (kick-off documentation). If PM does not respond by the deadline:
  - Send escalation notice to PM and project Owner contact (per Guidance C-07).
  - If no response within 2 additional business days, file minutes as accepted.
  - Maintain an escalation log tracking instances where PM did not respond within agreed period.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5; Guidance C-07; Specification verification for REQ-05.

### Phase C — Monthly Reporting (recurring, calendar basis)

**Step C-1: Prepare Monthly Progress Report**
- Compile monthly progress summary: work completed in period, upcoming work, schedule status, known risks.
- Issue to PM and Project Committee on monthly basis.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5.

**Step C-2: Prepare Monthly Control Report**
- Compile monthly control report: schedule % completion per task (including approved change orders), budget status (where applicable), key metrics.
- Issue to PM on monthly basis.
- Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control monthly update obligation); RFP §7.3.

---

### Phase D — Change Control (event-driven, ongoing)

**Step D-1: Receive or Initiate Change Event**
- Identify change event: site instruction, RFI with design impact, Owner-initiated scope change, or unforeseen site condition.

**Step D-2: Issue Contemplated Change Notice (CCN)**
- Prepare CCN documenting the proposed change, scope impact, and estimated cost and schedule impact.
- Assign CCN number per document numbering standard.
- Submit CCN to PM for Owner review and decision.

**Step D-3: Issue Change Order or Clarification**
- If CCN is approved: issue formal change order incorporating the approved scope, cost, and schedule adjustment.
- If CCN is a clarification only (no cost/schedule impact): issue clarification document.
- Update change control log with all CCN, change order, and clarification records.

**Step D-4: Update Project Schedule**
- Incorporate approved change orders into the project schedule.
- Reflect in the next meeting agenda's updated schedule attachment.
- Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control — "including approved Change Orders, if any").

---

### Phase E — Submittal and RFI Administration (ongoing)

**Step E-1: Receive Submittal or RFI**
- Log receipt of shop drawing, sample, or submittal in the submittal log; log RFI in the RFI log.
- Assign document number per numbering standard.

**Step E-2: Review Submittal and Apply Standard Disposition Code**
- Review shop drawing / sample / submittal for compliance with intent of approved working drawings, specifications, and OSR.
- Note: DB review is for conformance with design intent, not re-engineering.
- **Apply one of the following standard disposition codes consistently across all submittals (Lensing F-003; per Guidance C-05):**
  - **Approved** -- submittal conforms with design intent; proceed.
  - **Approved as Noted** -- submittal conforms with minor notations; proceed with noted modifications.
  - **Revise and Resubmit** -- submittal does not conform; revise per comments and resubmit for review.
  - **Rejected** -- submittal does not conform and is not acceptable; prepare new submittal.
- **All disposition codes shall be standardized and consistent across the project.** Confirm the standard submittal disposition codes with the Owner and PM at Step A-1 as part of the formatting standard agreement (or as a separate submittal administration agreement). This standardization supports the agreed document formatting standard (Specification REQ-12; Procedure Step A-1).
- Source: RFP §7.3; Guidance C-05; Specification REQ-11.

**Step E-3: Return Submittal with Disposition**
- Return reviewed submittal to subcontractor with disposition noted.
- Update submittal log with review date and disposition.

**Step E-4: Process RFI Response with Target Turnaround**
- Prepare RFI response with clarification or design guidance.
- Issue to requesting subcontractor; file response in RFI log.
- **(Lensing A-004):** Establish and track RFI response turnaround. ASSUMPTION: The RFP specifies explicit turnaround times for agendas (3 business days) and minutes (4 business days) but does not specify RFI response turnaround. Recommend: establish a target RFI response time (e.g., 5 business days for simple clarifications, 10 business days for design-intensive RFIs) and confirm with Owner/PM at Step A-2 kick-off. Track all RFI response dates in the RFI log against the agreed target. Report RFI response performance in monthly control reports (Procedure Step C-2) if delays are trending.
- If RFI reveals scope change: initiate CCN per Step D-2.
- Source: RFP §7.3.

### Phase F — Close-Out Meetings (near Substantial Performance)

**Step F-1: Schedule Close-Out Meetings**
- As the project approaches Substantial Performance, schedule close-out meetings with relevant parties (Owner, PM, commissioning agent, operations staff as required).
- Source: RFP §7.3.5 ("hold close-out meetings as required for the completion of all close-out activities").

**Step F-2: Chair and Minute Close-Out Meetings**
- Apply same agenda and minutes obligations as regular progress meetings (3-business-day agenda lead; 4-business-day minutes turnaround).

**Step F-3: Document Close-Out Decisions**
- Ensure all close-out decisions (deficiency acceptance, training completion, handover confirmation) are captured in minutes and filed.
- Coordinate with DEL-01-07 (Commissioning, Handover, and Closeout) for artifact completeness.
