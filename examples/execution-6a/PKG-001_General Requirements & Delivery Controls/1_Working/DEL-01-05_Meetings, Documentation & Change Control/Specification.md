# Specification: DEL-01-05 — Meetings, Documentation & Change Control

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable covers all Design-Builder obligations for:
1. **Project meetings** — chairing, minuting, and reporting at regular Design/Construction progress meetings with the Project Committee throughout the project lifecycle (contract award through close-out).
2. **Project documentation** — maintaining on-site files for all project administration documents (RFIs, site instructions, CCNs, change orders, clarifications, field reports, monthly reports).
3. **Change control** — administering and logging all change control instruments (contemplated change notices, change orders, site instructions).
4. **Monthly reporting** — providing recurring monthly progress and control reports.

Source: RFP §7.3.5 (meetings and reporting); RFP §7.3 (documentation); Decomposition SOW-0011, SOW-0012.

### Exclusions
- Commissioning, training, and close-out documentation (covered by DEL-01-07_Commissioning-Handover-and-Closeout).
- Schedule baseline development and schedule delivery mechanism (covered by DEL-01-02_Baseline-Schedule-and-Reporting; the schedule update accompanying each agenda is a schedule communication artifact, not a baseline re-issue).
- Health & Safety Plan document (covered by DEL-01-03_Health-and-Safety-Plan; the H&S plan is maintained in the site file but not produced here).
- Legal and topographical survey (covered by DEL-01-07).

## Requirements

### REQ-01: Meeting Cadence and Chairing
The Design-Builder **shall** chair regular Design/Construction progress meetings with the Project Committee after contract award and for the duration of the project.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5
- The Design-Builder **shall** propose the meeting frequency and duration, based on the project schedule.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5
- **Note (Lensing A-001):** The RFP requires the DB to "propose" the meeting frequency but does not establish a minimum floor. **TBD: Determine whether a minimum meeting frequency is required as a normative obligation, or whether the DB's proposed frequency is wholly discretionary subject only to Project Committee acceptance.** ASSUMPTION: Guidance T-01 proposes bi-weekly during design phases and weekly during construction phases as consistent with industry norms, but this is not normative absent explicit minimum in the RFP. Source: Specification REQ-01; Guidance T-01.

### REQ-02: Meeting Format
Meetings **shall** be in-person (at Town of Penhold site or offices) or by tele/videoconference.

The Design-Builder **shall** issue, with each meeting agenda, an updated project schedule that includes:
- (a) progress against each milestone,
- (b) any slippage with explanations,
- (c) plans for schedule recovery where applicable.
- Source: RFP §7.3.5

### REQ-05: Meeting Minutes

The Design-Builder **shall** also provide monthly control reports containing schedule percentage completion per task (including approved change orders), budget status (where applicable), and key project metrics.
- Source: RFP §7.2 (Schedule Control monthly update obligation); RFP §7.3.
- **Note (Lensing A-002 / B-004):** The distinction between "monthly progress reports" (summary of work, schedule status, risks) and "monthly control reports" (schedule %, budget, metrics) must be maintained consistently. Both are required as separate artifacts. REQ-09 already lists both as site file categories. See Procedure Phase C, Steps C-1 and C-2 for content details.

### REQ-08: Close-Out Meetings
The Design-Builder **shall** hold close-out meetings as required to complete all close-out activities.

- Monthly control reports
- Site-specific Health & Safety Plan (maintained in file; primary production by DEL-01-03)
- Any other applicable construction documents
- Source: RFP §7.3

### REQ-10: Access to Documents
The Design-Builder **shall** provide access to drawings, specifications, and other design documents to:
- (a) the Owner,
- (b) the Project Manager,
- (c) any other consultants retained directly by the Owner.
- Source: RFP §7.3

### REQ-11: Shop Drawing and Submittal Review
The Design-Builder **shall** review shop drawings, samples, and other submittals from subcontractors to ensure they comply with the intent of the approved working drawings, specifications, and the OSR.

All hard copy documents, letters, and reports **shall** be formatted, titled, and numbered to a standard established and agreed to by the Owner and the Project Manager.
- Recommended format: National Master Specification (NMS).
- Source: RFP §7.2

### REQ-13: Professional Sealing of Documents
All planning, design, and construction documents requiring professional design services **shall** be sealed by an Alberta-registered professional Architect or Engineer.
- Source: RFP §7.2
- Note: This requirement applies to documents passing through the documentation system; the sealing obligation is a design-discipline responsibility carried through the document control process.

### REQ-14: Field Report Content and Frequency (Lensing X-001)
The Design-Builder **shall** produce field reports documenting site observations for each site visit by DB consultant disciplines (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, landscape).
- **TBD: Define field report minimum content requirements and production standard.** ASSUMPTION: Typical content elements include: (a) observation date and disciplines present; (b) site conditions observed; (c) progress observations relative to drawings/schedule; (d) quality observations; (e) issues identified; (f) photos/sketches as appropriate. Production trigger: per site visit by each discipline, or per consolidated daily log by discipline lead.
- Source: RFP §7.3 (field reports listed as a site file category); Datasheet Construction table; Procedure Records table.
- Note: Field report content and format will be confirmed at project kick-off based on DB practice standards and Owner/PM preferences.

TBD: Define the register format (spreadsheet listing document types, disciplines, assigned sealer, sealing date) and establish update frequency (e.g., monthly during design/construction phases).** |
| REQ-14 (field reports) | Evidence: Field reports on file demonstrating production per site visit **(Lensing X-001: field report content and format TBD)**; field report log tracking visit date, discipline, and report number/date. |
