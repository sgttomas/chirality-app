# Deliverable: DEL-01-05 Meetings, Documentation & Change Control

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes and sustains the formal communication, documentation, and change administration regime through which the Design-Builder discharges its project-controls obligations to the Owner and Project Manager. It must carry the knowledge needed to ensure that meeting cadence, minute accuracy, document filing integrity, and change-event traceability are maintained from contract award through close-out, so that every decision, instruction, and scope adjustment is recorded in a single auditable system of record.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Matrix D — Objectives (3x4)

### Construction: Addition A + resolution-transformed F

D is 3x4 (rows: normative, operative, evaluative; columns: guiding, applying, judging, reviewing).

`L_D(i,j) = A(i,j) + ("resolution" * F(i,j))`

For each cell, we first compute `"resolution" * F(i,j)`, then form the collection `{A(i,j), resolution*F(i,j)}`, then interpret.

Note: F columns are {necessity, sufficiency, completeness, consistency} and D columns are {guiding, applying, judging, reviewing}. The mapping is: guiding/necessity, applying/sufficiency, judging/completeness, reviewing/consistency.
