# Procedure: DEL-01-04 Permitting, Inspections & AHJ Coordination

## Purpose

This procedure describes how the Design-Builder produces and maintains the permitting, inspection, and AHJ coordination deliverables for the Penhold PSB project, and how the permit/inspection regime is operated throughout the project lifecycle (design through occupancy and Substantial Performance).

The procedure covers two phases:
- **Phase A (Production):** Developing the permit matrix and inspection/testing plan as documents.
- **Phase B (Operation):** Executing the permit and inspection program throughout design and construction.

## Steps

### Phase A — Permit Matrix and Inspection/Testing Plan Production

**Step A1: Identify All Required Permits**
Review the project design scope (all disciplines: architectural, structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, IT/telecom) and compile a comprehensive list of permit types required.

At minimum, consider the following permit categories for an Alberta municipal building project (ASSUMPTION: confirm with Town of Penhold AHJ):
- Development Permit
- Building Permit (architectural, structural)
- Electrical Permit
- Plumbing/Gas Permit
- Mechanical/HVAC Permit
- Occupancy Permit
- Environmental approvals (AEP — if required for flood/water constraints)
- Utility service connection approvals

Source: RFP §7.2, p.19; Decomposition Vocabulary Map (AHJ, AEP).

**Step A2: Build the Permit Matrix**
Populate the permit matrix with the following columns for each permit:
- Permit Type
- Issuing Authority (AHJ)
- Applicable Design Milestone (e.g., must be submitted at 60% DD, 100% IFC)
- Target Submission Date
- Actual Submission Date
- Permit Number (once issued)
- Approval Date
- Conditions / Notes
- Status (Not Started / Submitted / Approved / Conditional / Rejected)

Update the permit matrix throughout the project as statuses change.

Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; ASSUMPTION — standard permit matrix structure; not explicitly described in RFP.

**Step A3: Develop the Inspection/Testing Plan**
Working from the permit matrix and construction schedule (DEL-01-02), develop the inspection/testing plan:
- List all AHJ-required inspections by permit type and phase.
- List all Design-Builder consultant discipline inspections required per RFP §7.3.
- Identify hold-points (mandatory: work cannot proceed past uninspected stage).
- Assign responsible discipline for each inspection.
- Align inspection timing with construction milestones in the Gantt schedule.
- Define the reporting output for each inspection (written report, letter, AHJ sign-off).

Source: RFP §7.3, p.20; _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; ASSUMPTION — inspection hold-point structure is standard practice.

**Step A4: Review and Submit to Owner / Project Manager**
Submit the permit matrix and inspection/testing plan to the Owner / Project Manager for awareness (not approval, unless otherwise directed by the contract). Incorporate feedback.

Source: ASSUMPTION — consistent with RFP §7.3 documentation and reporting obligations; no explicit review cycle stated for these documents.

### Phase B — Operational Execution

**Step B0: Pre-Application AHJ Engagement (Recommended)**
Before submitting formal permit applications, engage the relevant AHJs (Town of Penhold permitting office, Alberta Safety Codes Officer) in pre-application meetings to discuss the project scope, identify potential permit objections, and confirm submission requirements. Document the outcome of each pre-application engagement (date, attendees, AHJ feedback, action items).

**Verification:** Confirm pre-application engagement has occurred (or document the decision to skip it with rationale) before proceeding to Step B1. If pre-application engagement is performed, file meeting notes as part of the AHJ correspondence record.

Source: Guidance.md (Early AHJ Engagement); **ASSUMPTION: pre-application engagement is not mandated by RFP but is recommended practice. This step is advisory unless the Owner directs otherwise.** (Ref: Lensing item X-002)

**Step B1: Submit Permit Applications**
Prepare and submit all permit applications to the relevant AHJs in accordance with the permit matrix timeline. Ensure all documents are sealed by Alberta-registered professionals where required. Retain copies of all submitted permit applications in the project file (see Records).

Source: RFP §7.2, p.19; RFP §7.2 (Quality Management), p.20.

**Step B2: Pay Permit Fees**
The Design-Builder pays all permit fees. Track actual costs against the project budget. No Owner reimbursement mechanism is stated in the RFP for permit fees.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19.

**Step B3: Coordinate AHJ Inspections**
Schedule and coordinate all AHJ inspections in accordance with the inspection/testing plan. Ensure relevant trades and consultant disciplines are present as required. Provide AHJ inspectors with access to the site and to construction documents.

Source: RFP §7.2, p.19; §7.3, p.20.

**Step B4: Conduct Consultant Discipline Inspections**
Ensure each consultant discipline (Architect, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, etc.) conducts site inspections per the inspection/testing plan. The Architect inspects at minimum monthly. All disciplines inspect at critical milestones.

Each inspection shall produce a written report of findings submitted with the corresponding progress draw.

Source: RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration), p.20.

**Step B5: Manage Re-Inspections and Directed Re-Work**
For any inspection that fails or results in AHJ directives:
1. Document the finding in the re-inspection response log.
2. Identify corrective action required and responsible party.
3. Execute corrective work.
4. Schedule and pay for re-inspection.
5. Record outcome in the permit matrix and re-inspection response log.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19; _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts.

**Step B6: Coordinate Utility Connections**
Engage Utility Provider(s) to coordinate all service and utility connections to the building. Obtain any required approvals or permits from Utility Providers. Track utility coordination status in the permit matrix.

Note: Utility service tie-in costs are a cash allowance (SOW-0110); track costs separately.

Source: RFP §7.3.3, p.21; Decomposition SOW-0009, SOW-0110.

**Step B7: Obtain Occupancy Permit**
Prior to Substantial Performance, obtain the occupancy permit from the AHJ. Confirm all outstanding permit conditions are cleared. Submit occupancy permit as part of the Substantial Performance package.

Source: Decomposition SOW-0015; RFP §7.5 (location TBD).

**Step B8: Issue Substantial Performance Conformance Letters**
At Substantial Performance, coordinate each consultant discipline to perform a final site visit and issue a letter certifying that construction is in general conformance with the Construction Documents.

Source: RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration), p.20.

|---|---|---|
| Pre-application AHJ engagement completed (or waiver documented) | Prior to first permit submission (Step B0) | Pre-application meeting notes or documented waiver with rationale. (Ref: Lensing item X-002) |
