# Guidance: DEL-01-04 Permitting, Inspections & AHJ Coordination

## Vocabulary Note

For consistency across all four documents in this deliverable bundle, the following terminology conventions apply:

| Term | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **AHJ** | Authority Having Jurisdiction. Expand on first use in each document as "Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)"; thereafter use "AHJ" consistently. | Do not use "regulatory bodies" or "code authority" as synonyms in normative or procedural contexts; reserve those for informal discussion only. |
| **AHJ Contact List** | A defined artifact (compiled by the DB) listing contact details for all applicable AHJs. | Referenced in Procedure Prerequisites and Datasheet Conditions. |
| **AEP** | Alberta Environment and Parks. A specific regulatory body that may function as an AHJ for flood/water-related constraints. | Use "AEP" only when referring to the specific provincial agency; do not conflate with the general "AHJ" term. |

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to ensure the Design-Builder systematically identifies, obtains, and manages all regulatory approvals and inspections needed to lawfully construct and occupy the Penhold Public Services Building. It supports OBJ-008 (safe, controlled Design-Build delivery) and OBJ-005 (site/civil works enabling operations, including utilities — ASSUMPTION: best-effort package heuristic mapping per OBJECTIVE_ASSOCIATION_MODE = PACKAGE_HEURISTIC).

The permit and inspection regime is not optional — it is a prerequisite for occupancy and Substantial Performance. Without it, the Owner cannot legally occupy the facility, and the Design-Builder cannot close out the contract. This deliverable is therefore on the critical path to project completion.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Design-Builder Bears Full Permitting Responsibility
The RFP places the entire burden of permitting — identification, submission, payment, and re-inspection — on the Design-Builder. There is no Owner-side permitting team. The Design-Builder should treat the permit matrix as a live project control tool, not a one-time submission.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19.

### Principle 2: AHJ Conformity is Non-Negotiable
All designs and work must comply with all AHJ requirements. The RFP explicitly states conformity is the Design-Builder's responsibility. AHJ engagement should begin early — at design development stage — to avoid late-stage non-conformity findings that trigger costly re-work.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Construction Methodology), p.19.

### Principle 3: Inspection is a Continuous, Scheduled Activity
Inspections are not just AHJ-triggered events. The RFP requires the Design-Builder's own consultant team to perform regular discipline site inspections throughout construction, with written reports per progress draw. The Architect inspects at minimum monthly. This is an ongoing operational obligation, not a closeout task.

Source: RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration), p.20.

### Principle 4: Utility Coordination is Part of Permitting Scope
The Design-Builder is responsible for coordinating all utility connections with Utility Providers. While utility tie-in costs are handled as a cash allowance (SOW-0110), the coordination and execution responsibility remains with the Design-Builder. Utility permits and service activation approvals should be tracked in the permit matrix.

Source: RFP §7.3.3, p.21; Decomposition SOW-0009, SOW-0110.

### Principle 5: Substantial Performance Requires All Permits Closed
The occupancy permit is a named deliverable for Substantial Performance. No Substantial Performance milestone can be achieved without all required permits obtained and all AHJ conditions satisfied.

## Considerations

### Permit Type Coverage
For a project of this nature in Alberta, the permit matrix should anticipate — at minimum — the following permit types (ASSUMPTION: inferred from project scope; confirm with local AHJ early in design):
- Development Permit (Town of Penhold)
- Building Permit (Town of Penhold or delegated AHJ)
- Electrical Permit (Safety Codes Officer)
- Plumbing/Gas Permit (Safety Codes Officer)
- Mechanical / HVAC Permit (Safety Codes Officer)
- Occupancy Permit (AHJ)
- Environmental approvals (AEP) -- **CRITICAL TBD (Ref: Lensing item C-001):** Confirm whether AEP environmental approval is a regulatory imperative for this site or merely a contingency. The project site includes a storm retention pond and areas in the flood fringe (Decomposition SOW-0102; Addendum 03 §1.1). The trigger condition for when AEP approval is required must be determined during early design, specifically: whether any proposed construction or grading activities fall within AEP-regulated areas (floodway, flood fringe, or water body setbacks). **Proposed resolution:** During design development Phase B, the Architect/Civil Engineer shall confirm with AEP whether project activities trigger AEP jurisdiction. (a) If AEP approval is required, it must be tracked as a separate permit in the permit matrix with a target submission date aligned with design milestones. (b) If not required, document the basis for exclusion in writing (e.g., "Site grading does not enter flood fringe; AEP approval not required per [reference to consultation]"). Store this determination in the project file.

The exact permit list must be confirmed with the Town of Penhold and relevant Alberta Safety Codes Councils early in the design phase.

### Early AHJ Engagement
Engaging the AHJ during design development (not at permit submission) reduces the risk of permit objections or conditions that require design rework. Pre-application meetings with the Town and Safety Codes Officer are advisable.

ASSUMPTION: Early AHJ engagement is not explicitly mandated by the RFP but is consistent with good practice for municipal Design-Build projects.

### Inspection Sequencing
The inspection/testing plan must align with the construction schedule. Key inspection hold-points (e.g., foundation pre-pour, framing, rough-in) must be flagged as milestone-linked events in the Gantt schedule (DEL-01-02) to prevent construction from proceeding past uninspected work.

ASSUMPTION: Inspection hold-point sequencing is not explicitly described in the RFP at this level of detail; derived from standard construction inspection practice.

### Boundary with DEL-01-03 (H&S Plan) Inspections

This deliverable (DEL-01-04) addresses AHJ compliance inspections and consultant discipline inspections related to code conformity, permit conditions, and construction quality. DEL-01-03 (Health & Safety Plan) addresses construction site safety inspections under the Alberta Occupational Health & Safety Act, including workplace hazard assessments and safety compliance audits.

The boundary between these two deliverables should be understood as follows:
- **DEL-01-04 scope:** Building code inspections (AHJ), permit-triggered inspections, consultant discipline inspections per RFP §7.3, and occupancy/Substantial Performance certification inspections.
- **DEL-01-03 scope:** OHS workplace safety inspections, hazard assessments, incident investigations, and safety compliance audits.
- **Overlap zone:** Some construction-phase inspections (e.g., structural integrity of scaffolding, fire protection system rough-in) may involve both safety and code compliance dimensions. The DB should ensure that inspection findings from either regime are cross-referenced where they affect the other (e.g., an AHJ structural finding that also has safety implications should be communicated to the H&S program).

**Rationale for separation (Ref: Lensing item C-002):** The separation of these deliverables reflects the split between regulatory compliance (AHJ/building code) and occupational health & safety obligations. However, the integrated process coverage lens reveals that coordination between the two regimes must be deliberate. **TBD: Confirm the coordination mechanism between DEL-01-04 and DEL-01-03 inspection regimes to avoid gaps or duplication.** Proposed approach: (a) Weekly coordination meetings between DB PM (DEL-01-04 lead) and H&S Manager (DEL-01-03 lead) to review inspection findings that cross regime boundaries; (b) cross-reference mechanism in inspection report logs to link related findings. Confirm this coordination approach with the Owner/Project Manager.

### Re-Inspection Management
Re-inspections carry both cost and schedule risk. The Design-Builder should track re-inspection frequency and root causes to identify systemic quality issues. Persistent re-inspection failures are a signal that QA/QC processes (RFP §7.2 Quality Management) are not functioning.

**Root cause analysis and escalation rationale (Ref: Lensing item D-002):** When re-inspections occur, the DB should categorize root causes and document the analysis in the re-inspection response log (e.g., workmanship deficiency, design error, miscommunication with AHJ, incomplete scope at inspection). **Escalation framework:** Define the threshold at which repeated re-inspection failures in a single scope area constitute a systemic quality failure warranting escalation. **Proposed framework (TBD for human confirmation):**
- **Threshold:** More than two re-inspections for the same deficiency type within a single discipline, OR any re-inspection failure that recurs after documented corrective action.
- **Evidence standard:** Root cause must be documented in writing with supporting evidence (inspection reports, corrective action records, quality control audit findings).
- **Escalation path:** First escalation to DB Project Manager + Site Quality Manager for coordinated remediation; if unresolved after 2 re-inspections following initial escalation, escalate to Owner/Project Committee + DB Principal in Charge.
- **Rationale:** This framework balances the need for accountability with recognition that some rework is normal in construction. The focus should be on preventing systemic failures rather than penalizing isolated deficiencies.

Confirm escalation thresholds and path with the Owner during the Preconstruction Meeting.

## Trade-offs

### Permit Cost Allocation
**Tension:** The RFP assigns permit costs entirely to the Design-Builder, but the actual permit fee schedule is established by the AHJ and is not within the DB's control.
**Resolution:** The Design-Builder must include permit fee estimates in the base price. If permit fees are substantially higher than anticipated, this is a DB risk unless otherwise addressed via contract supplementary conditions.
**Rationale:** The RFP is explicit that the DB oversees, manages, and pays for all permit costs (RFP §7.2, p.19). No mechanism for Owner sharing is stated.

Source: RFP §7.2, p.19.

### Inspection Reporting Frequency
**Tension:** Monthly Architect inspections are the minimum stated. More frequent inspections provide better oversight but increase consultant cost.
**Resolution:** The minimum (monthly for Architect; per-schedule for other disciplines) should be treated as a floor, not a ceiling. Higher-risk construction phases (e.g., structural, fire protection) should trigger additional discipline-specific reviews.
**Rationale:** The RFP states "at minimum" — leaving upward discretion to the Design-Builder. Source: RFP §7.3, p.20.

### Utility Tie-In Coordination vs. Cost
**Tension:** Utility tie-in costs are a cash allowance (Owner direction), but coordination and execution remain DB responsibilities. The boundary between "coordination" and "billable cost" must be clearly tracked.
**Resolution:** The DB should document all coordination activities for utility connections separately from construction costs to support accurate reporting against the cash allowance.
**Rationale:** Decomposition SOW-0110 notes the DB is still responsible for design coordination and execution once conditions are confirmed.

---

### Independent Compliance Validation

**TBD Question (Ref: Lensing item E-001):** Does the Owner require any independent third-party compliance validation beyond AHJ approvals (e.g., independent code review, peer review of permit submissions)? The RFP does not explicitly address this. Currently, the verification approach for code conformity (REQ-01-04-04) relies on AHJ permit approvals and consultant discipline certifications.

**Why this matters:** If the Owner expects additional third-party validation (e.g., a code consultant peer review of permit submittals), this should be explicitly captured as a requirement and budgeted as a cost. If AHJ approval alone is deemed sufficient evidence of conformity, document this as an Owner decision.

**Proposed resolution:** Confirm with the Owner during pre-construction whether independent code review or peer review of permit submissions is required. If required, add it as a step in Procedure Phase B and allocate cost. If not required, document the Owner's acceptance of AHJ approval as sufficient evidence.

### Document Quality Standards (NMS Applicability)

The Specification Standards table lists the National Master Specification (NMS) as a "Recommended format for construction documents and documentation" (ASSUMPTION, per RFP §7.2 Quality Management, p.20).

**TBD Question (Ref: Lensing item E-002):** Does NMS format apply to permit-related documents (permit applications, inspection reports, re-inspection responses) or only to construction design documents?

**Why this matters:** Permit documents are regulatory artifacts that must meet both AHJ and Owner standards. Clarifying whether NMS governs the format and content of permit applications and inspection reports ensures consistency and compliance.

**Proposed resolution:** Confirm with the Owner whether: (a) NMS applies to all permit-related documentation in this deliverable (and if so, identify the applicable NMS sections); or (b) permit documents follow AHJ/standard formats only, with a separate Owner quality standard. Document the determination and communicate it to the DB consultant team.
