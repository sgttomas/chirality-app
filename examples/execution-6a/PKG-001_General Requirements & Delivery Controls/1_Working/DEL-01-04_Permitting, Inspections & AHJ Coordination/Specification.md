## Requirements

### REQ-01-04-01: Permit Responsibility
The Design-Builder shall oversee, manage, and pay for all costs associated with all required permits and inspections applicable to the project location.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19.
**Notes:** Includes building permits, development permits, and any specialty permits (fire, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, etc.) as identified in the permit matrix. **TBD: Permit fee reporting mechanism** — Clarify whether permit fee estimates must be itemized by permit type in the DB's proposal or may be carried as a lump-sum allowance. The RFP assigns all permit costs to the DB (RFP §7.2) but does not prescribe how these costs are reported or accounted for. **Proposed resolution:** The DB should account for and report permit fee expenditures in the progress draws and final reconciliation; the accounting method (itemized vs. lump sum) should be confirmed with the Owner during pre-construction. (Ref: Lensing item A-002)

---

### REQ-01-04-02: Re-Work and Re-Inspection Costs
The Design-Builder shall pay for all directed re-work and all subsequent re-inspection costs arising from inspection failures or AHJ directives.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19.

---

### REQ-01-04-03: Utility Connection Coordination
The Design-Builder shall complete and coordinate all required services and utility connections to the building with Utility Provider(s).

**Source:** RFP §7.3.3 (New Site Services and Utilities), p.21; RFP §7.2, p.19.
**Notes:** Utility service tie-in costs are treated as a cash allowance (SOW-0110). Design-Builder remains responsible for design coordination and execution once conditions are confirmed.

---

### REQ-01-04-04: Code Conformity
All work and project designs shall meet all building codes and requirements of all Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJs). Conformity is the Design-Builder's full responsibility.

**Source:** RFP §7.2 (Construction Methodology), p.19.
**Notes:** Governing code is the Alberta Building Code (external reference; clause-level requirements TBD -- not accessible).
**Verification note:** The verification approach for this requirement relies on AHJ permit approvals as evidence of conformity. However, some construction work may not be subject to AHJ inspection (e.g., work between inspection hold-points, or scopes not covered by a specific permit). TBD: Define acceptance criteria for demonstrating code conformity for work items not directly inspected by an AHJ -- for example, through consultant discipline inspection reports (REQ-01-04-07) or self-certification by the DB's registered professionals. (Ref: Lensing item A-003)

---

### REQ-01-04-05: Permit Matrix
The Design-Builder shall produce and maintain a permit matrix identifying all permits required, the issuing authority, anticipated submission timing, and permit status.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION -- derived from the anticipated artifacts listed in _CONTEXT.md and Decomposition PKG-001 table; standard industry practice for Design-Build permitting management. No explicit RFP clause directly mandates the matrix format.
**Completeness threshold:** The permit matrix shall be considered "complete" when: (a) all known permit types are populated with no blank required fields, (b) each permit row includes a status value from the defined status set (Not Started / Submitted / Approved / Conditional / Rejected), and (c) the matrix is updated within 5 business days of any permit status change. **Binding compliance threshold (Ref: Lensing item F-001):** The permit matrix must satisfy these criteria before acceptance at any monthly milestone review. TBD: Confirm these specific thresholds (5 business day update window, status value set) with the Owner/Project Manager.

---

### REQ-01-04-06: Inspection/Testing Plan
The Design-Builder shall develop an inspection/testing plan identifying required inspections by discipline, responsible party, frequency, and construction milestone alignment.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from anticipated artifacts in _CONTEXT.md; supported by RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration) requirement for each discipline to perform regular site inspections and provide written reports.

---

### REQ-01-04-07: Consultant Discipline Inspections
Each discipline of the Design-Builder's consultant team shall perform regular site inspections and provide written reports of findings with each progress draw. The Architect shall inspect at minimum monthly. Other disciplines shall inspect per the approved project schedule and at all critical milestones.

**Source:** RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration), p.20.
**Minimum report content and format (Ref: Lensing item F-003):** Each discipline inspection report shall include, at minimum: (a) date of inspection, (b) inspector name and discipline, (c) scope of work inspected, (d) findings and observations, (e) recommendations or required corrective actions, and (f) sign-off by the responsible registered professional. **TBD: Confirm whether a standard report template will be mandated or if each discipline may use its own format.** Reports must satisfy this minimum content requirement before acceptance. (**ASSUMPTION: minimum content elements are proposed based on standard industry practice; not explicitly prescribed in RFP**)

---

### REQ-01-04-08: Substantial Performance Certification
At Substantial Performance, each discipline of the Design-Builder's consultant team shall perform a site visit and issue a letter certifying that the construction is in general conformance with the Construction Documents.

**Source:** RFP §7.3 (Construction Phase and Administration), p.20.

---

### REQ-01-04-09: Re-Inspection Responses
The Design-Builder shall prepare and maintain written re-inspection responses documenting corrective actions taken in response to failed or flagged inspections.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — derived from anticipated artifacts in _CONTEXT.md; consistent with RFP §7.2 requirement to manage and pay for directed re-work and re-inspections.

---

### REQ-01-04-10: Occupancy Permit
The Design-Builder shall obtain an occupancy permit as part of Substantial Performance deliverables.

**Source:** RFP §7.5 (Substantial Performance of the Work) -- **SourceRef location TBD** (section not read in this session); referenced in Decomposition SOW-0015.
**Source verification note (Ref: Lensing item B-003):** The precise RFP §7.5 content has not been read in this session. **Critical TBD:** Confirm the exact RFP §7.5 text to fully scope occupancy permit requirements and update this SourceRef from "location TBD" to a precise section reference. This affects Specification scope, Datasheet Conditions, and Procedure closure criteria.

---

### REQ-01-04-11: Permit Processing Performance Targets
The Design-Builder should establish and track performance targets for permit processing, including target turnaround times for permit submissions and a maximum acceptable re-inspection count per scope area before escalation.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION -- no explicit RFP clause mandates permit processing KPIs. Derived from standard project controls practice and the need for measurable performance assessment of the permitting process. (Ref: Lensing item A-004)

---

### REQ-01-04-12: Permit Lifecycle Closure Criteria
The permit lifecycle for this deliverable shall be considered complete when: (a) all permits in the permit matrix have reached a terminal "Approved" status with no outstanding conditions, (b) all AHJ conditions have been satisfied and documented, and (c) the occupancy permit has been obtained per REQ-01-04-10.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION -- derived from the aggregate of REQ-01-04-05 (permit matrix) and REQ-01-04-10 (occupancy permit); no single RFP clause states an explicit aggregate closure criterion, but Substantial Performance requirements (RFP §7.5, Decomposition SOW-0015) imply all permits must be resolved. (Ref: Lensing item D-001)
