## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Permit responsibility** | Design-Builder oversees, manages, and pays for all required permits and inspections | RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19 |
| **Directed re-work** | Design-Builder pays for all directed re-work and subsequent re-inspection costs | RFP §7.2 (Permits, Inspections and Approvals), p.19 |
| **Utility connections** | Design-Builder responsible for connection of building services and utilities to Utility Providers | RFP §7.2 p.19; RFP §7.3.3, p.21 |
| **Code conformity** | All work and designs must meet building codes and requirements of all AHJs; conformity is Design-Builder's responsibility | RFP §7.2 (Construction Methodology), p.19 |
| **Consultant site inspections** | Each discipline must perform regular site inspections and provide written reports with each progress draw; Architect minimum monthly | RFP §7.3, p.20 |
| **Substantial performance certification** | At substantial performance, each discipline certifies construction is in general conformance with Construction Documents | RFP §7.3, p.20 |
| **Governing code** | Alberta Building Code — clause-level prescriptions applicable to permitting and inspections TBD (code text not accessible) | _REFERENCES.md; text not accessible — clause-level requirements TBD |
| **Permit fee responsibility** | Included in Design-Builder's scope (no separate Owner allowance stated for permits; utility tie-ins treated as cash allowance per SOW-0110) | RFP §7.2; Decomposition SOW-0009/SOW-0110 |
| **Anticipated permit fee schedule** | TBD — permit fee schedule or fee range data for each permit type. Must be obtained from Town of Penhold and applicable Alberta Safety Codes Councils. Comprehensive fee data (even as TBD placeholders) should be captured to support DB pricing and cost tracking. | **Ref: Lensing item B-002** — Town of Penhold fee schedule (not accessible) |
| **Permit fee reporting mechanism** | TBD — Clarify whether permit fee estimates must be itemized in the base price or may be carried as a lump sum allowance within the DB's proposal. The RFP assigns all permit costs to DB, but no mechanism describes how the DB accounts for or reports permit fee expenditures. | **Ref: Lensing item A-002** |
