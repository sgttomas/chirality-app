## Steps

### Part A — Producing the H&S Deliverable Suite

**Step A1 — Assign H&S Lead**
Designate a qualified H&S professional or officer within the Design-Builder organization who holds responsibility for developing, maintaining, and enforcing the H&S Plan. Document this assignment.

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard Prime Contractor obligation under Alberta OHS Act; location TBD)

**Step A2 — Review Regulatory Requirements**
Review the Alberta OHS Act, Regulations, and Code for Prime Contractor obligations. Confirm the applicable clauses and their requirements for the project-specific H&S Plan.

Source: Alberta OHS Act and Regulations (_REFERENCES.md — external)

**Step A3 — Conduct Preliminary Hazard Identification**
Review available site information (geotechnical report, site grading, site location, project scope) to identify preliminary site-specific hazards relevant to the PSB project. Document findings.

Source: RFP §7.2 — "specific site challenges"; Appendix D (Geotechnical), Appendix E (Site Grading) available in _Sources/

**Step A4 — Draft Proposal H&S Narrative**
Prepare the H&S narrative for inclusion in the Proposal. The narrative must:
- Confirm the Design-Builder's Prime Contractor designation under the Alberta OHS Act
- Describe site access management measures
- Describe the training plan approach
- Identify muster point strategy
- Describe emergency response approach
- Identify and address specific site challenges identified in Step A3

Source: RFP §7.2 (Health and Safety), page 19; RFP §7.2 (Construction Methodology preamble), page 19

**Step A5 — Develop Full Project-Specific H&S Plan (Post-Award)**
Expand the Proposal narrative into the full project-specific H&S Plan. Address all five required content areas in detail:
1. Construction site access (access control procedures, visitor management, authorized personnel)
2. Training plans (site orientation content, delivery schedule, records)
3. Muster points (locations identified, communicated to all workers)
4. Emergency procedures (emergency contacts, escalation, notification to AHJ)
5. Specific site challenges (hazards identified in Step A3, with controls)

Source: RFP §7.2, page 19

**Step A6 — Develop Site Orientation and Training Plan**
Prepare a stand-alone orientation and training plan document. Include:
- Orientation content and delivery method
- Topics covered (site rules, H&S Plan summary, emergency procedures, muster points)
- Attendance tracking and records process
- Required refresher/re-orientation triggers (new workers, significant condition changes)

Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); REQ-07

**Step A7 -- Prepare Hazard Assessments**
Conduct formal hazard assessments for site work activities and site conditions. Include:
- Hazard identification for each significant work activity
- Risk rating (severity x likelihood -- ASSUMPTION: standard hazard assessment format; see Guidance C2 for methodology rationale)
- Control measures (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, PPE)
- Responsible party for each control

**Step A7a -- Specify PPE Requirements**
As the final tier of the control hierarchy, define minimum Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements for the project:
- Minimum site PPE standards (e.g., hard hat, safety boots, high-visibility vest, safety glasses -- TBD based on site hazard assessment)
- Task-specific PPE requirements (e.g., fall protection for work at height, respiratory protection for dust/fumes -- TBD based on hazard assessments)
- PPE inspection and replacement schedule
- PPE enforcement mechanism (aligned with REQ-06 and REQ-11)

Source: ASSUMPTION -- standard H&S practice; PPE requirements are a standard component of Alberta OHS Code (location TBD) [Lensing: F-002]

Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); Alberta OHS Act (location TBD); REQ-08

**Step A8 — Prepare Emergency Response Plan**
Develop the emergency response plan. Include at minimum:
- Emergency scenarios anticipated on site
- Muster point locations (map)
- Emergency contacts (internal H&S Lead, local emergency services, Alberta OHS emergency)
- Notification and reporting obligations to AHJ
- Worker assembly and accounting procedures
- First aid resources and locations

Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); RFP §7.2 (emergencies and muster points); REQ-09

**Step A9 — Internal Review and Approval**
Review all four documents for completeness, internal consistency, and regulatory compliance. Obtain sign-off from Design-Builder leadership and H&S Lead.

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard Quality Management practice; RFP §7.2 Quality Management)

**Step A10 — Establish On-Site File**
Place signed copies of all four documents in the on-site files prior to first worker mobilization on site.

Source: RFP §7.3, page 20

### Part B — Maintaining and Operating the H&S Plan Suite

**Step B1 — Site Orientation for All Workers**
Conduct site orientation per the Orientation and Training Plan (Step A6) for every worker and subcontractor before they begin work on site. Maintain attendance records.

Source: REQ-07; RFP §7.2

**Step B2 — Communicate Muster Points**
Communicate muster point locations to all workers at site orientation and post muster point signage visibly on site.

Source: RFP §7.2 (muster points), page 19; REQ-09

**Step B3 — Enforce Site Access Controls**
Implement and enforce the site access management procedures defined in the H&S Plan. Verify all personnel on site have completed orientation before access.

Source: RFP §7.2 (construction site access), page 19; REQ-02

**Step B4 — Enforce Strict H&S Policy**
Site Superintendent to maintain and enforce the H&S policy daily. Conduct regular site H&S inspections and document findings.

Source: RFP §7.3, page 21; REQ-06

**Step B4a -- Prepare for Regulatory Audits and AHJ Inspections**
Maintain ongoing readiness for Alberta OHS regulatory audits and AHJ inspections:
- Establish a pre-audit checklist confirming all H&S documentation is current, accessible, and on-site
- Define inspection coordination protocol: who is the point of contact for AHJ inspectors, how inspectors are received on site, what records are presented
- Define response protocol for audit findings: timeline for corrective actions, follow-up confirmation, documentation of closure
- Frequency: pre-audit readiness review at minimum monthly (TBD -- frequency to be confirmed based on project phase and regulatory expectations)

Source: ASSUMPTION -- standard Prime Contractor obligation under Alberta OHS Act (location TBD); REQ-10 [Lensing: A-004]

**Step B5 -- Update H&S Documents as Conditions Change**
Review and update H&S Plan, hazard assessments, and emergency response plan when:
- New subcontractors mobilize
- New work phases commence
- Site conditions change materially (defined as: introduction of a new hazard type not previously assessed, transition to a new construction phase, subcontractor mobilization exceeding TBD threshold, or any condition requiring revision of existing hazard controls -- [Lensing: X-003])
- An H&S incident occurs

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard Prime Contractor obligation; living document principle); RFP §7.3

**Step B6 — Incident Reporting**
Report all incidents and near-misses per Alberta OHS Act requirements. Maintain incident log on site. Notify AHJ as required.

Source: Alberta OHS Act (location TBD); ASSUMPTION: required under Prime Contractor obligations

**Step B7 -- Periodic H&S Plan Quality Review**
Conduct a scheduled periodic review of the H&S Plan suite for quality, effectiveness, and continued relevance, independent of event-triggered updates (Step B5):
- Frequency: TBD (e.g., quarterly or at major phase transitions)
- Review scope: all four sub-plans assessed for currency, completeness, and effectiveness
- Include lessons-learned integration from incidents, near-misses, and inspection findings
- Document review findings and required updates; obtain H&S Lead sign-off on review conclusions
- Report review outcomes to Design-Builder project leadership

Source: ASSUMPTION -- standard H&S management practice; complements event-triggered updates in Step B5 [Lensing: D-002]

**Step B8 -- Document Retention through Substantial Performance**
Retain all H&S records, orientation attendance logs, incident logs, and hazard assessment updates through Substantial Performance and for the period required by Alberta OHS Act (location TBD).
