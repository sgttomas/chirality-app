# Guidance: DEL-01-03 Health & Safety (Prime Contractor) Plan

## Purpose

This deliverable exists because the Design-Builder is designated as the "Prime Contractor" under the Alberta Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) Act for the Town of Penhold PSB project. As Prime Contractor, the Design-Builder bears full legal responsibility for worker and site safety during the construction phase. The RFP explicitly requires a project-specific H&S Plan that addresses site access, training, muster points, emergencies, and site-specific challenges as a condition of the proposal and the contract.

This deliverable supports OBJ-008: Execute a safe, controlled Design-Build delivery.

Beyond regulatory compliance, the H&S Plan serves a broader purpose: fostering a proactive safety culture that prioritizes worker well-being and positions safety as an integral part of project quality and success, not merely a legal obligation. A robust H&S program contributes to workforce morale, productivity, and community confidence in the project. [Lensing: F-003]

## Principles

### P1 — Prime Contractor Accountability
The Design-Builder, as Prime Contractor, bears legal accountability for all H&S responsibilities under the Alberta OHS Act. The H&S Plan must reflect this — it is not a template document but a project-specific commitment to safety governance.

Source: RFP §7.2, page 19

### P2 — Site-Specificity
The H&S Plan must address the specific characteristics of the Penhold PSB project site, including unique site challenges (e.g., proximity to occupied municipal operations, construction adjacent to active areas — ASSUMPTION pending site-specific hazard assessment). Generic content that does not address project conditions is insufficient.

Source: RFP §7.2 (Health and Safety) — "specific site challenges" requirement, page 19

### P3 — Comprehensive Coverage of Sub-Plans
The four anticipated artifacts (H&S Plan, orientation/training plan, hazard assessments, emergency response plan) work together as an integrated suite. Deficiency in any one sub-plan weakens the overall H&S regime. Each artifact addresses a distinct operational need: the H&S Plan sets the framework; training ensures workers understand expectations; hazard assessments identify specific risks; the emergency response plan prepares for incidents.

Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); RFP §7.2

### P4 — Living Document
The H&S Plan is a living document. It must be maintained on-site and updated as project conditions change (new hazards identified, subcontractor mobilization, site conditions evolving). The plan should be treated as an active management tool, not a one-time submission.

Source: RFP §7.3, page 20

### P5 — Worker and Visitor Access Control
Site access controls are explicitly required. The plan must describe how access is managed, who is authorized, what orientation must be completed before site access, and how access is enforced.

## Considerations

### C1 -- Alberta OHS Act Compliance Complexity
The Alberta OHS Act and its associated Regulations and OHS Code impose detailed requirements on Prime Contractors. The text of the Act, Regulations, and Code is not directly reproduced here (external reference; not accessed). The Design-Builder must ensure legal counsel and/or a qualified H&S professional reviews the plan for compliance. Specific clause requirements are TBD pending review of the Act. In particular, the specific clauses/Parts defining Prime Contractor duties and the specific OHS Code technical provisions (e.g., fall protection, confined space, excavation) applicable to this project must be identified and documented. Until this review is complete, the regulatory imperative cannot be fully assessed. [Lensing: A-001, C-001, E-001]

### C2 -- Site-Specific Hazards
Hazards specific to the PSB project site may include, but are not limited to:
- Proximity to Waskasoo Avenue and public circulation (ASSUMPTION based on site location description in Decomposition SOW-0101)
- Existing municipal operations on or adjacent to site (ASSUMPTION)
- Cold climate construction conditions in central Alberta (ASSUMPTION)
- Geotechnical conditions (information available in Appendix D -- Geotechnical Investigation; accessible in _Sources/)

These should be addressed in hazard assessments.

**Hazard assessment methodology rationale:** The severity x likelihood matrix format (referenced in Procedure Step A7) is adopted as a standard risk assessment approach widely used in construction H&S management. This format provides a structured, repeatable framework for prioritizing hazards and allocating controls. However, confirmation that this format satisfies specific Alberta OHS Act requirements is TBD -- the Design-Builder's qualified H&S professional should verify suitability upon review of the Act and Code text. [Lensing: C-003]

### C3 — Subcontractor Obligations
The Prime Contractor designation flows to subcontractors working on site. The H&S Plan should address how subcontractor H&S compliance will be managed, monitored, and documented. This is an ASSUMPTION based on standard Prime Contractor obligations under the Alberta OHS Act (location TBD in Act).

### C4 -- Integration with Site Supervision
The Site Superintendent (DEL-01-06 -- Site Supervision and Logistics) is the day-to-day enforcer of the H&S Plan on site. The H&S Plan should clearly assign enforcement responsibilities and escalation paths. Alignment between this deliverable and DEL-01-06 is recommended.

**Governance escalation path:** The H&S Plan should define a clear escalation framework for H&S governance failures: (1) H&S Lead has authority to issue stop-work orders for imminent danger situations; (2) unresolved H&S issues escalate from H&S Lead to Site Superintendent to Design-Builder project leadership; (3) regulatory non-compliance or serious incidents escalate to Owner notification and AHJ reporting as required by Alberta OHS Act. The boundary of responsibility between this deliverable (H&S Plan) and DEL-01-06 (Site Supervision) should be formally defined: the H&S Plan establishes the framework and requirements; Site Supervision executes daily enforcement. TBD -- the formal interface agreement between DEL-01-03 and DEL-01-06 should be documented. [Lensing: X-001, E-002]

### C5 — Proposal vs. Construction Plan
The RFP requires a H&S narrative in the Proposal (pre-award). Post-award, the full project-specific plan is to be implemented. The Specification requirement REQ-04 addresses the proposal narrative; REQ-02 addresses the post-award operational plan. These are distinct but must be consistent.

## Trade-offs

| Tension | Resolution | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Generic vs. site-specific content | Prioritize site-specific content | RFP explicitly requires a project-specific approach; generic H&S plans do not satisfy the "specific site challenges" requirement (RFP §7.2) |
| Proposal narrative brevity vs. plan completeness | Proposal narrative is a summary; full plan developed post-award | The Proposal narrative must demonstrate credible intent; the operational plan provides the full detail. Both are required. |
| Prescriptive plan vs. adaptive plan | Adaptive (living document) preferred | Site conditions change during construction; a static plan cannot address evolving hazards (RFP §7.3 on-site maintenance obligation) |

## Examples

TBD — No specific examples are provided in the accessible sources. The RFP identifies five required content areas (site access, training plans, muster points, emergencies, specific site challenges) as structural guidance for the plan's content.

## Vocabulary Note

**Canonical term:** "H&S Plan" (abbreviation for "Health & Safety Plan"). All four documents should use "H&S Plan" as the standard short form when referring to this deliverable. The full form "Health & Safety Plan" should be used at first mention in each document, followed by "(H&S Plan)" to establish the abbreviation. Avoid variations such as "H&S plan" (lowercase), "Health and Safety Plan" (without ampersand), or "project-specific Health & Safety Plan" (use "project-specific H&S Plan" after first mention).
