# Procedure: DEL-01-07 Commissioning, Training, Closeout & Warranty

## Purpose

This procedure describes two complementary processes:

1. **Production Process (Proposal Phase):** Steps to produce the commissioning, training, closeout, and warranty narrative that forms part of the Design-Build proposal submission, satisfying REQ-01-07-001 (RFP §7.3.6).

2. **Execution Process (Construction and Closeout Phase):** Steps to execute and deliver the commissioning plan, training, as-built documentation, deficiency management, and warranty program, satisfying REQ-01-07-002 through REQ-01-07-016.

Both processes are described to demonstrate end-to-end understanding of the deliverable lifecycle, as expected for a 4-doc bundle for this type of closeout deliverable.

### Part B: Execution Phase — Commissioning, Training, Closeout, and Warranty Delivery

**Step B1: Establish O&M Submittal Requirements with Subcontractors**
At subcontract award, communicate O&M manual submittal requirements to all subcontractors. Specify:
- Required documentation (testing certificates, maintenance equipment docs, supplier contact information, start-up reports, manufacturer warranties)
- Format requirements
- Submission deadline (aligned with construction schedule, before substantial performance)
Source: RFP §7.5; Guidance C2.

**Step B1A: Track Subcontractor O&M Submittal Compliance (per D-002)**
Throughout the construction phase, maintain a tracking log or checklist monitoring each subcontractor's O&M submittal status against the requirements established in Step B1:
- Track which subcontractors have submitted required documentation (testing certificates, maintenance equipment docs, supplier contacts, start-up reports, manufacturer warranties)
- Flag overdue submittals and escalate before they become critical-path items at closeout
- Review submittal status at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or at construction milestone reviews)
- Report submittal status to project management team
Source: Guidance C2 (ASSUMPTION: O&M submittal tracking is standard practice to prevent Substantial Performance gate delays; no specific RFP clause mandates tracking frequency).

**Step B2: Maintain As-Built Field Markups During Construction**
Throughout the construction phase, maintain continuous field markup records for all disciplines. Assign responsibility to each discipline lead or subcontractor. Markups form the basis of the final as-built drawing production.
Source: Guidance C1 (ASSUMPTION: best practice).

**Step B3: Coordinate AHJ Inspections**
Coordinate building and fire code inspections and all regulatory approvals required for occupancy:
- Confirm AHJ inspection timeline and requirements

Source: RFP §7.5; Guidance C3.

**Step B3A: Verify Commissioning Readiness (per F-003, X-002)**
Prior to commencing commissioning execution (Step B4), conduct a formal readiness verification:
- Confirm construction is substantially complete for all systems to be commissioned
- Confirm all systems are installed, energized, and safe to commission
- Confirm commissioning plan has been approved by Owner (per REQ-01-07-001A)
- Document readiness determination with a go/no-go decision record
- If any system is not ready, document the exception and defer commissioning for that system until readiness is confirmed
Source: Procedure Execution Phase Prerequisites; REQ-01-07-002 (ASSUMPTION: standard commissioning practice requires explicit readiness verification; no specific RFP clause mandates this gate).

**Step B4: Execute Commissioning**
Conduct system-by-system commissioning:
