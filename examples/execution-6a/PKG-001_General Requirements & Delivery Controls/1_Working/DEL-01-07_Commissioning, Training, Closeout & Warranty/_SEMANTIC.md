# Deliverable: DEL-01-07 Commissioning, Training, Closeout & Warranty

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable governs the terminal transition from construction to operations, ensuring that built systems are verified through commissioning, operational knowledge is formally transferred to the Owner through training and documentation, permanent as-built records are established, deficiencies are tracked to resolution, and warranty obligations provide post-occupancy remedy. The semantic lens must address categories of handover readiness -- the types of proof, knowledge transfer, and accountability mechanisms that demonstrate a facility is genuinely fit for sustained independent operation.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**
