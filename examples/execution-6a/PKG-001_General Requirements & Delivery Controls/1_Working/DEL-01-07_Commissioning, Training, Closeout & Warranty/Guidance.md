# Guidance: DEL-01-07 Commissioning, Training, Closeout & Warranty

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to ensure the Town of Penhold receives a building that is not merely constructed but genuinely ready for operations. OBJ-009 — "Achieve operational handover readiness, including commissioning, training, closeout documentation, legal survey, and warranty support" — establishes the acceptance standard: Substantial Performance is only achieved when the Owner holds the Occupancy Permit, final commissioning documents, all O&M manuals, As-Built Drawings, and Legal Survey (RFP §7.5).

The deliverable is structured to protect the Owner's interests at the most vulnerable transition point in a Design-Build project: when physical construction is largely complete but the building has not yet been proven in operation. At this stage, information asymmetry is highest — the Design-Builder understands the systems; the Owner's staff does not yet. This deliverable transfers that knowledge formally.

## Principles

### P1: Commissioning as a System-Level Test, Not a Checklist
Commissioning is intended to verify that all systems operate as designed — not simply that individual components have been installed. The RFP requires the Design-Builder to coordinate with vendors, designers, and Building Operations staff to ensure all systems work together (RFP §7.5). The commissioning approach should be described in the proposal with sufficient specificity to give the Owner confidence that this systemic verification will occur.

### P2: Training Must Be Operationally Effective
Training is not fulfilled by handing over a manual. The Design-Builder must provide and fully document staff training to Owner's staff on all building systems (RFP §7.5). For a combined fire hall and public works facility, the building operations staff are primarily firefighters and public works personnel — not facilities engineers. Training materials and instruction must be calibrated to this audience. **ASSUMPTION:** Training will need to address 24/7 operations context and should be practically oriented rather than technically dense.

### P3: Documentation Must Survive the Design-Builder's Involvement
As-Built drawings and O&M manuals must be complete and usable independently by the Owner's staff and future contractors. The requirement for 2 hard copies plus a complete digital copy in Owner-approved format (RFP §7.5) reflects this: digital files can be shared with future designers; binders support on-site operations use. CAD files in DWG format ensure the Owner is not locked into the Design-Builder's software environment.

### P4: Deficiency Process Protects Both Parties
The deficiency process is explicitly structured to balance accountability:
- Trade punch lists submitted by the Design-Builder before formal review signals self-assessment.
- A formal Deficiency Meeting establishes agreed approach and dates (RFP §7.3.7).
- A single consolidated deficiency list (including both DB and Owner items) prevents parallel lists and disputes (RFP §7.3.7).
- The Owner's right to add deficiencies up to 6 weeks post-occupancy acknowledges that some issues only emerge in use (RFP §7.3.7).
- The 2.5x retention right (RFP §7.3.7) is a strong incentive to correct deficiencies promptly.

### P5: Warranty Is Contractual, Not Discretionary
The 12-month all-inclusive warranty from occupancy permit date is a firm contractual requirement (RFP §7.6). Manufacturer warranties are not a substitute — they must also be assigned to the Owner via the O&M manual (RFP §7.6). The Design-Builder's plan should demonstrate a clear process for tracking warranty issues and responding within the warranty period, not simply acknowledging the obligation.

### P6: Legal Survey Is a Permanent Record
The certified legal/topographical survey (RFP §7.4) is not an administrative formality. It creates the permanent record of what was actually built and where: building outlines, corners, service connections, finished floor elevations, and topographical contours. This information is required for future renovations, expansions, utility work, and regulatory compliance. The survey must be conducted by a licensed surveyor and must reflect actual as-built conditions, not design intent.

## Considerations

### C1: Timing of As-Built Drawing Compilation
As-built drawings are most accurate when maintained as a living document throughout construction and updated continuously — not assembled retrospectively at closeout. **ASSUMPTION:** Projects that attempt to reconstruct as-built conditions at the end of construction frequently produce lower-quality documentation. The Design-Builder should establish a field markup process during construction that feeds into the final as-built submission.

### C1A: As-Built Drawing Accuracy Standard (per F-004)
The RFP requires as-built drawings of "all physical building attributes" (RFP §7.5) but does not define a minimum accuracy standard for what constitutes an acceptable as-built versus a design-intent drawing. Guidance on accuracy should address: (a) what magnitude of deviation from design must be recorded (e.g., any field change, or only changes beyond a dimensional threshold -- TBD); (b) whether as-built drawings must reflect actual measured dimensions or design dimensions adjusted for known changes; (c) how to handle concealed conditions where as-built verification is impractical after installation (e.g., below-grade services, in-wall routing). **ASSUMPTION:** Industry practice generally requires that all field changes be recorded regardless of magnitude, but a project-specific accuracy standard would benefit both parties. This is a quality criterion gap; the Owner or contract documents should define expectations.

### C2: O&M Manual Completeness Dependency on Subcontractors and Suppliers
The O&M manuals require content from all subcontractors, manufacturers, and suppliers (testing certificates, warranty documents, contact lists, start-up reports). This content depends on the full subcontractor and supplier chain. **ASSUMPTION:** The Design-Builder should establish O&M submittal requirements with subcontractors at the time of award — not at closeout. Late submission of subcontractor content is a common source of delay at the Substantial Performance gate.

### C3: Occupancy Permit Dependencies
The Occupancy Permit is one of the five prerequisites for Substantial Performance (RFP §7.5). The Design-Builder must obtain building and fire code inspections and occupancy permits (RFP §7.5). For a combined fire hall and public works facility, fire code compliance is likely to be a more intensive inspection process than for a typical commercial building. **ASSUMPTION:** Early coordination with the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) is advisable to identify fire code inspection timelines and plan commissioning/closeout sequencing accordingly.

### C3A: Coordination with DEL-01-04 (Permitting, Inspections & AHJ Coordination) (per E-003)
REQ-01-07-007 requires the Design-Builder to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for occupancy, which overlaps with the scope of DEL-01-04 (Permitting, Inspections & AHJ Coordination). The AHJ inspection activities, fire code compliance process, and occupancy permit application tracked under DEL-01-04 directly feed into this deliverable's Substantial Performance gate. The Design-Builder should ensure explicit coordination between the DEL-01-04 and DEL-01-07 workflows to avoid duplication of effort or gaps in coverage:
- DEL-01-04 owns the pre-construction and ongoing permitting, inspection scheduling, and AHJ coordination process.
- DEL-01-07 owns the final occupancy permit acquisition and use of that permit as the Substantial Performance trigger.
- Close communication is required so that fire code inspections (which are typically the longest lead-time item) are scheduled to complete in time for the occupancy permit to be issued before other SP prerequisites are due.
- Coordination meetings should be documented in project meeting minutes, with clear assignment of AHJ coordination tasks and escalation protocols if inspections are delayed.

**ASSUMPTION:** DEL-01-04 handles the ongoing permitting and inspection process during construction; DEL-01-07 addresses the final occupancy permit as a closeout gate. The interface between these two deliverables should be formally documented. See also Datasheet Dependencies and Interfaces table.

### C4: Commissioning Plan as Proposal Evaluation Element
The RFP explicitly asks proponents to describe the commissioning approach as a proposal requirement (RFP §7.3.6). This is an evaluation criterion (RFP §8, scoring matrix — location TBD for specific weight). The proposal commissioning narrative should be specific and credible, not generic.

### C5: Scope of "All Building Systems" for Training
The phrase "all building systems" in RFP §7.5 encompasses the full range of systems in a combined firehall and public works building: HVAC, electrical distribution, emergency power/generator, apparatus bay direct exhaust, compressed air, bay overhead doors (including secondary/backup mechanisms), lighting controls, IT/telecom infrastructure, security/access control (if Owner-elected), and fire alarm. **ASSUMPTION:** The training program should be organized system-by-system, with Owner staff responsible for each system identified in advance to ensure appropriate coverage.

### C5A: IT/Telecom As-Built Drawing Scope and Complexity (per X-001)
The As-Built Drawing Package Contents example lists "IT/telecom as-built drawings (conduit routing, panel locations)" but the unique challenges of IT/telecom documentation are not addressed in the main considerations. IT/telecom as-built documentation may require coordination with a separate IT consultant or the Owner's IT department, particularly for:
- **Structured cabling plant documentation:** Cable schedules, patch panel assignments, floor plans with outlet locations, media type (cat6, multimode fiber, etc.), circuit identification.
- **Wireless access point locations:** Documented on floor plans with signal strength estimations if survey was performed.
- **Telecom room layouts:** Equipment identification, rack diagrams, cable management labeling, utility penetrations.
- **Coordination with Owner-provided IT infrastructure:** Design-Builder may have installed only the physical infrastructure (conduit, cable tray, backboxes), with Owner or third-party IT integrator providing active equipment and cabling.
- **Training implications:** If Owner will operate and maintain IT/telecom systems, training should address how to use as-built documentation to locate outlets, trace circuits, and access telecom room equipment. If Owner's IT department will handle all maintenance, training may be minimal.

**ASSUMPTION:** IT/telecom as-built scope should be clarified with the Owner in the commissioning plan to determine whether the Design-Builder's obligation extends only to physical infrastructure (conduit, cable tray, backboxes) or includes active equipment documentation. This distinction affects both the as-built drawing scope and the training program scope (Guidance C5). The Owner should confirm whether IT/telecom training is required and at what level of technical depth.

### C6: Deficiency Monetary Value Assignment
The requirement to assign monetary values to each deficient item (RFP §7.3.7) is not standard practice on all projects. This value is used in the Substantial Performance calculation. The Design-Builder should understand that the Owner's retention right (2.5x) is calculated against these monetary values — inaccurate or undervalued deficiency lists increase the Design-Builder's financial exposure if the Owner disputes the valuation.

## Trade-offs

### T1: Commissioning Thoroughness vs. Schedule Pressure
**Tension:** Commissioning and closeout documentation activities can be compressed under schedule pressure when practical completion is near.
**Resolution:** The RFP's explicit Substantial Performance gate (no SP without all five deliverables — RFP §7.5) means that rushed or incomplete commissioning and documentation directly delays final payment. Thoroughness is financially incentivized.
**Rationale:** Protect Owner interests and Design-Builder's final payment timeline equally by front-loading commissioning planning rather than treating it as a closeout afterthought.

### T2: Hard Copy vs. Digital Delivery
**Tension:** Digital delivery is lower cost and easier to update; hard copies are more durable for on-site use.
**Resolution:** RFP §7.5 requires both — 2 hard copies in 3-ring binders AND a complete digital copy. There is no trade-off to make; both are required.
**Rationale:** The dual format serves different operational contexts. Digital copy supports future design work (DWG files); binders support on-site maintenance staff who may not have consistent access to digital systems.

### T3: Single vs. Separate Deficiency Lists
**Tension:** It is administratively simpler for the Design-Builder to maintain its own internal punch list separately from the Owner's.
**Resolution:** RFP §7.3.7 explicitly requires a single deficiency list incorporating both parties' identified items. The Design-Builder must establish a process to incorporate Owner-identified items.
**Rationale:** A single list prevents disputes about which items have been acknowledged and tracked. It also clarifies the Substantial Performance calculation basis.

### T4: Breadth of Manufacturer Warranty Coverage
**Tension:** The Design-Builder may be tempted to limit the O&M warranty section to major system warranties (roof, HVAC, major equipment) rather than including all manufacturer warranties.
**Resolution:** RFP §7.6 specifically calls out examples of manufacturer warranties to be included: "roofing, flooring, appliances, equipment, etc." — the "etc." signals broad coverage is expected. All manufacturer warranties should be systematically collected and included.
**Rationale:** The Owner's long-term maintenance and warranty claims depend on complete warranty documentation. Gaps in coverage transfer risk to the Owner.

## Examples

The following examples are derived from RFP §7.5 requirements and represent the minimum expected content of specific artifacts.

### Example: As-Built Drawing Package Contents (from RFP §7.5)
The O&M binder structure for As-Built drawings should include, at minimum:
- Architectural as-built plans, sections, and details
- Structural as-built drawings
- Mechanical (HVAC, plumbing, exhaust) as-built drawings
- Electrical (power distribution, lighting, emergency power) as-built drawings
- Plumbing as-built drawings
- IT/telecom as-built drawings (conduit routing, panel locations)
- Civil/site as-built drawings (service connections, grading)
All submitted in DWG (CAD) and PDF.

### Example: Five-Document Substantial Performance Trigger (from RFP §7.5)
Substantial Performance cannot be claimed until ALL of the following are in the Owner's possession:
1. Occupancy Permit
2. Final commissioning documents
3. All operations and maintenance manuals
4. As-Built Drawings
5. A Legal Survey

Missing any one item means the Substantial Performance gate is not satisfied.

### Example: Deficiency Process Sequence (from RFP §7.3.7)
1. Design-Builder establishes trade punch lists and submits prior to formal deficiency review
2. Formal Deficiency Meeting held — approach and dates agreed
3. Complete inspection completed; comprehensive deficiency list prepared with monetary values
4. Owner consolidates own identified items into single deficiency list
5. Owner may retain up to 2.5x calculated deficiency cost
6. Owner may add further deficiencies up to 6 weeks post-occupancy
7. All deficiencies corrected to Owner and OSR satisfaction before total completion / final payment
