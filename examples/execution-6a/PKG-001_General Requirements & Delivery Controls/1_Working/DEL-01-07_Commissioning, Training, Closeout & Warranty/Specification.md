## Requirements

### REQ-01-07-001: Commissioning Narrative (Proposal Phase)
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall provide a narrative describing the commissioning approach in the proposal, including how handover and training will work, how training documentation and instruction manuals will be produced, and how As-Built drawings and O&M manuals will be completed in a quality and timely manner.
**Source:** RFP §7.3.6
**SOW:** SOW-0013

### REQ-01-07-001A: Commissioning Plan Approval (Pre-Execution Gate)
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall submit the detailed commissioning plan to the Owner for review and approval prior to commencing commissioning execution activities. Commissioning execution shall not proceed until Owner approval of the commissioning plan is obtained.
**Source:** **ASSUMPTION (F-002):** No explicit RFP clause requires pre-execution plan approval, but REQ-01-07-002 references "approved commissioning plan," implying an approval gate exists. This requirement is inferred as standard practice to close the conformance gap between proposal narrative (REQ-01-07-001) and execution (REQ-01-07-002). Confirm whether RFP or CCDC 14-2013 supplementary conditions establish this gate.
**SOW:** SOW-0013

### REQ-01-07-002: Commissioning Execution
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall execute commissioning, training, and closeout procedures in accordance with the approved commissioning plan, coordinating with vendors, Design-Builders, designers, and Building Operations staff. Commissioning execution shall not commence until all systems are confirmed installed, energized, and safe to commission.
**Source:** RFP §7.3.6, §7.5
**SOW:** SOW-0013, SOW-0015
**Note (X-002):** System energization and safety verification prerequisite added per lensing item X-002. Procedure execution prerequisites state "systems are installed and energized" but the normative requirement did not previously specify this precondition. **ASSUMPTION:** Standard commissioning practice requires confirmation of system readiness before commissioning activities begin.

### REQ-01-07-002B: Commissioning Agent/Coordinator Qualifications
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall identify the commissioning agent or Cx coordinator responsible for overseeing all commissioning activities. Qualifications and relevant experience of the commissioning agent/coordinator shall be submitted to the Owner for review. TBD: specific certification or qualification requirements (e.g., ASHRAE BCxP, ACG-certified).
**Source:** **ASSUMPTION (B-005):** No explicit RFP clause specifies Cx coordinator qualifications. However, Procedure Step A2 references the "commissioning agent/Cx coordinator role and responsibilities," and competent expertise for commissioning requires defined qualifications. This requirement is inferred as standard practice. Confirm whether Owner has qualification preferences.
**SOW:** SOW-0013

### REQ-01-07-003: Owner Staff Training
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall provide and fully document staff training to the Owner's staff on all building systems.
**Source:** RFP §7.5
**SOW:** SOW-0013

### REQ-01-07-004: As-Built Drawings
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall deliver as-built drawings of all physical building attributes, including architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing details. As-built drawings shall be submitted in DWG format (CAD) and PDF format. Delivery: two (2) hard copies in 3-ring binders with labelled tabs, plus a complete digital copy in Owner-approved format.
**Source:** RFP §7.5
**SOW:** SOW-0013, SOW-0015
**Note (C-002):** "Structural" added to the discipline list to align with Guidance Example (As-Built Drawing Package Contents) and Procedure Step B6, both of which include structural as a required discipline. RFP §7.5 states "all physical building attributes" which encompasses structural. **ASSUMPTION:** Structural as-builts are required based on "all physical building attributes" language and cross-document consistency.

### REQ-01-07-005: O&M Manuals
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall deliver Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manuals for all systems, including: all maintenance equipment and testing certificates for new systems, equipment, and materials; manufacturer and supplier contact list; warranties; and start-up reports. Product/manufacturer warranties and guarantee certificates (e.g., roofing, flooring, appliances, equipment) shall be included. Delivery: two (2) hard copies in 3-ring binders with labelled tabs, plus a complete digital copy in Owner-approved format.
**Source:** RFP §7.5
**SOW:** SOW-0013, SOW-0015
**Note (F-001):** "Owner-approved format" for digital deliverables in REQ-01-07-004 and REQ-01-07-005 is undefined in RFP §7.5. The Design-Builder shall confirm format requirements with the Owner prior to production. See also Guidance OI-01-07-003.

The survey shall be performed by a licensed Alberta Land Surveyor (ALS).
**Source:** RFP §7.4
**SOW:** SOW-0113
**Note (B-001):** Licensed surveyor requirement added to the normative requirement for consistency with Guidance P6 ("must be conducted by a licensed surveyor"). **ASSUMPTION:** Alberta Land Surveyor licensing is the applicable standard for certified legal surveys in Alberta; confirm against Land Titles Act requirements (location TBD).

### REQ-01-07-009: Trade Punch Lists and Deficiency Review
**Statement:** At an appropriate time during the project, the Design-Builder shall: (a) establish trade punch lists and submit prior to formal deficiency review; (b) hold a formal Deficiency Meeting to agree on the deficiency review approach and dates; (c) undertake a complete inspection and prepare a comprehensive deficiency list with monetary values assigned to each remaining/deficient item, for comparison with Substantial Performance calculation including approved change orders.

**Source:** RFP §7.3.6, §7.3.7
**SOW:** SOW-0014
**Note:** "OSR" appears in RFP §7.3.7 and decomposition SOW-0014 without expansion in the text reviewed. **ASSUMPTION:** OSR = Owner's Site Representative (a common abbreviation in construction management). Full definition should be confirmed against RFP §1 Definitions (location TBD — pages not reviewed).

### REQ-01-07-012: Owner Deficiency Retention Rights
**Statement:** The Owner may retain up to 2.5 times the value of the calculated deficiency cost until all deficiencies are corrected, unless otherwise agreed to by the Owner. The Owner may add deficiencies to the list up to six (6) weeks after occupancy. The Payment Certifier will retain sufficient funds from progress draws to cover completion of unfinished and deficient work.
**Source:** RFP §7.3.7
