## Completeness and Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Specification Structure:** All seven deliverables follow consistent 4-document structure (Specification, Procedure, Datasheet, Guidance)
2. **Detailed Requirements:** 87+ total normative requirements across all deliverables with clear sourcing (RFP clauses or ASSUMPTION-based inferences)
3. **Verification Approaches:** Each requirement includes explicit verification method and acceptance criteria
4. **Transparent Gap Identification:** Lensing items systematically document assumptions, TBD items, and gaps requiring Owner/PM confirmation
5. **Traceability:** Scope coverage mapped to decomposition SOW items (SOW-0001 through SOW-0113); requirements traced to RFP clauses or standards

### Areas Requiring Owner/PM Attention

1. **Assumption-Based Requirements:** Significant portions of requirements (e.g., H&S Act compliance details, design change control process, commissioning plan pre-approval gate) are inferred from standard practice rather than explicit RFP language. Recommend confirmation of these as normative obligations.

2. **Undefined Performance Standards:**
   - Schedule performance KPIs (schedule variance thresholds, float consumption limits) — DEL-01-02
   - H&S performance metrics (incident rate targets, inspection frequency) — DEL-01-03
   - Site cleanliness objective acceptance criteria — DEL-01-06
   - Commissioning plan and report format definitions — DEL-01-07

3. **AHJ and Code References:** Multiple deliverables reference "Alberta Building Code," "all building codes and AHJ requirements," and "Alberta OHS Act" without enumerating specific provisions. Recommend:
   - Identification of applicable AHJs (municipal — Town of Penhold planning/development; provincial — Alberta Safety Codes; fire — local fire authority)
   - Confirmation of specific ABC edition and applicability hierarchy with NBCC
   - Enumeration of specific applicable CSA standards

4. **Contract Document Gaps:** Several requirements reference "TBD upon CCDC 14-2013 Appendix J review" (e.g., supplementary conditions, delay claim provisions, Substantial Performance definition). Recommend early review and explicit confirmation.

5. **Digital Format Specifications:** Commissioning reports, training materials, and digital deliverable formats are deferred to Owner confirmation (DEL-01-07 A-005, F-001). Recommend early standardization.

### Documentation Maturity

**Current State:** SEMANTIC_READY across all deliverables (Chirality Framework state)
- All artifacts present and internally consistent
- Semantic relationships mapped and lensing items documented
- Ready for project execution with Owner/PM confirmation of outstanding gaps

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Owner/PM review and confirmation of assumption-based requirements
2. Completion of AHJ and code reference enumerations
3. Establishment of performance metrics and objective acceptance criteria for ambiguous items
4. CCDC 14-2013 Appendix J review and supplementary condition confirmation
5. Project kick-off meetings to finalize format standards, document templates, and process details

## Conclusion

PKG-001 General Requirements & Delivery Controls represents a comprehensive and well-structured foundation for project delivery across the Town of Penhold Public Services Building Design-Build project. The seven deliverables cover all major administrative, technical, and quality management obligations required under RFP 2024_004 and CCDC 14-2013.

**Key Readiness Assessment:**
- **Specification Completeness:** High — all requirements documented with clear sourcing and verification approaches
- **Implementation Readiness:** Conditional — multiple assumptions and TBD items require Owner/PM confirmation before execution
- **Risk Profile:** Moderate — gaps in performance metrics, objective acceptance criteria, and external reference enumeration (AHJs, codes) present execution risk if not resolved early

**Recommendation:** Conduct Owner/Project Manager review and confirmation of all assumption-based requirements and TBD items prior to project award. Incorporate confirmed items into contract supplementary conditions (Appendix J) and project kick-off meeting agendas to establish clear baseline for all parties.
