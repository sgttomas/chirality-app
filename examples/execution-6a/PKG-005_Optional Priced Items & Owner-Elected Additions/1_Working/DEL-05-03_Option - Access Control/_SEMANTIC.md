# Deliverable: DEL-05-03 Option -- Access Control

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable must carry sufficient knowledge to support an informed Owner election decision regarding optional access control for a shared municipal facility. It presents a zoning concept, device schedule, and separable pricing that balances interdepartmental access management needs against cost transparency, code compliance, and base building integration. The semantic lens conditions all categories, types, behaviors, and values toward the optional-scope framing where design resolution must be credible at proposal stage without constituting final engineering.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**
