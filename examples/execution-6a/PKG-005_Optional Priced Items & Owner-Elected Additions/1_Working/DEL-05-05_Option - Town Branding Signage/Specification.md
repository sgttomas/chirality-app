# Specification: DEL-05-05 — Option: Town Branding Signage

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable covers the optional priced Town of Penhold branding signage for the main building exterior. It includes:
- A concept-level branding signage design (visual intent, sign types proposed).
- Proposed sign locations on the main building exterior.
- A separable, itemized pricing sheet for the optional branding signage scope.

Source: OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; SOW-0504 (Decomposition Scope Ledger).

### Out of Scope
- All code-required interior and exterior signage — this is base scope (SOW-0229; OSR §10.3.11 RFP p.42; OSR §12.5 RFP p.45). Base signage must be carried in base price regardless of whether this option is elected.
- Branding signage for cold storage or ancillary buildings — OSR §12.5 specifies the main building; ancillary building inclusion is not stated. **ASSUMPTION:** Ancillary buildings are excluded from this option unless Owner directs otherwise.
- Town branding standards document or Town-supplied artwork — not provided in RFP; Design-Builder must seek these from the Town during design. **TBD** pending Owner direction.

### Terminology Note
Throughout this document and related DEL-05-05 documents, the preferred term is **"branding signage"** to describe Town of Penhold identity signage beyond code requirements. Related terms such as "identity signage," "Town branding," "civic branding," and "municipal branding" are used synonymously where context requires variation, but "branding signage" is the normative term for this deliverable scope. (Ref: Lensing item F-003)

## Standards

| Standard / Requirement | Applicability | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alberta Building Code (ABC) — signage requirements | Base scope (code-required signage); indirectly bounds optional scope; structural adequacy for sign mounting | OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42) — **TBD**: specific edition not stated in RFP; confirm applicable edition with Owner/code consultant (Ref: Lensing item F-001) | Code-required signage stays in base; optional branding must not duplicate or conflict; structural loads per applicable ABC edition. This standard is materially important because it governs the structural design of sign attachment systems. |
| Town of Penhold signage/branding requirements | Directly applicable | OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42); OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45) | Specific Town branding standards not provided in RFP — **TBD**. Design-Builder must obtain during proposal period (Step A2) or confirm post-award. Town branding standards are essential to ensure identity alignment and prevent costly post-award redesign. |
| Applicable Alberta/federal accessibility signage standards | Directly applicable to optional branding signage if branding elements serve wayfinding or identification functions that trigger accessibility requirements. Confirmation required by code consultant. | OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42) | Accessibility standards definitively apply to code-required base signage (SOW-0229). For supplementary branding signage, confirm with code consultant during design whether any proposed branding sign types (e.g., departmental identification, wayfinding with branding) trigger accessibility requirements. (Ref: Lensing item A-001) |
| Sign fabrication quality and industry standards | Directly applicable to optional branding signage fabrication and installation | OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44): "Use durable, flexible materials for longevity and easy maintenance." **ASSUMPTION** that this principle applies to branding signage as permanent exterior building elements. Industry sign fabrication best practice (e.g., ISA sign standards, ULC standards for illuminated signs) applies. **TBD** — specific industry standard reference to be confirmed. (Ref: Lensing item E-001) | Minimum quality expectations for materials, finishes, and fabrication workmanship for permanent exterior municipal signage include: (a) material durability for Alberta climate (cold, wind, UV, moisture, freeze-thaw); (b) finish consistency and quality; (c) structural attachment integrity; (d) ease of maintenance and component replacement. |
