## Prerequisites

### For Proposal Production (Phase A)
- Access to RFP and OSR (Appendix A), specifically OSR §10.3.11 and §12.5.
- Access to site plan and main building concept to determine available exterior sign locations.
- Town of Penhold branding/identity guidelines (logo files, colour palette, approved sign families) — **TBD**: request from Owner via RFP §2.8 contact. If not available prior to proposal close, proceed with best-effort based on publicly available Town branding. See Guidance C3 for timeline considerations. (Ref: Lensing item A-002)
- Understanding of code-required base signage scope (OSR §10.3.11; SOW-0229) to define the boundary accurately.
- Determination of whether illuminated signage is in scope — **TBD**: if illumination is proposed, this affects concept design, pricing, and electrical coordination at proposal stage (not only post-award). See Guidance TBD-02. (Ref: Lensing item A-003; SourcePath: Procedure.md, Step B3)

### For Option Implementation (Post-Award, Phase B)
- Owner election of this optional item (written direction or contract amendment).
- Town of Penhold branding guidelines confirmed and provided (logo files, standards document).
- Architectural design of main building exterior (facade geometry, material, mounting surfaces) at sufficient maturity to finalize sign locations and dimensions.
- Base signage design confirmed (to ensure no duplication or conflict).

No upstream dependencies are formally declared in `_DEPENDENCIES.md`. The following are identified as practical prerequisites by **ASSUMPTION**:
- DEL-02-01 (Architectural Program and Space Planning) — main building exterior design informs sign locations.
- Coordination with base signage design (SOW-0229 scope) to confirm boundary.

## Steps

### Phase A — Proposal Stage (Producing the DEL-05-05 Artifacts)

**Step A1 — Establish Scope Boundary**
Review OSR §10.3.11 (base signage) and OSR §12.5 (optional branding) side by side. Document what is base (code-required) and what is optional (branding signage beyond code). Prepare a one-paragraph scope boundary statement for inclusion in the proposal.

- Source: OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42); OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); SOW-0229; SOW-0504.

**Step A2 — Obtain or Reference Town Branding Guidelines**
Contact the Owner's representative (per RFP §2.8) to request Town of Penhold branding guidelines. Specify a requested response date that allows incorporation into the proposal concept. If received, use them to inform the concept. If not received before proposal close, note in the proposal that brand alignment will be confirmed post-award, and base the concept on publicly available Town branding (website, existing facilities).

- Source: OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45) — branding alignment required; guidelines **TBD**. (Ref: Lensing item A-002 for timeline clarification)

**Step A3 — Develop Branding Signage Concept**
Develop a concept-level representation of proposed branding signage for the main building exterior. The concept must include at minimum:
- At least one visual representation (annotated sketch, rendering, or graphic illustration) showing proposed sign types in context with the building exterior.
- Proposed sign types (e.g., primary building identification, departmental identification, entry branding) with approximate dimensions.
- Design intent (materials, finishes, colour reference to Town palette, logo application method).
- Relationship to building architecture (how signs integrate with facade design).

If illuminated signage is proposed, identify illumination type and note electrical coordination requirements.

Keep at concept level — detailed shop drawings are not required at proposal stage.

- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts: "Branding signage concept"; OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45). (Ref: Lensing item C-002 for minimum maturity; Lensing item A-003 for illumination)

**Step A4 — Identify Sign Locations**
Using the main building concept design/site plan, identify proposed locations for each branding signage element on the main building exterior. Prepare a simple location plan (sketch, annotated elevation, or narrative description) showing where each sign type is proposed.

- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts: "Locations"; OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45).

**Step A5 — Prepare Pricing Sheet**
Prepare an itemized pricing sheet for the optional branding signage scope. The sheet must:
- List each branding signage element (by sign type and location).
- Include supply, fabrication, and installation costs separately per item.
- Show quantities for each sign type.
- Provide subtotals per sign type and a total optional price for the full branding signage package.
- Be clearly labeled as a separate optional item (not included in base price).
- **Basis of estimate and pricing assumptions:** State explicitly whether the pricing is allowance, budget estimate, or firm pricing. Note any pricing assumptions that could change if branding guidelines, illumination scope, or sign types change post-award (e.g., "Pricing assumes non-illuminated signs; illumination adds $X per sign," or "Pricing subject to confirmation when Town branding standards are provided"). This transparency allows the Owner to understand the confidence level of the estimate and plan for potential adjustments. See Guidance C5 for cost estimation approach. (Ref: Lensing item F-002; Lensing item X-001)

- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts: "Pricing sheet"; OBJ-010; SOW-0504.

**Step A6 — Quality-Check Scope Boundary**
Before submission, verify that:
- No code-required signage is double-counted in the optional item.
- The scope boundary statement in the proposal is consistent with the pricing sheet.
- The pricing sheet is clearly separated from base scope pricing.
- The concept visual representation demonstrates adequate design intent (see REQ-05-05-04 minimum maturity).

- Source: OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); REQ-05-05-01; REQ-05-05-02; REQ-05-05-04.

**Step A7 — Assemble and Submit**
Assemble the three artifacts (concept, locations, pricing sheet) and the scope boundary statement into the proposal submission per RFP §4 and §5 requirements. Confirm the optional item is correctly positioned in the proposal format.

- Source: RFP §4.2–§4.3 (Proposal Format and Content); RFP §5 (Submission of Proposals).

### Phase B — Implementation Stage (Post-Award, if Option is Elected)

**Step B1 — Confirm Owner Election**
Receive written Owner direction electing the optional branding signage scope (contract amendment or Owner-Elected Additions schedule). Confirm the elected scope matches the proposal pricing sheet.

- Source: PKG-005 Package Definition (Decomposition Phase 4); OSR §12.5.

**Step B2 — Obtain Confirmed Branding Guidelines**
Obtain Town of Penhold's confirmed branding guidelines (logo files in vector format, colour specifications, typography standards, approved sign families). If guidelines have changed since proposal, flag any scope/cost implications for Owner review.

- Source: OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); REQ-05-05-08.

**Step B3 — Coordinate with Architectural Design and Confirm Structural Adequacy**
Coordinate branding signage design with the architectural and structural teams to:
1. **Facade coordination:** Confirm final exterior facade geometry, materials, mounting surfaces, and available mounting locations for proposed sign types.
2. **Structural attachment requirements (REQ-05-05-09):** Work with structural engineer to confirm structural adequacy of sign mounting systems for all proposed locations, including:
   - Wind load calculations per applicable Alberta Building Code edition (ABC **TBD** — confirm edition).
   - Snow load considerations appropriate for Penhold, Alberta latitude and elevation.
   - Seismic forces (if applicable per ABC).
   - Substrate compatibility and fastener selection for facade materials.
   - Anchorage and bearing capacity of mounting locations.
   - Document structural attachment calculations and confirm adequate safety factors per ABC.
3. **Illumination scope (if applicable):** If illuminated signage is proposed in Step A3, coordinate electrical requirements with the electrical team:
   - Power supply location and voltage requirements.
   - Wiring routing within building or on facade.
   - Dimming/control requirements.
   - Note that illumination decisions and electrical coordination must occur at this stage (not deferred to fabrication).

**Verification requirement:** Complete structural attachment calculations and documentation. Do not proceed to Step B4 detailed design without confirmed structural adequacy.

- Source: **ASSUMPTION** based on standard signage design-build coordination. (Ref: Lensing item D-001 for structural adequacy; Lensing item A-003 for illumination; Specification REQ-05-05-09)

**Step B4 — Prepare Detailed Sign Design and Shop Drawings**
Develop detailed sign design drawings including:
- Dimensions (height, width, depth, letter/graphic sizing).
- Materials, finishes, colours (with reference to Town branding palette).
- Structural attachment details (substrate, fasteners, anchorage).
- Electrical requirements (if illuminated): wiring diagram, power supply, controls.
- Fabrication specifications (tolerances, quality standards, testing requirements).

Submit for Owner/Town review and approval before proceeding to Step B4a.

- Source: **ASSUMPTION** based on standard post-award design-build signage deliverable. (Ref: Lensing item D-001 for structural adequacy)

**Step B4a — Owner/Town Design Review and Approval Hold Point (MANDATORY)**

**Purpose of this hold point:** This is a critical gate between detailed design and fabrication commitment. It prevents costly rework by obtaining design approval from decision-makers before fabrication begins.

**Actions required:**
1. Submit detailed sign designs (Step B4 drawings) to Owner and Town of Penhold for joint review and approval.
2. The **Town of Penhold** must confirm:
   - Proposed signs align with Town branding standards and identity guidelines.
   - Logo applications, colours, typography match Town-approved branding.
   - Proposed sign types and locations align with Town civic branding vision.
3. The **Owner** must confirm:
   - Detailed design is consistent with proposal concept intent (in terms of sign types, scale, materials, locations).
   - No material scope/cost changes have occurred since proposal concept (if changes identified, document and agree to cost adjustment).
   - Fabrication can proceed with approved design.

**Hold point condition:** Do not proceed to fabrication (Step B5) until both Owner and Town have issued written approval of the detailed designs.

**Rationale:** For municipal branding signage, Town identity approval is critical and must occur before fabrication commitment. This intermediate review prevents costly post-fabrication redesign if the fabricated signs do not meet Town branding expectations or if the design has drifted from the proposal concept intent. It also protects the Owner by ensuring concept-to-completion fidelity. (Ref: Lensing item X-002; Lensing item D-002; SourcePath: Procedure.md, Steps B4, B5, B6; Guidance.md, E2)

- Source: **ASSUMPTION** based on standard design-build practice and the critical importance of Town identity approval for municipal branding signage.

**Step B5 — Fabrication and Installation**
Fabricate signs per approved design drawings. Install at confirmed locations per structural attachment details. Ensure all signs:
- Comply with applicable legislation and Town of Penhold requirements (REQ-05-05-07).
- Meet structural adequacy requirements for the mounting location (REQ-05-05-09).
- Meet fabrication quality and workmanship standards (REQ-05-05-10).

- Source: OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42); REQ-05-05-07; REQ-05-05-09; REQ-05-05-10.

**Step B6 — Owner Review and Acceptance**
Present installed branding signage to Owner for review and acceptance. The Owner should assess whether the final installed signage is consistent with the proposal concept intent and the approved detailed design (Step B4a). Address any deficiencies identified by the Owner.
