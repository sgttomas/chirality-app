# Guidance: DEL-05-05 — Option: Town Branding Signage

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to allow the Town of Penhold to optionally add municipal branding signage to the main Public Services Building exterior, beyond the code-required signage that is carried in base scope. By pricing this separately, the Owner can elect or defer the branding scope based on budget, priority, and design development, without affecting the base contract.

### Terminology Convention
The preferred term for this deliverable scope is **"branding signage"** — referring to Town of Penhold identity signage beyond code requirements. Related terms ("identity signage," "Town branding," "civic branding," "municipal branding") are used synonymously where context requires variation, but "branding signage" is the normative term across all DEL-05-05 documents. This convention is established to prevent terminology drift in downstream documents and coordination interfaces.

## Principles

### P1 — Transparent Separation from Base Scope
The single most important principle for this deliverable is clarity of scope boundary. Code-required signage (interior and exterior, per legislation and Town requirements) is base scope — it must be priced and delivered regardless of whether this option is elected. Optional branding signage is everything beyond that: Town identity elements, logo applications, building name features, and similar civic branding. The proposal must make this boundary unambiguous so the Owner can evaluate each independently.

Source: OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42); OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); SOW-0229; SOW-0504.

### P2 — Concept Clarity Over Detailed Design
At proposal stage, the Design-Builder is required to submit a concept-level response — not detailed construction drawings. The concept should communicate design intent (what the branding signage will look like, where it will go, and what it will cost) clearly enough for the Owner to make an informed election decision. Over-engineering the proposal response wastes effort; under-developing it risks rejection or inability to evaluate.

Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45) — **ASSUMPTION** based on "4-doc bundle" optional scope package type and proposal-stage context.

### P3 — Alignment with Town Identity
Branding signage for a municipal facility should align with the Town of Penhold's established visual identity. The RFP does not provide a branding standards document; the Design-Builder should proactively request Town branding guidelines (logo files, colour palette, typography standards, preferred sign families) from the Owner. Using the Town's existing branding reduces the risk of post-award redesign.

Source: OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45): "Town of Penhold signage and branding"; OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42): "in compliance with all legislation and Town of Penhold requirements."

### P4 — Durability, Weather Resistance, and Lifecycle Performance
Signage on a municipal building exterior in Penhold, Alberta must withstand the local climate (cold winters, snow loads, wind, UV exposure). The branding signage concept should propose materials and construction methods appropriate for exterior Alberta conditions. Beyond initial durability, the Design-Builder should consider lifecycle performance: materials and construction methods that minimize long-term maintenance burden (e.g., fading, delamination, corrosion) and facilitate eventual replacement or refurbishment are preferred for a public facility with a multi-decade service life.

Source: OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44): "Use durable, flexible materials for longevity and easy maintenance" — **ASSUMPTION** that this general materials principle applies to signage as exterior building elements. (Ref: Lensing item B-003 for lifecycle extension)

## Considerations

### C1 — What Constitutes "Branding Signage"
The RFP does not enumerate the types or quantities of branding signage elements expected. The Design-Builder must define what is being offered. Typical municipal branding signage elements for a facility of this type may include:
- Building name/identification sign (primary exterior fascia or monument sign)
- Departmental identification (Fire Hall, Public Works)
- Town crest or logo applications
- Directional/wayfinding elements that carry Town brand colours or identity

**ASSUMPTION:** The above are illustrative examples. The actual scope is to be proposed by the Design-Builder and confirmed with the Owner. The RFP provides no enumerated list.

### C2 — Relationship to Base Signage
Code-required signage (exit signs, occupancy signs, accessible signage, address identification required by code or bylaw) stays in base regardless of this option. The optional branding signage overlaps conceptually — some sign types (e.g., building name) may have both a code-required element (address) and a branding element (Town logo/identity treatment). The Design-Builder must be careful to price only the branding increment as optional, not the entire sign if a code-required version would exist in any case.

Source: OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42); SOW-0229 (Decomposition Scope Ledger).

### C3 — Owner's Brand Guidelines Are Not in the RFP
The RFP does not attach Town of Penhold branding standards or provide logo files. The Design-Builder should:
1. Request these from the Town during the proposal period (via the Owner's representative per RFP §2.8) or at award.
2. In the absence of guidelines, reference publicly visible Town branding (website, existing facilities) as a design starting point.
3. Flag in the proposal that detailed branding design is subject to Town brand guideline confirmation post-award.

**TBD** — Town branding guidelines availability, content, and timeline for provision. Specifically: is there a deadline within the proposal period for providing brand guidelines, or is this entirely a post-award activity? If post-award, the proposal concept is necessarily preliminary and the pricing sheet should include an appropriate allowance for design refinement. (Ref: Lensing item A-002; SourcePath: Guidance.md, C3; Procedure.md, Step A2)

### C4 — Pricing Structure for an Owner-Elected Option
Because this is an Owner-elected optional item, the pricing sheet must be structured to allow the Owner to add or remove the entire branding signage scope cleanly. The pricing should be lump-sum (or broken into discrete sub-items if multiple sign types are proposed), and must not be entangled with base scope costs.

Source: OBJ-010 (Decomposition Objectives Table); PKG-005 Package Definition (Decomposition Phase 4).

### C5 — Cost Estimation Approach at Concept Stage
At proposal stage, sign types, dimensions, and materials are largely TBD (Design-Builder proposed). This creates inherent uncertainty in pricing. The Design-Builder should consider the following approaches to cost estimation for the pricing sheet:
- **Basis of estimate:** State explicitly in the pricing sheet whether pricing is based on allowance (estimated scope with adjustment mechanism post-award), budget pricing (order-of-magnitude for Owner decision-making), or firm pricing (fixed price for defined scope). Clarity on basis of estimate allows the Owner to understand the pricing confidence level and the risk of change orders post-award.
- **Allowance vs. firm pricing:** Where sign types and quantities are proposed but not confirmed by the Owner/Town, consider presenting pricing as an allowance with a stated scope basis (e.g., "three sign types assumed; if final branding guidelines result in additional types, cost will be adjusted"). This approach is more transparent than firm pricing that may not survive post-award branding confirmation.
- **Contingency for TBD items:** If illumination, structural complexity, or branding guidelines could materially change scope, include a stated contingency or explicitly note the pricing assumptions that could change (e.g., "Pricing assumes non-illuminated signs; illumination adds $X per sign," or "Pricing assumes 3 sign types; final Town standards may add departmental signs not shown in concept").
- **Per-item granularity:** The pricing sheet must be itemized per sign type (REQ-05-05-06), which inherently supports scope adjustment if the Owner elects only a subset (e.g., primary building identification only, without departmental signs).

**Rationale:** Transparent cost estimation at concept stage reduces post-award disputes and change orders. When the Owner understands which pricing is firm and which may change, they can make an informed election decision and budget accordingly.

Source: **ASSUMPTION** based on standard design-build estimating practice for concept-stage optional items. (Ref: Lensing item F-002; SourcePath: Procedure.md, Step A5; Guidance.md, C4)

### C6 — Lifecycle Maintenance and Replacement
For a municipal public facility with a multi-decade service life, the Design-Builder should consider lifecycle maintenance implications when proposing branding signage materials and construction methods:
- **Routine maintenance:** Cleaning, repainting/refinishing, re-laminating vinyl or printed graphics.
- **Component replacement:** LED modules or transformers for illuminated signs; faded or damaged panel replacement.
- **Vandalism repair:** Ease of repair or panel replacement if signage is damaged.
- **End-of-life replacement:** Modular construction that allows individual sign replacement without facade damage.

These considerations inform both the concept design and the pricing sheet (lifecycle cost visibility supports Owner decision-making). While not explicitly required by the RFP, lifecycle thinking is consistent with P4 (durability) and the general materials principle in OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44). (Ref: Lensing item B-003; SourcePath: Guidance.md, Principles P4; Considerations section)

## Trade-offs

### T1 — Concept Specificity vs. Proposal Risk
**Tension:** A highly detailed branding concept in the proposal demonstrates commitment and creativity but risks being misaligned with the Town's actual brand preferences, requiring redesign after award. A minimal concept reduces effort but may score lower in proposal evaluation.

**Resolution:** Propose a concept that demonstrates intent and competence without committing to final details. State clearly that the concept is subject to Town brand guideline review and Owner approval post-award.

**Source:** **ASSUMPTION** based on proposal-stage context and typical design-build practice.

### T2 — Scope Boundary Ambiguity (Code vs. Branding)
**Tension:** Some signage elements sit at the boundary between code-required (base) and branding (optional). Including them in base risks under-selling the option; including them in the option risks appearing to charge twice.

**Resolution:** Where a sign type has both a code-required function and a branding overlay, price the code-required version as base and the branding increment (upgraded finish, logo addition, custom font, etc.) as the optional item. State this distinction explicitly in the proposal.

**Source:** OSR §12.5 (RFP p.45); OSR §10.3.11 (RFP p.42).

## Examples

### Example — Scope Boundary Statement (illustrative)
> "Base scope includes all code-required interior and exterior signage per ABC and Town bylaw (exit signs, occupancy placards, accessible signage, address identification). The optional branding signage item (DEL-05-05) covers: one (1) primary building identification fascia sign with Town of Penhold crest and wordmark; two (2) departmental identification signs (Fire Hall / Public Works); and Town-branded directional wayfinding at main entry. Total optional price: $[TBD]."

**Note:** This is illustrative only. Actual scope, quantities, and price are **TBD** and must be determined by the Design-Builder based on Town branding guidelines and site-specific design.

## Owner Evaluation Considerations

The following guidance addresses how the Owner may evaluate the branding signage option. No explicit evaluation criteria or scoring weight for this optional item are stated in the RFP. The Design-Builder should consider the following when calibrating the level of effort and detail in the proposal concept:

### E1 — Election Decision Framework
The Owner's decision to elect this option will likely be based on the following factors:
- **(a) Value relative to cost:** Does the proposed branding signage concept justify the optional price relative to the Owner's priorities and budget? The Design-Builder should present a concept that demonstrates clear design intent and architectural integration so the Owner can assess perceived value.
- **(b) Alignment with Town identity goals:** Does the proposed concept align with the Town's established branding and identity vision? The Design-Builder should proactively obtain Town branding guidelines (per Procedure Step A2) and ensure the concept references the Town's visual identity system.
- **(c) Budget availability and priority:** Are funds available for this optional scope? The Design-Builder's clear scope boundary statement and transparent pricing structure support this assessment.
- **Evaluation criteria:** **TBD** — The RFP does not state whether this optional item is evaluated on technical merit (with scoring weight), or whether the Owner decision is purely based on budget availability after mandatory base requirements are evaluated. The Design-Builder should seek clarification during the proposal period (RFP §2.8).

### E2 — Concept-to-Completion Fidelity
Post-award, the Owner will need a basis for determining whether the final installed branding signage matches the value proposition and design intent of the original proposal concept. To enable this assessment:
- **Concept parameters:** The Design-Builder should establish, at concept stage, the key design parameters that define the concept scope: sign types proposed, approximate dimensions/scale, material family, colour/finish treatment, branding approach (logo placement, typography reference, etc.). These parameters form the basis against which final installed work will be assessed.
- **Design review hold point:** Procedure Step B4a establishes a mandatory Owner/Town design review and approval before fabrication begins. This hold point allows the Owner to confirm that detailed designs remain consistent with the proposal concept intent before fabrication commitment. **TBD** — Owner to confirm whether this intermediate review will include a concept-fidelity assessment and whether design changes post-hold point trigger scope/cost adjustments. (Ref: Lensing item D-002; SourcePath: Procedure.md, Step B6; Specification.md)
- **Deficiency closure:** Any deviation from the proposal concept identified at final Owner review (Procedure Step B6) should be documented, with the Design-Builder responsible for rework or cost adjustment per RFP §7.3.7 (Deficiencies).

### E3 — Calibrating Proposal Effort
Without stated evaluation criteria or scoring weight, the Design-Builder should aim for a concept that achieves balance:
- Sufficient to demonstrate competence, design sensitivity, and a credible cost basis.
- Clear enough to allow Owner evaluation and decision-making.
- Detailed enough to support a realistic pricing estimate.
- Flexible enough that the concept can be refined post-award when Town branding guidelines are confirmed.
- **Not** over-invested in details that are certain to change post-award when branding guidelines become available.

A well-executed concept includes a visual representation (sketch or rendering), description of sign types and locations, material/finish approach, and a transparent itemized pricing sheet with stated basis of estimate. This level of documentation demonstrates professional competence without unnecessary rework.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No conflicts identified at this stage. The base/optional boundary is clearly stated in OSR §12.5 and §10.3.11.

### Open TBD Items Requiring Human Ruling

| TBD ID | Question | Impacted Documents | Proposed Resolution Path | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TBD-01 | When and how will Town of Penhold branding guidelines be obtained? Is there a deadline within the proposal period, or is this entirely post-award? | Guidance C3; Procedure Step A2 | Owner / Town of Penhold to confirm timeline | Lensing A-002; OSR §12.5 |
| TBD-02 | Is illuminated signage in scope? If so, electrical coordination requirements must be addressed at proposal stage (affects concept, pricing, and coordination). | Procedure Step B3; Specification REQ-05-05-04 | Design-Builder / Owner to determine during proposal period | Lensing A-003; Procedure Step B3 |
| TBD-03 | What evaluation criteria or scoring weight, if any, apply to optional priced items? | Guidance (Owner Evaluation); Specification REQ-05-05-04 | Owner to confirm | Lensing A-004 |
| TBD-04 | What is the applicable edition of the Alberta Building Code for this project? | Specification Standards table; REQ-05-05-09 | Owner / RFP clarification | Lensing F-001; OSR §10.3.11 |
| TBD-05 | Does §10.3.11 compliance obligation definitively apply to optional branding signage? | Specification REQ-05-05-07 | Owner to confirm | Lensing C-001; OSR §10.3.11 |

If Town branding guidelines produce requirements that conflict with the base signage scope (e.g., Town requires a specific sign type that is also code-required), the Design-Builder should flag this as a Conflict for Owner resolution at that time.
