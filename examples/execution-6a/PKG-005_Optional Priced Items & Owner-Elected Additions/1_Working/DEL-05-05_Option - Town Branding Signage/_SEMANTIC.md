# Deliverable: DEL-05-05 Option -- Town Branding Signage

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides an optional, separately-priced municipal branding signage package for a public building exterior, requiring the proposal to establish a clear boundary between code-required base signage and discretionary identity elements, present a concept-level design with locations, and deliver transparent itemized pricing that enables the Owner to independently elect or defer the branding scope.
