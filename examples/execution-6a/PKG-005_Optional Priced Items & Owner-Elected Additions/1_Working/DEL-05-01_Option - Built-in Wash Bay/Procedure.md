# Procedure: DEL-05-01 — Option: Built-in Wash Bay

## Purpose

This procedure describes:
1. **Production** — how the Design-Builder develops and assembles the four deliverable artifacts (concept layout, equipment list, containment concept, pricing sheet) for the Built-in Wash Bay option.
2. **Implementation** — how the wash bay is designed, constructed, and placed in service if the Owner elects the option.

## Steps

### Phase A: Deliverable Production (Proposal Stage)

**Step 1 — Review Requirements and Fleet Data**
- Read OSR §12.1 (RFP p.44): confirm wash bay is permanent, equipment-equipped, containment-required, located in 4th PW bay.
- Read Addendum 03 §1.9: confirm wash bay is a separate additional item from the general building proposal.
- Review RFP Appendix B (Public Works Critical Design Equipment List, pp.47–48): extract the largest vehicle dimensions (height, width, length, turning radius) to establish minimum bay clearances.
- Note the absence of an on-site storm sewer (OSR §11.2) as a drainage constraint.

**Step 2 — Establish Bay Configuration Basis**
- Determine wash bay orientation: drive-through (two overhead doors) or single-entry (one overhead door). Evaluate against fleet vehicle dimensions and turning constraints.
- Establish minimum interior bay dimensions: width (≥ widest vehicle + operating clearance), length (≥ longest vehicle or drive-through length), clear height (≥ tallest vehicle in wash position).
- Confirm overhead door height: minimum 16' per Addendum 03 §1.10. Confirm door width against widest vehicle (including grader moldboard when applicable).
- Resolve or flag the sweeper-hopper-raised height question (CONF-WB-02) — state assumption in the concept.
- *Source: OSR §12.1; Addendum 03 §1.10; RFP Appendix B*

**Step 3 — Develop Concept Layout**
- Produce a floor plan (and section if needed) showing:
  - Wash bay location within the PW bay area (fourth bay position)
  - Bay interior dimensions and clear height
  - Overhead door location(s) and size(s)
  - Wash equipment footprint/layout (boom, nozzle points, hose drops, etc.)
  - Sump location and drain layout
  - Containment elements (trench drains, interceptor location if in-bay)
  - Interface with adjacent bays and main building structure
- Label all dimensions. Note which elements are base-scope (bay shell, OH door, sump) vs. wash-bay-option scope (equipment, containment upgrades, plumbing, etc.).
- *Source: _CONTEXT.md — Anticipated Artifacts; OSR §12.1*

**Step 3a (New) — Develop HVAC and Ventilation Requirements**
- Identify ventilation design inputs required for the wash bay:
  - Required air exchange rate for moisture extraction (consult Alberta Building Code minimum for enclosed wash bays in cold climates)
  - Heated air requirement (ventilation air shall be pre-heated to prevent condensation and ice formation)
  - Ducting and exhaust locations
- Document as a design input for the mechanical discipline lead
- Flag any code sections as TBD if exact ABC section not yet identified
- *Source: Datasheet — Construction (Ventilation row); Guidance — HVAC and Moisture Management; Added per lensing item A-004*

**Step 4 — Prepare Equipment List**
- List proposed wash equipment with:
  - Equipment type (pressure washer, boom, underbody wash, recirculating unit, etc.)
  - Brief description and basis (functional description, not a detailed specification at this stage)
  - Supplier category (if known; not required at proposal stage)
- List containment and drainage components (trench drains, interceptor, sump pump, etc.)
- *Source: OSR §12.1 — "including equipment"; _CONTEXT.md*

**Step 5 — Develop Containment Concept**
- Describe the debris and moisture containment approach:
  - How wash water and debris are captured at the floor level
  - Drainage path from floor to collection point
  - Effluent management approach (oil-water separator, holding tank, treatment system, or recirculating system)
  - Off-site disposal or treatment method (noting no on-site storm sewer)
- Identify any regulatory requirements being addressed (AEP, municipal bylaw, plumbing code).
- Flag any unresolved regulatory questions as TBD requiring confirmation with AHJ or AEP.
- *Source: OSR §12.1; OSR §11.2*

**Step 6 — Prepare Separable Pricing Sheet**
- Compile all wash-bay-option costs into a standalone pricing sheet:
  - Structural/civil increments (enhanced floor slab, containment pit, etc.)
  - Wash equipment supply and installation
  - Mechanical/plumbing (water supply, drain, containment system, interceptor/tank)
  - Electrical (power to wash equipment, lighting upgrades if any)
  - HVAC increments (if wash bay requires dedicated heating or ventilation above base bay)
  - General conditions and overhead attributable to the wash bay option
  - Contingency and markup
- Format the sheet to stand alone from the base proposal. Include assumptions and exclusions.
- *Source: SOW-0500; OBJ-010; _CONTEXT.md*

**Step 7 — Internal Review and Consistency Check**
- Cross-check concept layout, equipment list, containment concept, and pricing sheet for internal consistency:
  - Equipment on the list is shown on the layout
  - Containment elements on the layout are priced on the pricing sheet
  - Assumptions are consistent across all four artifacts
- Verify that the pricing sheet contains no base-scope items
- Confirm that the deliverable package is clearly marked as an optional item separate from the base proposal

**Step 7a (New) — Formal Review and Approval Gate**
- Conduct formal internal review of the complete wash bay deliverable package with:
  - Discipline leads (architectural, mechanical, structural, electrical)
  - Pricing function representative
  - Proposal document coordinator
- Establish sign-off/approval by each discipline lead confirming:
  - Discipline-specific scope is complete and accurate
  - Assumptions are clearly identified
  - Technical approach is feasible and cost-realistic
- Record approval signatures or email confirmations in project files before package is finalized

### Phase B: Design and Construction (Post-Award, if Option Elected)

**Step 8 — Confirm Option Election and Scope Boundary**
- Owner formally elects the wash bay option (or confirms at contract execution)
- Confirm the exact scope boundary: which elements are base scope, which are wash-bay option increments
- Establish change management approach if Owner makes modifications to the elected option

**Step 9 — Regulatory and Environmental Confirmation**
- Confirm effluent management approach with AHJ and AEP as required
- Obtain any environmental approvals or confirmations needed for wash water discharge/disposal
- Confirm plumbing permit scope with local building authority

**Step 10 — Detailed Design**
- Develop detailed design drawings and specifications for all wash bay elements:
  - Structural drawings (enhanced slab, containment, drainage penetrations)
  - Plumbing drawings (water supply, hot water, drains, interceptor/separator, effluent line)
  - Mechanical/HVAC drawings (heated air, ventilation, moisture control)
  - Electrical drawings (wash equipment circuits, lighting, GFCI protection)
  - Equipment specification (wash system, pressure rating, capacity, controls)
- Coordinate with base building detailed design for structural and mechanical interfaces

**Step 11 — Procurement of Wash Equipment**
- Issue equipment specifications and obtain quotes/orders for wash system components
- Confirm lead times and coordinate with construction schedule
- Obtain Owner acceptance of selected equipment if required

**Step 12 — Construction**
- Install enhanced slab and containment elements before floor finish
- Install drainage, interceptor/separator, and plumbing rough-in during slab/below-grade phase
- Install wash equipment per manufacturer's requirements after structural work is complete
- Install electrical connections per permit
- Install overhead door(s) consistent with base building specification

**Step 13 — Commissioning**
- Test wash equipment per manufacturer commissioning requirements; establish and document acceptance criteria:
  - **Equipment performance test:** operate wash system at design pressure/flow rate and confirm nozzles, hoses, and boom function; acceptance: all functions operate as specified
  - **Drainage flow test:** run water through the wash system and confirm drainage flows to the collection point without backup; acceptance: drainage capacity ≥ design wash flow rate with no flooding
  - **Containment integrity test:** run water and confirm no uncontrolled escape from the bay or containment sump; acceptance: all water is contained and directed to the disposal system
- Test overhead door operation; confirm proper opening/closing and safety interlocks
- Confirm effluent management system is functional and compliant with AEP or municipal requirements
- Record all commissioning test results and sign-off
