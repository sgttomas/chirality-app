# Specification: DEL-05-01 — Option: Built-in Wash Bay

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable covers the Design-Builder's proposal for a built-in vehicle wash bay as an **optional priced item** for the Penhold Public Services Building (PSB). The wash bay is intended to replace the fourth bay in the Public Works equipment bays and provide permanent washing facilities with containment of debris and moisture. The deliverable comprises:
- A concept layout of the wash bay within the PW bay area
- An equipment list for wash and containment components
- A containment concept narrative/diagram
- A separable pricing sheet clearly distinguishing this option from base scope

*Source: OSR §12.1 (RFP p.44); SOW-0500; _CONTEXT.md*

### Out of Scope
- Base-scope shop bays and their sumps (separate deliverables under PKG-002)
- Pickled sand storage building (removed from procurement; SOW-0400, Addendum 03 §1.2)
- Access control, security/cameras, yard lighting, branding signage, and appliances (separate optional items SOW-0501–SOW-0506)
- Detailed design and construction documents (IFC-level drawings and specifications; these are post-award deliverables)

*Source (vehicles): RFP Appendix B, pp.47–48*

### REQ-WB-06: Overhead Door Height (ASSUMPTION)
The wash bay entry overhead door shall be a **minimum 16 feet** in height, consistent with the base building door standard.
**ASSUMPTION:** The 16' minimum door height stated for main building doors (Addendum 03 §1.10) applies to the wash bay. Exact door width TBD to accommodate fleet vehicles.

*Source: Addendum 03 §1.8*

### REQ-WB-08: Drainage — No On-Site Storm Sewer
The wash bay drainage design shall account for the absence of an on-site storm sewer. Effluent management strategy (treatment, holding, off-site disposal) shall be proposed by the Design-Builder and comply with applicable regulations.
*Source: OSR §11.2 — "Since there is no storm sewer on-site, ensure efficient drainage of freshwater flow from the roof structures away to appropriate natural drainage off site."*

### REQ-WB-09: Separable Pricing
The wash bay option shall be priced **separately** from the base scope proposal so the Owner can elect it independently.
*Source: SOW-0500 — "Provide as separate priced option"; OBJ-010*

### REQ-WB-10: Code Compliance
All elements of the wash bay design shall comply with the applicable Alberta Building Code (ABC), municipal bylaws, and AHJ requirements. Specific ABC sections applicable to the wash bay occupancy, plumbing, and ventilation: **TBD** pending code review by the Design-Builder's code consultant. The Design-Builder shall identify and document the specific ABC Part(s) and Section(s) governing the wash bay design as part of the design basis statement.
**ASSUMPTION:** Alberta Building Code and Town of Penhold AHJ approvals are required. **To confirm or remove ASSUMPTION status:** the Design-Builder should conduct a formal code review identifying applicable ABC sections for this occupancy type.
*Source: OSR §11.2; ASSUMPTION*
*(Strengthened per lensing items C-001 and E-001)*

### REQ-WB-11: Environmental Compliance (ASSUMPTION)
Wash bay effluent containment and disposal shall comply with applicable Alberta environmental regulations (including AEP requirements if applicable).
**ASSUMPTION:** Wash water containing oil, grease, or sediment from municipal fleet vehicles is subject to environmental management requirements under Alberta regulation. **To confirm or remove ASSUMPTION status:** the Design-Builder should consult AEP directly or engage a qualified environmental consultant to determine the specific regulatory framework applicable to municipal vehicle wash water discharge in Penhold, Alberta. Until confirmed, treat this as a binding requirement for proposal-stage design conservatism.
*Source: ASSUMPTION — inferred from OSR §12.1 containment requirement and AEP reference in decomposition glossary*
*(Strengthened per lensing item A-002; see also Guidance for rationale on ASSUMPTION tags per E-001)*

### REQ-WB-12: Wash Bay Ventilation (TBD)
The wash bay shall be provided with ventilation adequate for enclosed wash operations, including moisture extraction and air exchange to prevent condensation, corrosion, and ice formation. Specific ventilation rates and system type: **TBD** pending code review and mechanical discipline input.
**ASSUMPTION:** An enclosed wash bay generating significant moisture in a cold climate requires dedicated ventilation beyond base bay provisions. The applicable Alberta Building Code section for ventilation in this occupancy type is **location TBD**.
*Source: Datasheet — Construction (Ventilation row); Guidance — HVAC and Moisture Management; ASSUMPTION*
*(Added per lensing item A-001)*

### REQ-WB-13: Wash Bay Lighting (TBD)
The wash bay shall be provided with task-appropriate lighting for wash operations. Lighting fixtures shall be rated for wet locations. GFCI protection shall be provided for electrical circuits in the wash bay wet zone. Specific lighting levels and fixture types: **TBD**.
**ASSUMPTION:** A permanent enclosed wash bay requires task lighting beyond base bay provisions. Wet-location rating and GFCI protection are standard practice for such facilities.
*Source: Datasheet — Construction (Electrical row, "lighting; details TBD"); ASSUMPTION*
*(Added per lensing item X-001)*

### REQ-WB-14: Hot Water Supply (TBD)
The wash bay shall be provided with hot water supply suitable for vehicle washing operations. Hot water capacity and temperature: **TBD** pending equipment selection and mechanical discipline input.
**ASSUMPTION:** For a permanent wash facility in a cold climate washing municipal fleet vehicles, hot water supply is a baseline operational necessity. The Datasheet Construction table lists "Hot/cold water supply" under Mechanical/plumbing.
*Source: Datasheet — Construction (Mechanical/plumbing row); Guidance — Examples (mentions "hot water supply" as typical); ASSUMPTION*
*(Added per lensing item F-002)*

### REQ-WB-15: Fire Code Compliance (TBD)
The wash bay design shall address applicable fire code requirements, including but not limited to: fire separation from adjacent bays, sprinkler requirements for enclosed wash bay, and hazardous area classification if wash chemicals are stored in or adjacent to the bay. Specific requirements: **TBD** pending fire code review.
**ASSUMPTION:** An enclosed bay with water, chemicals, and potential hydrocarbon-contaminated effluent may trigger fire code requirements under the Alberta Building Code and/or National Fire Code.
*Source: ASSUMPTION — not addressed in accessible sources; identified as a gap*
*(Added per lensing item C-002)*

### REQ-WB-16: Warranty and Deficiency Period (TBD)
Warranty period and deficiency management requirements for wash bay equipment and containment system: **TBD**. The Design-Builder shall propose warranty terms for wash equipment, containment system, and associated mechanical/electrical components as part of the option package.
