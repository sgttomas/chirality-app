# Guidance: DEL-05-01 — Option: Built-in Wash Bay

> **Terminology note:** The canonical term for this deliverable is **"wash bay"** (lowercase). Variations such as "built-in wash bay," "vehicle wash bay," and "permanent washing facilities" appear in source documents and are used contextually, but "wash bay" is the standard short-form term across all four deliverable documents. *(Normalization per lensing item B-005)*

> **Dimension notation convention:** All vehicle and bay dimensions across deliverable documents use H (height) x W (width) x L (length) with imperial units. *(Normalization per lensing item B-003)*

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to give the Owner (Town of Penhold) a transparent, separately priced option for a built-in vehicle wash bay within the Public Services Building. The Owner has the right to elect or decline this option independently from the base building contract.

The wash bay responds to an operational need: Public Works vehicles (municipal trucks, graders, sweepers, loaders) require periodic washing, and a permanent, built-in facility within the shop bay area provides a controlled, year-round solution superior to outdoor or ad hoc washing. The option is valued enough for the Owner to request a separate price, but the cost-benefit decision (built-in vs. alternative arrangements) is reserved for the Owner's election after reviewing the DB's proposal.

## Principles

### 1. Separability Above All
The wash bay option must be completely separable from the base scope — in design, documentation, and pricing. The Owner's evaluation team uses the base price to compare proposals; embedding wash bay costs in the base price would distort that comparison. Every design decision and cost element attributable to the wash bay shall be identifiable and removable without affecting the base building.
*Source: OBJ-010; SOW-0500; Addendum 03 §1.9*

### 2. Permanent and Functional
The RFP specifies "permanent washing facilities" — not a rough-in, not a future provision, not a trailer hose connection. The concept should clearly convey a complete, operating wash bay: structural floor with containment, wash equipment anchored in place, drainage system, overhead door(s), mechanical connections, and electrical service. A concept layout showing only a bay outline without equipment is insufficient.
*Source: OSR §12.1*

### 3. Right-Sized for the Fleet
The Public Works fleet includes large vehicles — a 30' grader, tandem dump trucks, and a sweeper with a 22' raised hopper. The wash bay, positioned in place of the fourth PW bay, must be designed for the actual fleet. Undersizing the bay (width, length, height, door clearance) creates an operationally useless facility. The DB's concept layout should confirm vehicle clearances.
*Source: RFP Appendix B, pp.47–48; OSR §12.1*

### 4. Containment is Non-Negotiable
The OSR explicitly requires containment of debris and moisture. On a site with no storm sewer, uncontrolled wash water carrying sediment, grease, or road chemicals cannot be allowed to run off unmanaged. The containment concept must address: how debris is captured, how wash water is collected, and how effluent is managed (interceptor, holding, or treatment approach). The DB should anticipate AEP and municipal regulatory scrutiny of this element.
*Source: OSR §12.1; OSR §11.2; ASSUMPTION: AEP likely applicable*

### 5. Integrated but Independent
While the wash bay replaces one of the PW bays, it must integrate with the main building structure (shared walls, roof, HVAC envelope) while remaining independently priceable. The structural connection to the main building is in-scope; the incremental cost of wash-specific elements is the option price.
*Source: OSR §12.1; ASSUMPTION: structural integration with main building*

## Considerations

### Sizing Considerations
- The wash bay must accommodate the widest and longest fleet vehicles in a single-vehicle pass-through or nose-in configuration. The DB must choose a bay orientation (drive-through or single-entry) that works within the PW bay layout.
- The grader (30' L, 14' W moldboard, 23'8" minimum turning radius) is the most demanding vehicle for bay length and door width. Drive-through configuration is likely preferred for large vehicles. **ASSUMPTION:** drive-through configuration is preferred; Owner ruling TBD.
- Door width must exceed the grader moldboard width when turned (14'). Door height must accommodate vehicles at maximum height (sweeper with hopper raised to 22' is an edge case — the DB should confirm whether full-height wash of the sweeper with hopper raised is a requirement or whether washing occurs with hopper lowered).

### Drainage and Effluent Management
- No on-site storm sewer is available. The DB must propose a compliant effluent management approach. Options may include: an oil-water separator with discharge to municipal sewer (if available at site), a holding tank with periodic pump-out, a recirculating wash system, or other engineered solution.
- The siting of any interceptor or holding tank must be coordinated with site civil works (PKG-003 deliverables).
- **ASSUMPTION:** Wash water from municipal fleet vehicles will contain hydrocarbons and sediment and will require treatment or managed disposal under Alberta environmental regulation. The DB should confirm regulatory requirements with AEP or the Town's environmental advisor.

### HVAC and Moisture Management
- A wash bay in an Alberta climate generates significant moisture from vehicle washing and wet floors. The DB's HVAC concept should address heated air (to support operations in winter) and moisture/humidity extraction to prevent condensation, corrosion, and ice formation in the bay and adjacent spaces.
- This is a multi-discipline consideration: the wash bay concept layout should flag HVAC requirements as design inputs for the mechanical design team.

### Pricing Transparency
- The separable pricing sheet should be structured to allow the Owner to evaluate the wash bay option on a standalone basis. Consider including:
  - A summary line item (total wash bay option price)
  - Breakdown by major element (structure/civil, mechanical/plumbing, wash equipment, electrical, containment)
  - Assumptions and exclusions that affect the price
- This structure makes the Owner's decision-making easier and demonstrates the DB's cost transparency — which is an evaluation criterion under OBJ-010.

#### Evaluating the Wash Bay Option Price *(Added per lensing item F-004)*
The pricing sheet tells the Owner *what the option costs*; the Owner also needs a framework for evaluating *whether the price represents good value*. Considerations for the Owner's evaluation:
- **Comparison to external alternatives:** What would it cost to use a commercial vehicle wash service (if available locally) for the Public Works fleet on an ongoing basis? The built-in wash bay avoids recurring commercial wash fees and vehicle transit time.
- **Operational convenience value:** A built-in facility provides year-round, on-demand access without scheduling constraints, weather exposure during transit, or security concerns with off-site washing.
- **Avoided capital in future:** If the wash bay is not built now, retrofitting later is typically more expensive than including it in new construction.
- **ASSUMPTION:** No specific commercial wash service cost data is available from accessible sources. The Owner may wish to request this comparison from staff or the DB as part of the election decision process.

### Rationale for ASSUMPTION-Tagged Requirements *(Added per lensing item E-001)*
Several Specification requirements (notably REQ-WB-10 Code Compliance, REQ-WB-11 Environmental Compliance, REQ-WB-12 Ventilation, REQ-WB-13 Lighting, REQ-WB-14 Hot Water, REQ-WB-15 Fire Code) are tagged as **ASSUMPTION** because:
- The applicable Alberta Building Code sections for this specific wash bay occupancy type were not directly accessible during document preparation. The requirement to comply with the ABC is inferred from OSR §11.2 (which references code-compliant design generally) but does not cite specific ABC sections applicable to an enclosed wash bay. Similarly, ventilation, lighting, hot water, and fire code requirements are inferred from typical municipal vehicle wash bay practice and the conditions of the site, but the exact code sections were not confirmed from accessible sources.
- Environmental compliance with AEP is inferred from the containment requirement in OSR §12.1 and the general expectation that municipal vehicle wash water containing hydrocarbons requires managed disposal, but no specific AEP regulation was cited in the accessible source documents.
- **Path to confirmation:** The Design-Builder should (a) conduct a formal code review identifying applicable ABC sections for wash bay occupancy, ventilation, lighting, and fire safety, (b) consult AEP or a qualified environmental consultant to confirm the regulatory framework for effluent disposal, and (c) document all findings in the design basis statement. Once confirmed, the ASSUMPTION tags can be removed and replaced with specific code/regulation citations. Until confirmed, these requirements should be treated conservatively as binding for design purposes.

### Interaction with Base Building
- The fourth PW bay, as a base-scope element, may include a sump for snow melt and minor washing (Addendum 03 §1.8 applies to all bays). If the wash bay is not elected, the fourth bay reverts to a standard shop bay with standard sump. If the wash bay is elected, the wash-specific elements (enhanced drain, containment, wash equipment, etc.) are the incremental option scope.
- The concept layout should identify which elements are base-scope (bay structure, overhead door, sump) versus which are wash-bay-option scope (wash equipment, containment upgrades, plumbing, drainage system, etc.). This clarity reduces change-order risk post-election.

#### Base-Scope vs. Option-Scope Boundary Examples *(Clarified per lensing item X-005)*
The following illustrative boundary classification is provided as guidance for the DB's concept layout. The definitive boundary shall be confirmed by the DB in the proposal and accepted by the Owner at option election (Procedure Step 8).

| Element | Likely Classification | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Bay structural shell (walls, roof, slab) | Base scope | The fourth PW bay exists regardless of wash bay election |
| Standard overhead door(s) | Base scope | All PW bays have overhead doors; standard door is base |
| Basic sump (snow melt/minor wash) | Base scope | Addendum 03 §1.8 requires sumps in all bays |
| Enhanced containment slab/drainage | Option scope | Beyond standard bay slab; specific to wash operations |
| Wash equipment (pressure washer, boom, etc.) | Option scope | Specific to wash function; OSR §12.1 |
| Oil-water separator / interceptor | Option scope | Specific to wash effluent management |
| Dedicated hot water supply for wash | Option scope | Beyond standard bay mechanical provisions |
| Dedicated ventilation/moisture extraction | Option scope | Beyond standard bay HVAC |
| Wash-specific lighting upgrades | Option scope (TBD) | Standard bay lighting may be adequate; task lighting upgrades are option scope |
| GFCI protection for wet zone circuits | Option scope (TBD) | May be required by code regardless; incremental cost is option scope |

**ASSUMPTION:** This classification is illustrative. The DB shall propose the definitive boundary, and the Owner shall confirm at option election. Ambiguous items should be flagged in the pricing sheet assumptions.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Drive-Through vs. Single-Entry Bay Configuration
- **Tension:** A drive-through configuration (in one door, out another) allows large vehicles to pull straight through without reversing, which is operationally efficient and avoids tight turning in the bay. However, it requires two overhead doors and a longer bay, increasing cost.
- **Single-entry** (nose-in, back-out) reduces door cost and bay length but is operationally harder for large vehicles and may not accommodate the grader's turning radius.
- **Resolution:** TBD by DB — the concept layout should state the chosen configuration and justify it relative to fleet dimensions.
- **Proposed authority:** Design-Builder to propose; Owner to confirm.

### Trade-off 2: Built-in Wash Equipment vs. Minimal Wash Infrastructure
- **Tension:** A fully equipped wash bay (hot pressure washer, recirculating system, underbody wash, etc.) delivers maximum utility but carries higher capital cost. A minimal approach (overhead drop hose, floor drain, basic containment) costs less but may not meet the "permanent facilities" intent of OSR §12.1.
- **Resolution:** The OSR language ("permanent washing facilities including equipment") implies genuine wash equipment, not merely plumbing rough-in. The DB should propose a functional system. TBD on equipment specification.
- **Source: OSR §12.1**

### Trade-off 3: Recirculating Water System vs. Once-Through with Disposal
- **Tension:** A recirculating wash water system reduces water consumption and simplifies effluent management (less volume to treat/dispose), but adds capital cost (filtration, treatment unit, recirculation pumps). A once-through system is simpler to install but generates more effluent requiring managed disposal.
- **Resolution:** TBD by DB — the choice should be driven by regulatory requirements and lifecycle cost. The DB should document the chosen approach in the containment concept.

#### Lifecycle Cost Considerations *(Added per lensing item C-003)*
When evaluating recirculating vs. once-through systems (or hybrid approaches), the following lifecycle cost factors should be considered:
- **Operating costs:** Water consumption (municipal water rates), energy for heating water, energy for recirculation/filtration pumps, sewer discharge fees (if applicable).
- **Maintenance costs:** Filter replacement frequency, separator/interceptor cleaning, pump maintenance, treatment chemical consumables.
- **Disposal costs:** Periodic pump-out of holding tanks (if once-through with holding), sludge disposal from interceptors, regulatory sampling/monitoring.
- **Capital cost difference:** Higher upfront cost for recirculating systems vs. lower ongoing operating costs.
- **ASSUMPTION:** Specific cost data is not available from accessible sources; the DB should develop lifecycle cost estimates based on selected equipment and local utility/disposal rates. This information supports the Owner's election decision.

## Examples

*No worked examples available from accessible sources. The following is an ASSUMPTION of typical approach for a municipal vehicle wash bay of this type.*

**ASSUMPTION — Typical Municipal Vehicle Wash Bay Elements (for orientation only; not a requirement):**
- Bay dimensions: typically 14'–16'W × 60'–80'L × 16'–18' clear height for drive-through large vehicle bay
- Wash equipment: overhead boom with pressure washer, hot water supply, underbody wash option
- Floor: reinforced concrete with 2%–3% slope to central trench drain; epoxy or sealed surface
- Containment: pre-cast concrete trench drains to oil-water separator (e.g., CSA B481 / API separator), then to holding tank or treatment
- Overhead doors: insulated, motorized; 16'H minimum per RFP standard
- Heating: radiant floor heat or unit heater to maintain above-zero wash operations in winter

*This example represents a plausible design approach. The DB is responsible for confirming all dimensions, equipment, and regulatory compliance. This is an ASSUMPTION only.*

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-WB-01 | Bay configuration: Drive-through vs. single-entry for wash bay is not specified in sources; fleet vehicle sizes (particularly grader 30'L, 23'8" min turning radius) suggest drive-through is operationally preferable, but cost implications differ significantly | RFP App.B pp.47–48 (vehicle dimensions) | OSR §12.1 (silent on configuration) | Specification REQ-WB-05; Guidance Trade-off 1; Procedure Step 4 | Design-Builder to propose; Owner to confirm | TBD |
| CONF-WB-02 | Sweeper hopper height: Sweeper raises to 22' with hopper raised — it is unclear whether washing with hopper raised is a required capability (which would require a very tall bay/door) or whether washing occurs with hopper lowered | RFP App.B p.48 (22' raised height) | OSR §12.1 (silent on hopper-raised wash) | Specification REQ-WB-05, REQ-WB-06; Datasheet (vehicle height) | Owner to clarify operational expectation | TBD |
| CONF-WB-03 | Effluent disposal path is unresolved: no storm sewer on site; whether municipal sewer tie-in for wash effluent is available/permitted is not confirmed in accessible sources | OSR §11.2 (no storm sewer) | Addendum 03 §1.6 (water/wastewater stubbed at site corner) | Specification REQ-WB-08, REQ-WB-11; Guidance (drainage considerations) | Owner/DB to confirm with AEP and Town; DB to propose approach in containment concept | TBD |
