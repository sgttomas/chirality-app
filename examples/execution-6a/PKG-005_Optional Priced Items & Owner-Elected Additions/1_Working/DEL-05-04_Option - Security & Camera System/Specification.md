## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable covers the optional security and camera system for the Penhold Public Services Building (PSB) main structure. The scope includes:

1. A camera layout showing interior and exterior camera placement on the main building.
2. A device schedule listing all security and camera system components.
3. A separable pricing structure that distinguishes installation costs from ongoing monitoring costs.
4. Coordination with the main building electrical system (OSR §10.4) and IT/telecommunications infrastructure (OSR §10.6) as needed.

Source: OSR §12.4; SOW-0503; _CONTEXT.md.

### Out of Scope
- Ancillary buildings (cold storage building) — not included per OSR §12.4 scope ("main structure") and per the pattern established in OSR §12.3 ("Ancillary buildings not to be included in access control"). **Note:** This exclusion is currently stated as Out of Scope narrative only and is not a numbered requirement. TBD whether to formalize as a numbered exclusion requirement (see Guidance.md Conflict Table OI-003 for human ruling). [Lensing: E-001]
- Access control system — covered separately under DEL-05-03 (SOW-0502, OSR §12.3).
- Base-scope code-required security or life-safety systems — these are included in the main building base scope, not this optional item.
- Any monitoring service contracts — this deliverable prices monitoring costs separately but does not execute a monitoring service agreement; that is an Owner decision post-award.

## Requirements

### REQ-001 — Main Building Coverage (Interior)
The security and camera system shall include camera coverage of selected interior zones within the main building. The camera layout shall demonstrate adequate coverage of each selected zone, with no unmonitored blind spots at entry/exit points within covered zones. The Design-Builder shall indicate camera field-of-view (FOV) on the layout drawing to demonstrate coverage adequacy. [Lensing: X-001, D-001]

- Source: OSR §12.4 ("cameras in parts of the interior of the main building").
- Note: Specific interior zones are not enumerated in OSR §12.4. The Design-Builder shall propose zones appropriate for a combined Fire Hall / Public Works Operations facility. **ASSUMPTION:** Key interior zones would typically include apparatus bay areas, main entrance/reception, shared corridor areas, and high-value equipment storage. Zone selection subject to Owner direction.
- **Adequacy criteria (Lensing X-001):** At proposal stage, the Design-Builder should provide a justification for the proposed number of cameras and zone coverage (e.g., "4 interior cameras covering 6 zones with overlapping FOV provide adequate coverage given the 8,000 sq ft interior area" [EXAMPLE — values TBD by Design-Builder]). At detailed design stage (post-award), the layout and camera specifications will be verified to confirm no blind spots at identified entry/exit points.

### REQ-002 — Main Building Coverage (Exterior)
The security and camera system shall include camera coverage of the exterior of the main building. The camera layout shall demonstrate adequate exterior coverage with no unmonitored blind spots at building entry/exit points (overhead doors, pedestrian entrances). The Design-Builder shall indicate camera field-of-view (FOV) on the layout drawing to demonstrate coverage adequacy. [Lensing: X-001, D-001]

- Source: OSR §12.4 ("cameras... on the exterior").
- Note: Specific exterior locations (e.g., building perimeter, overhead door approaches, parking areas) are not enumerated. The Design-Builder shall propose exterior camera placement appropriate for site security. **ASSUMPTION:** Exterior cameras would typically cover all vehicle access points, overhead door approaches, main pedestrian entrances, and perimeter areas.
- **Adequacy criteria (Lensing X-001):** At proposal stage, the Design-Builder should provide a justification for the proposed number of exterior cameras and their placement (e.g., "6 exterior cameras cover all 4 overhead doors, 2 pedestrian entrances, and parking approach with overlapping FOV" [EXAMPLE — values TBD by Design-Builder]). At detailed design stage (post-award), the layout and camera specifications will be verified to confirm no blind spots at identified building entry/exit points.

### REQ-003 — Installation Cost Separation
The pricing submission shall separately itemize the one-time installation cost for the security and camera system.

- Source: OSR §12.4 ("To include installation costs and monitoring costs separately").
- This is a mandatory pricing format requirement for this optional item.

### REQ-004 — Monitoring Cost Separation
The pricing submission shall separately itemize the ongoing monitoring cost for the security and camera system. The monitoring cost shall be expressed as both a monthly rate and an annual rate to enable consistent comparison across proposals. Additionally, the Design-Builder shall clearly state the monitoring model being priced (e.g., professional third-party monitoring, local recording only, or hybrid approach) and the cost structure implications of that model. [Lensing: A-002, B-003]

- Source: OSR §12.4 ("To include installation costs and monitoring costs separately").
- Note: The monitoring cost is to be priced and presented so the Owner can evaluate the total cost of ownership, including the cumulative cost impact over 5, 10, and 25-year periods. The monitoring service itself is Owner-elected and not contracted through this RFP. The prior advisory phrasing ("e.g., annual or monthly") has been strengthened to require both formats. Additionally, the Design-Builder should clarify the monitoring model and cost structure to enable the Owner to understand the operational budget implications of different models. [Lensing: A-002, B-003]

### REQ-005 — Camera Layout Deliverable
The Design-Builder shall produce a camera layout (drawing or plan) showing the proposed location of each camera device on the main building, indicating interior zones and exterior positions.

- Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts: "Camera layout"); Decomposition DEL-05-04.

### REQ-006 — Device Schedule
The Design-Builder shall produce a device schedule listing all security and camera system components, including device type, quantity, location reference, and key specifications.

- Source: _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts: "Device schedule"); Decomposition DEL-05-04.

### REQ-007 — Electrical Coordination
The security and camera system shall be coordinated with the main building electrical distribution and IT/telecommunications infrastructure. Low-voltage cabling and power supply for cameras shall be included in the installation scope.

- Source: OSR §10.4 (Electrical System); OSR §10.6 (IT and Telecommunications Services); ASSUMPTION.
- Note: Specific power requirements (PoE vs. dedicated power) are TBD pending system design.

### REQ-008 — Code Compliance
All security and camera system installation work shall comply with applicable Alberta codes and standards for low-voltage electrical and security system installation. [Lensing: A-001, F-001]

**Mandatory coding language (Strengthened per Lensing F-001):** The Design-Builder shall, at the proposal stage, identify and confirm the specific governing codes and standards applicable to this low-voltage security installation. At minimum, the following are presumed to apply based on Alberta construction practice:
- Alberta Building Code (ABC) — relevant sections on electrical and low-voltage system installation
- CSA C22.1 (Canadian Electrical Code) — Part I, Section 12 (Low-Voltage Wiring) or applicable sections
- CSA Z45001 or equivalent — occupational health and safety during installation

**TBD-Question (Lensing A-001):** The specific sections of these codes governing low-voltage security camera installation in public facilities have not been verified against the full text. **Human / Owner legal counsel to confirm applicability and provide or reference standard text before Design-Build contract execution.**

- Source: ASSUMPTION — Alberta Building Code (ABC) and applicable CSA standards are presumed to govern based on Alberta practice; full text not accessed (location TBD).
- Note: If the Owner's legal counsel or the municipality identifies additional standards (e.g., local bylaws, privacy regulations), those shall take precedence and shall be incorporated into the design.

### REQ-009 — Cybersecurity (Network-Connected System)
The IP-based security and camera system shall include basic cybersecurity provisions appropriate for a network-connected surveillance system in a public safety facility. At minimum, the Design-Builder shall address: (a) network segmentation (dedicated security VLAN), (b) change of all default manufacturer credentials before handover, (c) a firmware update policy or recommendation for the NVR and camera devices. [Lensing: F-002]

- Source: **ASSUMPTION** — no explicit cybersecurity requirement is stated in OSR §12.4, but IP-based networked cameras on a public facility network represent a cybersecurity consideration. Guidance C-01 and C-04 assume IP-based networked cameras, and Procedure Step B-2 references VLAN configuration. This requirement formalizes what is implied by the technology choice.
- Note: TBD — confirm whether the Owner or project cybersecurity policy imposes additional requirements beyond the minimum stated here.
