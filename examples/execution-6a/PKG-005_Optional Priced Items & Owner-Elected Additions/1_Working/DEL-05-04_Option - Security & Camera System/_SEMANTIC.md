# Deliverable: DEL-05-04 Option — Security & Camera System

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable must carry the knowledge required to present a transparently priced, separable optional security and camera surveillance system for a public services building, enabling an Owner election decision grounded in coverage adequacy, cost structure clarity (installation versus ongoing monitoring), and integration readiness with the building's electrical and IT infrastructure. The semantic lens conditions all categories, types, behaviors, and values toward the problem of optional-scope surveillance pricing and technical definition.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
