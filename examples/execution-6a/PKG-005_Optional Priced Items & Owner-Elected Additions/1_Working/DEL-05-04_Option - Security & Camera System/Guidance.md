# Guidance — DEL-05-04: Option — Security & Camera System

_Generated by 4_DOCUMENTS agent — Pass 1+2 — 2026-02-17_

---

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to give the Town of Penhold (the Owner) a transparent, separately priced option for a security and camera system covering the main Public Services Building. By pricing this item separately from the base scope, the Owner retains the decision to include or exclude the system at contract award or post-award, with full visibility into both the capital (installation) cost and the ongoing operational (monitoring) cost.

Source: OSR §12.4; SOW-0503; Decomposition OBJ-010 ("transparent, separable pricing for optional scope items").

The deliverable also serves a technical purpose: by requiring a camera layout and device schedule at the proposal stage, the Owner can evaluate the Design-Builder's understanding of the facility's security needs, the proposed system's coverage adequacy, and the reasonableness of costs — before committing to the option.

## Principles

### P-01: Cost Transparency is the Primary Driver
The defining requirement of this optional item is the separation of installation and monitoring costs. This is explicitly stated in OSR §12.4. The Design-Builder should present pricing in a way that allows the Owner to understand the full cost of ownership and to evaluate alternatives (e.g., a lower-cost installation with a third-party monitoring contract vs. a bundled solution).

**Enhanced guidance (Lensing C-003, F-003):** Cost transparency must extend beyond the proposal stage. The Design-Builder should support the Owner's ability to evaluate total cost of ownership over the building's 50-year design life by:
1. Clearly separating installation (one-time) and monitoring (recurring) costs.
2. Expressing monitoring costs in both monthly and annual terms.
3. Noting expected technology replacement cycles and estimated replacement costs, so the Owner can assess 5/10/25-year cumulative cost impact.
4. If multiple monitoring models are presented, showing the cost structure implications of each model (e.g., professional monitoring = higher annual cost but includes active response; local recording only = lower annual cost but reactive only).

### P-02: Scope is Main Building Only
OSR §12.4 specifies "main structure" — the system covers the main PSB building. Ancillary buildings (cold storage) are not included. This boundary aligns with the access control optional item (OSR §12.3), which also excludes ancillary buildings, establishing a consistent scoping pattern for optional security-related systems.

### P-03: Coverage Zones Are Design-Builder Proposed
OSR §12.4 states cameras in "parts of the interior" and on "the exterior" but does not enumerate specific zones or counts. The Design-Builder is expected to propose a coverage plan appropriate for the facility type. This gives the Design-Builder flexibility to propose a system sized for actual security risk and operational need rather than an arbitrary count.

Source: OSR §12.4.

### P-04: Integrate with Main Building IT Infrastructure
The main building is required to have IT/data compatibility throughout (OSR §10.6). The security and camera system should be designed to integrate with the building's IT network infrastructure (e.g., IP-based cameras on the building's structured cabling) rather than as an entirely isolated system. This reduces long-term maintenance complexity and supports future system expansion.

Source: OSR §10.6; ASSUMPTION (integration approach not explicitly mandated by OSR §12.4 but consistent with OSR §10.6 intent and good practice).

### P-05: Operational Context — Combined Fire Hall / Public Works Facility
The PSB is a combined Fire Hall and Public Works Operations facility with volunteer firefighters and crew members as primary users (OSR §10.3.4, §10.3.5). Security system design should account for:
- 24/7 operational readiness (fire hall never "closed")
- Multiple access points (apparatus bay overhead doors, public/staff entrances)
- Interior operational areas that may require privacy considerations (e.g., locker rooms excluded from camera coverage per standard practice)

## Considerations

### C-01: Technology Basis
OSR §12.4 does not prescribe specific camera technology. **ASSUMPTION:** IP-based (networked) cameras with network video recording (NVR) are the current industry standard for facilities of this type and would align with the building's IT infrastructure requirement (OSR §10.6). Analog systems are generally considered legacy and would require separate coaxial wiring infrastructure.

The Design-Builder should specify the proposed technology basis in the device schedule and narrative.

### C-02: Interior Zone Selection
OSR §12.4 references "parts of the interior." Recommended interior zones to consider (ASSUMPTION — Design-Builder to propose based on security assessment):
- Main entrance / reception area
- Apparatus bay areas (security context for equipment)
- Public Works shop bay areas
- Server/IT room (if applicable)
- Cash-handling or high-value storage areas (if applicable)

Excluded interior zones (ASSUMPTION — standard practice):
- Washrooms, locker rooms, showers (privacy requirements under Alberta privacy legislation)

### C-03: Exterior Coverage Strategy
Recommended exterior coverage areas (ASSUMPTION — Design-Builder to propose):
- All overhead door approaches (apparatus bays and shop bays)
- Main pedestrian entrances
- Parking areas
- Site perimeter near the building
- Vehicle fill station areas

Exterior cameras should be specified for outdoor-rated enclosures suitable for Alberta climate (extreme cold, UV exposure).

### C-04: Monitoring Model and Cost Structure
The OSR requires monitoring costs to be reported separately. The Design-Builder should clarify the monitoring model being priced and the cost structure implications of each model:

#### Monitoring Models and Cost Profiles:
- **Professional third-party alarm monitoring (ULC-listed monitoring station):** Capital cost (setup/onboarding) plus recurring monthly/annual monitoring fee. Full operational cost includes both one-time and recurring charges. [Lensing: B-003]
- **Local recording only (no active monitoring):** Capital cost for NVR/storage hardware only; minimal recurring cost (storage maintenance). Lower operating budget but reactive-only (no active emergency response).
- **Hybrid approach:** Combination of local recording with selective professional monitoring for high-priority events; moderate capital cost plus selective recurring monitoring fees.

The Owner will need this information to assess ongoing operational budget impact and to evaluate total cost of ownership (capital + 5-year/10-year/25-year operational cost accumulation). **ASSUMPTION:** Third-party professional monitoring is the expected model for a public safety facility of this type, though the OSR does not mandate a specific model.

**Design-Builder directive:** Present each feasible monitoring model option with clear cost separation (one-time vs. recurring) to enable Owner comparison. If only one model is proposed, clearly state why alternative models were not considered feasible.

### C-05: Relationship to Access Control System (DEL-05-03)
The access control system (DEL-05-03, SOW-0502, OSR §12.3) is a separate optional item covering zone-based access control within the main building. These two systems are related but distinct:
- Access control governs who can enter specific zones.
- Security/camera system provides visual surveillance and recording.

Integration between the two systems (e.g., camera triggered by access control event) is possible and may add value, but is not required by the OSR. The Design-Builder may note integration capability as a value-added feature.

Source: OSR §12.3; OSR §12.4; ASSUMPTION (integration not mandated).

### C-06: System Scalability and Future Expansion
Given the 50-year design life of the main building (OSR §10.2), the security system infrastructure (conduit, cabling pathways, NVR capacity) should be designed with expansion capability. Spare conduit capacity and NVR expansion slots are prudent but not explicitly required by OSR §12.4.

Source: OSR §10.2; ASSUMPTION.

### C-07: Total Cost of Ownership Evaluation Framework
The Owner must be able to evaluate this option not only on installation capital cost but also on the cumulative operating cost over various time horizons. **RATIONALE (Lensing C-003, F-003):** The OSR requires separation of installation and monitoring costs. This separation enables the Owner to evaluate whether the capital cost of the system is justified by the operational security benefit and to compare different monitoring models. However, the Owner also needs a framework for assessing the long-term financial impact.

**Recommended evaluation approach:**
- **Installation capital cost:** One-time expenditure.
- **Monitoring recurring cost:** Monthly or annual, clearly stated. Multiply by 5, 10, and 25 years to show cumulative impact.
- **Technology refresh costs:** Over a 50-year design life, camera and NVR technology will be replaced 2–3 times. Design-Builder should note typical hardware replacement intervals (e.g., cameras every 10 years, NVR every 5–7 years) to enable Owner long-term budgeting.
- **Deferred maintenance:** Low for IP-based systems but firmware updates and network infrastructure maintenance are ongoing.

**Design-Builder directive:** In the pricing narrative (recommended optional document per Procedure Step A-8), include a note on expected technology replacement cycle and estimated replacement costs, so the Owner can evaluate the 25-year total cost of ownership.

### C-08: System Lifecycle and Technology Refresh
Given the 50-year design life of the main building (OSR §10.2), the security system infrastructure will require technology refresh multiple times over the building's life. Current IP-based camera and NVR technology has a typical useful life of 5–10 years for core components (NVR, main switch) and 8–12 years for cameras, before obsolescence, firmware support discontinuation, or performance degradation.

**Implications for Owner planning:**
- **Years 0–5:** Initial installation and operation; firmware updates and network maintenance.
- **Years 5–10:** First major technology refresh cycle (NVR and switches); cameras may still be operational.
- **Years 10–25:** Second refresh cycle; older cameras likely replaced.
- **Years 25–50:** Potential full system replacement or migration to new technology standard.

The Design-Builder is not responsible for executing these future replacements (post-warranty), but noting the likely technology refresh intervals helps the Owner plan capital budgets.

## Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Option A | Option B | Recommended Direction | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Camera Technology | IP/networked cameras | Analog CCTV | Option A (IP) | Aligns with building IT infrastructure (OSR §10.6); lower long-term cabling cost; future expansion capability | Source: OSR §10.6; ASSUMPTION |
| Monitoring Model | Professional third-party monitoring | Local recording only | Owner decision | Professional monitoring increases annual operating cost but provides active security response; local recording is lower cost but reactive only | Source: OSR §12.4 (separation required); ASSUMPTION |
| Coverage Intensity | Comprehensive coverage (all areas) | Targeted coverage (key areas only) | Targeted (as scoped — "parts of the interior") | OSR §12.4 explicitly states "parts of the interior," suggesting targeted rather than comprehensive interior coverage; exterior coverage is more comprehensive | Source: OSR §12.4 |
| Integration with Access Control | Integrated with DEL-05-03 | Standalone | Owner decision (integration capability recommended) | Integration adds value at low marginal cost if both systems are elected; standalone is simpler if only camera system is selected | Source: OSR §12.3; OSR §12.4; ASSUMPTION |

## Examples

_No specific examples are available from accessible sources. The following are illustrative references only._

- A typical IP camera system for a combined fire hall / public works building of this scale (approximately 20,000–30,000 sq ft ASSUMPTION) might include 8–20 interior cameras and 6–12 exterior cameras, with a central NVR and remote viewing capability. These numbers are illustrative only and the Design-Builder's layout should drive the actual count. **ASSUMPTION — no source.**
