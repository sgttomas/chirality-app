## Steps

### Part A — Proposal Production Procedure

**Step A-1: Confirm Scope Boundary**
Review OSR §12.4 and confirm that the security and camera system scope is limited to the main PSB building (interior and exterior). Confirm that ancillary buildings (cold storage) are excluded. Document scope boundary in the device schedule cover page or pricing narrative.

Source: OSR §12.4.

**Step A-2: Identify Interior Camera Zones**
Using the proposed main building floor plan (conceptual at proposal stage), identify the interior areas to be covered by cameras. Confirm that privacy-sensitive areas (washrooms, locker rooms) are excluded from camera coverage per standard practice and applicable privacy legislation.

**ASSUMPTION:** Zone selection based on Design-Builder judgment in absence of Owner-specified zones; Owner to confirm or adjust during design development.

Source: OSR §12.4 ("parts of the interior"); ASSUMPTION.

**Step A-3: Identify Exterior Camera Positions**
Using the proposed site plan and building elevations, identify exterior camera positions to cover all primary access points (overhead door approaches, pedestrian entrances, parking/yard areas, perimeter near building).

Source: OSR §12.4 ("on the exterior"); ASSUMPTION.

**Step A-4: Produce Camera Layout Drawing**
Prepare a camera layout drawing or annotated floor plan/site plan showing:
- Interior camera locations (by zone) with camera field-of-view indicated.
- Exterior camera locations on a site or building elevation plan, with camera field-of-view indicated.
- Camera numbering consistent with the device schedule.

This drawing constitutes the "Camera layout" anticipated artifact per _CONTEXT.md.

**Step A-5: Produce Device Schedule**
Prepare a device schedule table listing all security and camera system devices. At minimum, include:
- Camera number (consistent with layout)
- Device type (e.g., dome, bullet, PTZ — ASSUMPTION on types)
- Location description (interior zone or exterior position)
- Key specifications (resolution, outdoor-rated Y/N, PoE Y/N)
- Quantity
- Network video recorder (NVR) or equivalent recording system

This document constitutes the "Device schedule" anticipated artifact per _CONTEXT.md.

**Step A-6: Develop Pricing — Installation Costs**
Prepare a separate pricing breakdown for the one-time installation cost of the security and camera system, including:
- Camera hardware (devices, mounting hardware)
- NVR/recording system hardware and software
- Low-voltage cabling (Cat6 or equivalent) and conduit
- Network switch(es) dedicated to security system (if applicable)
- Installation labour
- Programming and commissioning
- Any associated electrical work (conduit, power outlets)

Source: OSR §12.4 (installation costs to be separately stated); RFP Appendix H pricing format (location TBD within Appendix H).

**Step A-7: Develop Pricing — Monitoring Costs**
Prepare a separate pricing breakdown for the ongoing monitoring cost, clearly stating:
- Monitoring model being priced (e.g., professional third-party alarm monitoring, or local recording only with no active monitoring)
- Cost expressed as a per-month and/or per-year rate
- Any setup or onboarding fees associated with monitoring service

**ASSUMPTION:** If multiple monitoring models are feasible (e.g., professional monitoring vs. self-monitored), the Design-Builder may present both options with corresponding costs to assist Owner decision-making.

Source: OSR §12.4 (monitoring costs to be separately stated).

**Step A-8: Package and Submit**
Compile the following into the proposal submission:
1. Camera layout drawing/plan.
2. Device schedule.
3. Installation cost pricing (line item in Appendix H, Schedule B or optional pricing section).
4. Monitoring cost pricing (clearly labelled as separate from installation).
5. Brief narrative describing the proposed system approach, technology basis, and monitoring model (recommended — not mandatory per OSR §12.4, but supports evaluator understanding).

Submit as part of the overall RFP response per RFP §4.2 (PDF format, under 15 MB).

### Part B — Post-Award Implementation Procedure (if option is elected)

**Step B-1: Confirm Election and Design Scope**
Upon written direction from the Owner electing this option, confirm the final camera layout and device schedule with the Owner. Incorporate Owner feedback on interior zones and exterior positions. Update camera layout and device schedule accordingly.

Source: OSR §12.4; ASSUMPTION.

**Step B-2: Detailed Design — Security System**
Develop detailed design drawings and specifications for the security and camera system, including:
- Final camera layout (construction-ready)
- Low-voltage wiring/conduit plan coordinated with electrical drawings
- NVR/rack location within IT room or designated space
- Network integration design (IP addressing, VLAN, integration with building network)
- **Power requirements and UPS/backup specification (Lensing C-002):** Design shall address uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the NVR and critical cameras to ensure recording continuity during power outages. For a 24/7 public safety facility (Fire Hall), recording continuity during utility outages is a necessary operational foundation. UPS capacity (runtime and wattage) shall be sized to maintain NVR and all critical camera recording for a minimum of 4 hours (pending Owner direction). PoE switch specification shall also be included.

Coordinate with DEL-05-03 (access control) design if also elected, to identify integration opportunities.

Source: ASSUMPTION.

**Step B-5: Device Installation**
Install cameras, NVR/recording system, and all associated network equipment. Mount cameras at designed positions (interior and exterior). Complete all connections.

Source: ASSUMPTION.

**Step B-6: Programming and Commissioning**
Program the NVR with camera names, recording schedules, motion detection zones, and retention periods. Configure remote access if included. Conduct system test to confirm all cameras are operational and recording correctly. Test motion detection and alarm functions.

**Formal acceptance test criteria (Lensing X-003):** Testing shall include the following pass/fail acceptance criteria:
- **Camera image quality:** All cameras transmit clear, identifiable images (no pixelation, sufficient resolution to discern personnel/equipment).
- **Recording verification:** All cameras are actively recording at the configured frame rate and retention period; NVR storage is functional and holds test recordings.
- **NVR functional test:** Remote access via authorized network and/or local interface is operational; playback of recorded footage is clear and timestamps are correct.
- **Motion detection:** Motion detection zones are configured and generate alerts (if applicable to monitoring model).
- **UPS backup function:** If UPS is installed, verify that NVR and critical cameras continue recording for at least the designed runtime (e.g., 4 hours) in the event of power loss.

System shall be accepted only when all criteria above are satisfied. Any deficiencies noted during testing shall be remedied before handover.

Source: ASSUMPTION; Lensing item X-003 (binding foundational verdict).

**Step B-7: Owner Training**
Provide Owner staff training on:
- Accessing live camera views
- Reviewing recorded footage
- Managing the NVR (clip export, user management)
- Initiating monitoring service (if applicable)

Source: OSR §7.3.6 (Commissioning, Training, and Closeout Procedures); ASSUMPTION (applied to this optional system).

**Step B-8: Handover and Documentation**

- NVR programming documentation (camera names, recording settings, user accounts).
- Warranty documentation for all devices.
- Monitoring service activation instructions (if applicable).

Source: OSR §7.5; ASSUMPTION.

**Step B-9: Post-Installation Performance Review (Lensing X-004)**
Conduct post-occupancy performance reviews at 30 days and 6 months after system handover to confirm ongoing functionality and identify any issues requiring remediation during the warranty period.

**Review scope:**
- **30-day review:** Confirm all cameras remain operational; recording system functioning normally; no alert/alarm false positives; Owner staff comfortable with system operation.
- **6-month review:** Confirm continued performance; identify any hardware issues (camera failures, NVR errors); verify firmware updates are current; assess whether recording retention period is adequate for actual usage patterns.

**Deliverable:** Brief written report summarizing findings, any remedial actions required, and recommendations for system optimization (e.g., adjusting motion detection sensitivity, adding cameras to previously identified blind spots, or extending retention period).

**Responsibility:** Design-Builder to coordinate these reviews with Owner. If significant deficiencies are identified, Design-Builder shall remedy under warranty before final system acceptance.
