## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage Scope | Main building (Public Services Building) — interior (parts) and exterior | OSR §12.4 |
| Ancillary Buildings | Excluded (cold storage building and any other ancillary structures not included). **Note:** This exclusion is stated in the Specification Out of Scope section and in this Conditions table, but is not a numbered specification requirement. See Conflict Table item OI-003 in Guidance.md for human ruling on whether to formalize. [Lensing: E-001] | OSR §12.4 (by implication from "main structure"); ASSUMPTION: explicit exclusion of ancillary buildings inferred from OSR §12.3 ("Ancillary buildings not to be included in access control") pattern |
| Pricing Structure | Two-part: (1) installation costs, (2) monitoring costs — reported separately | OSR §12.4 |
| Camera Types | TBD — IP-based CCTV assumed to be industry standard; specific technology not prescribed by OSR. **ASSUMPTION:** Minimum parameters to define at proposal stage include camera resolution (e.g., minimum megapixels), weatherproofing rating (IP rating) for exterior cameras, and form factor (dome, bullet, PTZ). [Lensing: B-001] | ASSUMPTION |
| Minimum Camera Resolution | TBD — not specified in OSR §12.4; Design-Builder to propose minimum resolution suitable for identification-grade surveillance. [Lensing: B-001] | TBD |
| Exterior Camera Weatherproofing | TBD — exterior cameras require outdoor-rated enclosures suitable for Alberta climate (extreme cold, UV exposure); minimum IP rating to be proposed by Design-Builder. [Lensing: B-001] | TBD; ASSUMPTION |
| Number of Cameras | TBD — not specified in OSR §12.4; to be determined by Design-Builder based on layout | TBD |
| Interior Coverage Zones | TBD — OSR states "parts of the interior"; specific zones not enumerated | OSR §12.4 (partial) |
| Exterior Coverage Zones | TBD — OSR references exterior coverage; specific locations not enumerated | OSR §12.4 (partial) |
| Recording/Storage | TBD — not specified in accessible sources. The following sub-parameters require definition: (a) recording retention period (days), (b) minimum NVR storage capacity (TB), (c) recording resolution and frame rate, (d) continuous vs. motion-triggered recording mode. Design-Builder to propose values appropriate for a public safety facility. [Lensing: A-004] | TBD |
| NVR Minimum Channel Capacity | TBD — NVR channel count must accommodate the proposed camera count plus expansion capacity; Design-Builder to specify. [Lensing: B-001] | TBD |
| Monitoring Approach | TBD — third-party monitoring vs. local recording not specified; cost to be separately stated | OSR §12.4 (cost separation required) |
| Network Integration | TBD — relationship to main building IT/data infrastructure not specified in OSR §12.4. The following sub-parameters require definition: (a) VLAN requirement (dedicated security VLAN vs. shared network), (b) PoE switch capacity (number of ports, total PoE wattage budget), (c) bandwidth requirements for camera streams (per-camera and aggregate). Coordination with DEL-02-06 (Electrical/IT) required. [Lensing: B-002] | TBD; see also OSR §10.6 for main building IT infrastructure context |
| Conduit and Cabling | TBD — whether conduit pathways, cable types (Cat6 or equivalent), and PoE switch specifications are included in this optional scope or are provided as part of base-scope IT infrastructure (DEL-02-06) must be clarified. Procedure Step A-6 assumes low-voltage cabling and conduit are within this installation scope. [Lensing: X-002] | TBD; ASSUMPTION |
| Power Supply | TBD — to be coordinated with electrical distribution (OSR §10.4). PoE (Power over Ethernet) is the **ASSUMPTION** for camera power delivery; dedicated power circuits may be required for NVR and PoE switches. [Lensing: X-002] | ASSUMPTION; OSR §10.4 |

## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Optional Status | This system is NOT included in the base price; it is Owner-elected | OSR §12.4; SOW-0503; Decomposition PKG-005 |
| Pricing Separation | Installation costs and monitoring costs must be presented as distinct line items | OSR §12.4 |
| Building Context | The main PSB building is a combined Fire Hall and Public Works Operations facility with 24/7 operational readiness expectations | OSR §10.2; Decomposition Phase 1 |
| Design Life — Main Building | 50-year design life for main building (main building context) | OSR §10.2 |
| Existing IT Infrastructure | Main building to have IT/data compatibility throughout (OSR §10.6); security system must coordinate with this infrastructure | OSR §10.6; ASSUMPTION |
| Access Control Relationship | A separate optional access control system (DEL-05-03, SOW-0502) covers zone-based access; security/camera system is a distinct optional item | OSR §12.3; OSR §12.4; SOW-0502; SOW-0503 |

## Construction

| Artifact | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Camera Layout | Drawing or plan showing camera placement — interior (selected zones) and exterior of main building | _CONTEXT.md; Decomposition DEL-05-04 |
| Device Schedule | List of all security and camera devices, quantities, types, and specifications | _CONTEXT.md; Decomposition DEL-05-04 |
| Install vs. Monitoring Cost Separation | Pricing document distinguishing one-time installation cost from ongoing monitoring cost | OSR §12.4; _CONTEXT.md |

## Terminology

**Preferred term:** "network video recorder (NVR)" — use "NVR" after first use in each document. Avoid alternate forms such as "recording system," "network video recording," or "Recording/Storage" in normative or operative contexts. The Attributes table above retains "Recording/Storage" as a descriptive attribute label only. [Lensing: E-002]

### Normalization Applied (Pass 3 Lensing E-002)

**Terminology consistency across all four documents:**

The following preferred and alternate terms have been established to reduce interpretation risk across Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure:

| Preferred Term | Acceptable Alternates | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Network video recorder (NVR) | Recording system, recording equipment (in descriptive contexts only) | Network video recording, recording/storage (except in attribute labels) |
| Camera layout | Proposed layout, design layout | -- |
| Device schedule | Equipment list (informal only) | -- |
| Monitoring costs | Ongoing costs, recurring costs | -- |
| Installation costs | One-time costs, capital costs | -- |

Use the preferred term consistently in all normative and operative sections (Requirements, Steps, Verification). The Attributes table in Datasheet retains descriptive labels as originally shown.
