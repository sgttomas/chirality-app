# Guidance: DEL-05-02 — Option: Yard Lighting (Per Light)

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to give the Town of Penhold a **transparent, separable pricing tool** for yard lighting in the Public Works yard. Because the Owner's decision to add yard lighting depends on budget availability after evaluating the base proposal, the OSR structures it as an optional priced item charged on a per-light basis.

The design team's task is not simply to quote a price — it is to present a **credible, well-grounded concept** that demonstrates an understanding of the yard geometry, operational environment, and appropriate fixture technology, so the Owner can make an informed election decision.

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); OBJ-010 (Decomposition — transparent, separable pricing for optional scope items)

## Principles

### 1. Unit Rate Must Be All-In
The per-light unit rate must be genuinely comprehensive — fixture, pole, foundation, conduit, wiring, connection, and commissioning. An artificially low unit rate that excludes installation cost components will create Owner distrust and pricing disputes. The OSR explicitly requires "per light with install."

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44)

### 2. LED Is the Established Standard for This Project
The OSR establishes LEDs as the project-wide lighting standard for energy efficiency. The yard lighting concept should not propose alternatives (e.g., HID/HPS fixtures) without a clear justification. Consistent technology across indoor and outdoor applications also simplifies spare lamp management for the Owner.

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42)

### 3. Fixture Placement Must Respect Equipment Operations
The Public Works yard accommodates heavy equipment — graders, loaders, and dump trucks. Fixture poles placed in equipment travel paths, or at heights that create conflict with equipment raises or booms, create an operational hazard. Pole placement and height selection are design decisions that directly affect safety.

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: equipment clearance requirement applies to yard context.

### 4. The Concept Should Enable Owner Decision-Making
The yard lighting concept is not a full design — it is a proposal-level document to show the Owner what they are buying. A good concept includes: approximate fixture count, nominal pole height, fixture family description, coverage area rationale, and a clear unit rate. This enables the Owner to elect a specific quantity confidently.

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44)

### 5. Separability Is Non-Negotiable
The yard lighting option must be priced and documented completely independently of the base proposal. Bundling or cross-referencing base scope costs in the unit rate creates complications if the Owner does not elect the option or elects a different quantity than assumed.

## Considerations

### Site Context: 100 m Fence Line
The OSR notes the fence line is approximately 100 m from the nearest proposed structure. This establishes the outer boundary of the lighting zone, but the **exact yard footprint, number of poles required, and pole spacing** are not prescribed. The Design-Builder must make reasonable layout assumptions in the concept and state them clearly.

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); SOW-0501 (Decomposition)

### Weatherproofing for Alberta Climate
Exterior electrical installations in central Alberta must be rated for cold-climate operation, wind, and snow loading on fixtures. Fixture IP ratings, pole wall thickness, and base-plate/embedment design all matter for long-term reliability.

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42); OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44) — ASSUMPTION applied to yard context.

### Electrical Service Coordination
Yard lighting will require electrical supply from the building or a dedicated yard panel. The routing of underground conduit across a ~100 m span from the nearest structure to the fence line is a meaningful cost driver. This infrastructure cost should be included in the per-light unit rate (allocated proportionally) or addressed transparently in the pricing assumptions.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — conduit routing requirement inferred from OSR §10.4, §12.2, and site geometry. Specific routing TBD.

### IES Outdoor Lighting Standards
IES recommendations for outdoor industrial/municipal yard applications typically address maintained illuminance levels (footcandles or lux), uniformity ratios, and glare control. The Design-Builder should confirm the applicable IES publication and criteria category for outdoor yard lighting during design development.

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — specific IES publication and criteria category TBD.

### Number of Fixtures
The OSR does not specify the number of lights required. The concept should include a **fixture count assumption** (e.g., "based on X-m pole spacing across a Y m × Z m yard area, we estimate N fixtures") so the Owner understands what the unit rate covers. This assumption must be clearly labeled as the DB's basis.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — fixture count basis is a Design-Builder design decision not prescribed by OSR.

### Lifecycle Cost Considerations
The Owner's decision to elect the yard lighting option benefits from understanding not only the initial per-light unit rate but also the **total cost of ownership** over the expected service life. This enrichment addresses the Owner value-determination requirement (F-003) by bridging pre-election cost to post-election operational benefit.

**Key lifecycle cost factors:**
- **LED lamp life:** Typical LED area light fixtures are rated for 50,000-100,000 hours; at typical dusk-to-dawn operation (~12 hours/day average), this yields 11-23 years before lamp replacement is expected
- **Maintenance frequency:** LED fixtures generally require less maintenance than HID/HPS alternatives (e.g., high-intensity discharge or sodium vapor); periodic cleaning and inspection are the primary maintenance activities
- **Replacement cost:** When replacement is eventually required, fixture module replacement cost should be estimated as part of lifecycle analysis
- **Energy cost:** LED technology offers lower operating energy cost compared to alternatives; this ongoing savings supports the value proposition and reduces total cost of ownership

**Design-Builder guidance:** Include a brief lifecycle cost summary in the yard lighting concept document to support the Owner's informed election decision. This aligns with Principle 4 (enabling Owner decision-making) and addresses the rationale gap noted in F-003.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — lifecycle cost factors are standard considerations for outdoor LED lighting (F-003 enrichment); specific values TBD pending fixture selection.

### Post-Installation Value Confirmation
The Guidance documents focus primarily on pre-election decision support. However, the Owner may also benefit from understanding how the realized value of the yard lighting option can be confirmed after installation. This enrichment addresses the merit realization and value determination requirement (D-002, E-002).

**Approaches may include:**
- **Illuminance measurement:** Post-commissioning illuminance measurements at representative yard locations to confirm IES compliance and adequate coverage (included in Procedure Step B4/B5)
- **Operational feedback period:** A defined period (e.g., 30-60 days after commissioning) during which the Owner can assess whether the lighting meets operational needs in actual equipment operations (included in Procedure Step B5)
- **Performance reporting:** Documentation of measured illuminance levels against IES targets as part of the commissioning record for Owner review
- **Warranty alignment:** Clarification that yard lighting optional items carry the same 12-month warranty as base scope work (to be confirmed by contract/legal review per E-002)

This consideration bridges the gap between the pre-election value proposition and post-installation merit realization, ensuring the Owner can verify that the elected option delivered anticipated benefit.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION — post-installation value confirmation is inferred from standard commissioning practice (D-002); warranty scope for optional items to be confirmed per E-002.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Comprehensive vs. Minimal Concept
**Tension:** A more detailed concept (with AutoCAD layout, photometric analysis, etc.) is more informative but significantly more costly to produce at proposal stage.

**Resolution:** A narrative concept with a simple sketch or diagram is appropriate for proposal stage. The OSR does not require a full photometric design at this stage — only a basis sufficient for the Owner to make an informed election.

**Rationale:** Proposal resources are limited; the concept needs to be credible, not engineered.

### Trade-off 2: Per-Light Rate vs. Lump Sum
**Tension:** A lump-sum price for a complete system would be simpler to manage, but the OSR explicitly requires per-light pricing.

**Resolution:** Per-light pricing is mandatory per OSR §12.2. The unit rate approach gives the Owner flexibility to elect a reduced quantity if budget is constrained.

**Rationale:** The Owner's flexibility to elect any number of lights is a deliberate OSR design choice.

### Trade-off 3: Including Service Infrastructure in Unit Rate vs. as a Separate Line
**Tension:** The underground conduit run from the building to the yard is a fixed cost regardless of how many lights are elected. Including it fully in the per-light rate inflates the per-light cost when few lights are elected; excluding it creates a budget surprise.

**Resolution:** ASSUMPTION — the most defensible approach is to include a proportional share of service infrastructure in the unit rate and note the assumption clearly (e.g., "unit rate assumes a minimum of N lights elected; pricing not valid for fewer than N lights"). This is a design team decision to resolve.

**Rationale:** Pricing transparency and Owner trust require that assumptions be explicit. TBD — confirm approach with pricing team. **Enrichment note (A-004):** The minimum quantity assumption for unit rate validity remains unresolved. Practical execution of unit rate preparation cannot proceed without this input. The pricing team must confirm: (a) the assumed minimum number of lights for unit rate validity, and (b) whether the unit rate includes a proportional share of fixed infrastructure cost or presents it separately. This is a blocking input for Step A5 in Procedure.md.

## Examples

No worked examples are available from accessible sources at proposal stage. The Design-Builder should reference:
- Comparable municipal yard lighting installations in Alberta for fixture and pole family selection
- IES RP-8 (Roadway Lighting) or applicable IES outdoor area lighting publication for criteria (publication TBD)

_Examples: TBD pending design team input and comparable project references._
