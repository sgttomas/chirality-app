## Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing basis | Per light, including installation | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44) |
| Application area | Public Works yard (exterior yard lighting) | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44) |
| Fence line distance | Approximately 100 m from nearest proposed structure (canonical value) | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); SOW-0501 (Decomposition) |
| Lamp technology | Energy-efficient LEDs | OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: applies to yard fixtures as well as building lighting |
| Lighting standard | IES recommendations | OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: applies to yard fixtures as part of overall lighting philosophy |
| Fixture mounting | Pole-mounted (inferred from "yard lighting" and fence-line context) | ASSUMPTION |
| Switch weatherproofing | Weatherproof covers required at person doors for ancillary buildings | OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: applicable control locations TBD for yard |
| Fixture height | To avoid interference with machinery/operations | OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: applicable to yard context |
| Quantity | TBD — Owner-elected; number of lights not specified in OSR | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44) |
| Pole specification | TBD — pole type, height range, and material not prescribed in OSR; resolution required from electrical discipline lead before fixture layout and unit rate can be finalized | TBD — **decision required** (electrical discipline lead) |
| Electrical service routing | TBD — conduit/trench routing from building/service point to yard fixtures | TBD |
| Minimum IP rating | TBD — exterior fixtures require minimum IP rating (e.g., IP65 or IP66) for weatherproof compliance; to be confirmed by electrical discipline (F-001) | TBD — see Specification REQ-06 verification threshold |
| Control strategy | TBD — photocell, timer, manual, or combination not specified; resolution required from electrical discipline or Owner direction before commissioning approach can be finalized | TBD — **decision required** (see Specification REQ-10; Guidance Electrical Service Coordination) |

## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Environment | Exterior; exposed to Alberta weather (wind, snow, frost) | ASSUMPTION based on site location; OSR §11.3 (materials for weather) |
| Operational context | Public Works yard; heavy equipment operations; potential interference with lighting if fixtures improperly placed | OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) |
| Optional status | This item is NOT included in the base proposal price; it is a separately priced Owner-elected addition | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); SOW-0501; OBJ-010 |
| Separation from base | Must be clearly separated from base scope pricing | Decomposition OBJ-010 |
| Site geometry | Fence line approximately 100 m from nearest structure; yard area dimensions (length x width) TBD pending site plan from DEL-03-01 (Civil/Site); fixture count estimation requires yard geometry | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44) — **Decision required:** obtain actual yard dimensions from DEL-03-01 site plan (B-002) |

## Construction

| Element | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Fixture type | LED yard/area light on pole | ASSUMPTION based on OSR §10.5 and yard context |
| Pole foundation | Concrete direct-burial or base-plate foundation | ASSUMPTION — type TBD |
| Electrical supply | Underground conduit from building distribution or dedicated yard panel | ASSUMPTION — routing TBD |
| Installation scope | Per-light unit pricing to include: fixture, pole, foundation, conduit, wiring, connection, and commissioning | ASSUMPTION based on "per light with install" (OSR §12.2) |
| Code compliance | Electrical installation to meet Alberta Electrical Code (AEC) and applicable standards | ASSUMPTION: likely applicable (location TBD) |
| Quantity basis | Unit rate applies per light; Owner elects quantity | OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44) |
