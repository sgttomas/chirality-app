# Procedure: DEL-05-02 — Option: Yard Lighting (Per Light)

## Purpose

This procedure describes the steps to **produce** the yard lighting optional scope package (concept, pole/fixture basis, and unit rate sheet) for inclusion in the Design-Builder's proposal response to RFP 2024_004. It also includes post-award steps for **implementing** the option if elected by the Owner.

## Prerequisites

### Information Required Before Starting
- Access to OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44) — yard lighting definition
- Access to OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — LED/IES lighting standard
- Preliminary site plan showing Public Works yard extent, fence line location, and nearest proposed structure (to confirm ~100 m fence-line dimension)
- Electrical discipline input on available service points and underground distribution approach
- Pricing input from estimating team for fixture, pole, foundation, conduit, and installation labour unit costs

### Upstream Dependencies
- Declared upstream dependencies: None recorded in `_DEPENDENCIES.md` **Enrichment note (E-001):** The following items are informational dependencies, not formal declared dependencies:
  - Site plan (DEL-03-01 — Civil/Site) — needed to establish yard geometry for fixture layout planning
  - Base electrical design (DEL-02-06 — Electrical Power, Lighting, IT-Telecom & PA) — needed to confirm available service point location and capacity for yard panel/feeder
- These dependencies should be treated as **informational prerequisites** (not blocking) but must be confirmed before finalizing fixture layout and unit rate in Step A5.

### Reference Documents
- RFP 2024_004 with OSR (Appendix A), specifically §12.2 and §10.5
- Decomposition FINAL v1.0 Phase 7 — SOW-0501, OBJ-010
- _CONTEXT.md — anticipated artifacts list
- IES outdoor area lighting publication (TBD — applicable publication to be confirmed by electrical discipline)
- Alberta Electrical Code (AEC) — ASSUMPTION: applicable

## Steps

### Phase A — Proposal Development (pre-award)

**Step A1: Establish Yard Geometry**
- Obtain or develop a preliminary site plan showing the Public Works yard extent and fence line
- Confirm the fence-line distance from the nearest proposed structure (OSR states approximately 100 m, measured to fence line)
- Identify the yard boundary, likely equipment travel paths, and any areas where pole placement would be restricted (e.g., loading areas, overhead door clearance zones)

_Source: OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); OSR §10.5 (equipment clearance)_

**Step A2: Develop Fixture and Pole Basis**
- Select a LED area/yard light fixture family appropriate for outdoor heavy-equipment environments
- Confirm fixture IP rating and cold-climate suitability for central Alberta operations
- Select nominal pole height based on:
  - Equipment clearance requirements (avoid interference with raised equipment)
  - Intended illuminance coverage per pole
  - Aesthetic compatibility with PSB site
- Document fixture model/family and pole height as the "pole/fixture basis"

_Source: OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42); ASSUMPTION: IES outdoor lighting criteria applicable_

**Step A3: Develop Layout Concept**
- Develop a concept-level fixture layout for the Public Works yard:
  - Estimate nominal pole spacing to achieve IES-compliant illuminance across the yard area
  - Identify approximate pole locations relative to fence line, yard boundary, and equipment access points
  - Estimate total fixture count based on layout
- Prepare a simple sketch or narrative description of the layout concept
- Note all assumptions clearly (yard dimensions assumed, pole spacing assumed, IES criteria target assumed)

_Source: OSR §12.2; OSR §10.5; ASSUMPTION: IES outdoor area criteria TBD_

**Step A4: Develop Underground Service Routing Concept**
- **Prerequisite check (F-002):** Confirm electrical service point capacity (ampacity, available panel space) and feasibility of yard panel or feeder routing before developing detailed layout. This is a go/no-go check.
- Identify the likely service point (building panel or dedicated yard panel location)
- Estimate underground conduit route from service point to yard lighting circuit(s)
- Confirm whether conduit routing is fully allocated into per-light unit rate or treated as a separate mobilization cost (see Guidance Trade-off 3; resolve with pricing team)

_Source: ASSUMPTION — routing TBD; OSR §10.4 (electrical system flexibility)_

**Step A5: Prepare Unit Rate Sheet**
- Develop per-light unit cost including:
  - LED fixture (supply and installation)
  - Pole (supply and installation)
  - Pole foundation (concrete direct-burial or base plate — state which)
  - Underground conduit and wiring allocation per pole (or separate line — see Step A4)
  - Weatherproof fittings and junction boxes
  - Connection to circuit and commissioning
- Review for completeness: the unit rate must include all installation costs per OSR §12.2
- Format as a clear table with scope inclusions noted; state any minimum quantity assumptions
- Confirm unit rate excludes all base scope costs (clean separation)

_Source: OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); OBJ-010 (Decomposition)_

**Step A6: Assemble and Review Optional Scope Package**
- Compile:
  1. Yard lighting concept (Step A3 output)
  2. Pole/fixture basis (Step A2 output)
  3. Unit rate sheet (Step A5 output)
- Review against REQ-01 through REQ-09 in Specification.md
- Confirm pricing is clearly labeled as an optional item separate from the base proposal
- Submit as part of the proposal package under PKG-005 optional items

### Phase B — Post-Award Implementation (if Owner elects option)

**Step B0: Permitting and AHJ Coordination**
- Submit yard lighting design drawings to local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) for permit review if required by Town of Penhold bylaws or ABC requirements for pole installations
- Confirm AEC compliance and obtain electrical permit (or confirmation that no separate permit is required)
- Coordinate any site-specific conditions (e.g., utility locates, property boundary confirmations)
- Document AHJ approvals and permit numbers in design file

_Source: ASSUMPTION: exterior electrical pole installations typically require AHJ review (C-003)_

**Step B1: Confirm Owner Election**
- Upon award and during design development, confirm with the Owner:
  - Whether they wish to elect the yard lighting option
  - The quantity of lights to be installed (Owner selects number)
  - Any Owner preferences on fixture appearance or pole color/finish

_Source: OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); OBJ-010_

**Step B2: Develop Detailed Design**
- Develop engineered yard lighting design based on confirmed Owner election:
  - Finalize fixture layout with photometric analysis to confirm IES-compliant illuminance
  - Finalize pole heights and foundation design (structural calculations if required by AHJ)
  - Finalize underground conduit routing and circuit design
  - Prepare construction drawings (electrical plan, detail sheets, schedule)
  - Seal drawings with Alberta-registered electrical engineer as required

_Source: OSR §10.5; ASSUMPTION: AEC and AHJ approval requirements apply_

**Step B3: Procure Materials and Execute**
- Procure fixtures, poles, foundations, conduit, and fittings per approved design
- Install per Alberta Electrical Code and approved drawings:
  - Excavate and install underground conduit
  - Install pole foundations (cure concrete as required)
  - Erect poles and mount fixtures
  - Pull wiring, make connections, install weatherproof fittings
  - Confirm circuit protection and switching

_Source: ASSUMPTION; AEC requirements_

**Step B4: Commission and Test**
- Energize system and verify all fixtures operate correctly
- Measure illuminance levels at representative yard locations to confirm IES compliance
- Test switching/control system (photocell, timer, or manual — as designed)
- Verify light trespass to neighboring properties is within acceptable limits (IES cutoff classification criteria)
- Correct any deficiencies

_Source: OSR §10.5; ASSUMPTION: commissioning requirements consistent with base scope electrical commissioning_

**Step B5: Handover and Post-Installation Value Confirmation**
- Provide as-built drawings for yard lighting system
- Include yard lighting in O&M manual (lamp replacement, circuit information, control schedule)
- Include in deficiency review and warranty period (12-month warranty consistent with base scope — confirm scope per Specification REQ-08 and E-002)
- **Post-installation value confirmation (D-002):** Provide commissioning test record including measured illuminance levels at yard locations; during initial 30-60 day operational feedback period, solicit Owner assessment of whether lighting meets operational needs

_Source: OSR §7.3.6; §7.6 (Warranty); SOW-0013–0016 (commissioning and warranty scope); ASSUMPTION: post-installation value confirmation (D-002)_
