# Specification: DEL-05-02 — Option: Yard Lighting (Per Light)

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable covers the Design-Builder's proposal for an **optional, separately priced** yard lighting system for the Public Works yard at the Penhold Public Services Building (PSB) site. It encompasses:

- A yard lighting concept describing fixture type, pole basis, layout approach, and coverage intent for the Public Works yard
- A pole/fixture basis statement defining the proposed equipment
- A unit rate sheet providing the per-light price inclusive of all installation labour, materials, and ancillary work

The pricing basis is **per light including installation**. The Owner elects the quantity and activates this option at their discretion.

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); SOW-0501 (Decomposition); _CONTEXT.md

### Out of Scope
- Base scope electrical or lighting work inside the main building or cold storage building
- Yard lighting for the Fire Department yard or any area other than the Public Works yard (unless explicitly amended by Owner)
- Design or pricing of the electrical service tie-in or distribution panel upgrades required to serve yard lights (these are either part of base scope or a separate cash allowance per SOW-0110 — ASSUMPTION: coordination boundary TBD). **Enrichment note (X-001):** This boundary statement conflicts with Guidance.md §Electrical Service Coordination, which states infrastructure cost "should be included in the per-light unit rate." See Conflict Table CONF-03 in Guidance.md for human ruling.
- Ongoing monitoring, maintenance contracts, or lamp replacement costs beyond installation
- Scope items marked OUT in the decomposition (e.g., pickled sand storage, SOW-0400)

## Requirements

### REQ-01: Per-Light Pricing
The Design-Builder shall provide a unit rate for yard lighting on a **per-light basis inclusive of installation**. The unit rate shall include: fixture, pole, foundation (e.g., concrete embedment or base plate), underground conduit, wiring, connections, weatherproof fittings, and commissioning of each fixture.

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44)

### REQ-02: Application Area
Yard lighting shall be designed for the **Public Works yard**. The fence line is approximately 100 m from the nearest proposed structure, establishing the outer boundary of the lighting coverage zone.

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); SOW-0501 (Decomposition)

### REQ-03: LED Technology
Fixtures shall use **energy-efficient LED** technology consistent with the overall lighting philosophy for the project.

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: OSR §10.5 applies to yard lighting as a site-level standard; the OSR does not explicitly restrict §10.5 to interior/building lighting only. **Enrichment note (A-001):** Whether OSR §10.5 LED/IES standards are prescriptive for yard lighting or only assumed applicable requires confirmation -- see Conflict Table CONF-01 in Guidance.md. If confirmed, remove ASSUMPTION tag; if denied, revise to reference alternative standard or mark requirement as TBD.

### REQ-04: IES Lighting Levels
Lighting levels shall be consistent with **IES (Illuminating Engineering Society) recommendations** for the applicable yard/outdoor operational context. The specific IES publication applicable to outdoor municipal yard lighting (e.g., IES RP-8 or other) is TBD and must be identified by the electrical discipline.

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: same OSR lighting standard applies to yard fixtures. **Enrichment note (A-001, B-004):** Same prescriptive applicability question as REQ-03 (see Conflict Table CONF-01). Additionally, the specific IES publication must be confirmed (B-004) -- Guidance.md §IES Outdoor Lighting Standards notes IES RP-8 as a candidate but does not confirm.

### REQ-05: Fixture Height and Placement
Fixture heights and pole placements shall be selected to **avoid interference with heavy equipment operations** in the Public Works yard (e.g., graders, loaders, dump trucks traversing the yard).

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42) — ASSUMPTION: "fixture heights will be adjusted to avoid interference with machinery" applies to yard context.

### REQ-06: Weatherproof Construction
All exterior electrical components (switches, junction boxes, connections) shall be weatherproof and suitable for exposure to the Alberta climate (wind, snow, frost, temperature cycling). Exterior fixtures shall meet a minimum IP rating of TBD (e.g., IP65 or IP66 recommended for exposed outdoor installations -- **decision required** from electrical discipline).

**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP p.42); OSR §11.3 (RFP p.44) — ASSUMPTION: weatherproof switches noted for ancillary buildings extend to yard installations. **Enrichment note (F-001):** The current requirement states "weatherproof" without a measurable acceptance threshold. A specific minimum IP rating is needed so that the verification check (REQ-06 row in Verification table) has a pass/fail criterion to verify against.

### REQ-07: Separable Pricing
The yard lighting option pricing shall be **clearly separated** from the base proposal price. The unit rate sheet must be presented as a standalone optional item, enabling the Owner to elect any quantity of lights without amending the base contract price.

**Source:** OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44); OBJ-010 (Decomposition)

### REQ-08: Code Compliance
All electrical work shall comply with the **Alberta Electrical Code (AEC), edition TBD** (e.g., AEC 2024 edition or as adopted by Authority Having Jurisdiction) and all other applicable provincial and municipal regulations.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: likely applicable (Alberta Electrical Code referenced as governing standard for electrical work in Alberta; specific clause location TBD in RFP). **Enrichment note (C-001):** The AEC edition/year must be specified to establish a mandatory compliance threshold -- a reference to "AEC" without edition is insufficient for normative compliance determination. Confirm with AHJ or project legal requirements. **Enrichment note (C-002):** Municipal bylaws (Town of Penhold) may apply to exterior pole installations and land-use regulations; confirm applicability or document non-applicability -- see Standards table addition below.

### REQ-10: Lighting Control System
The per-light scope shall include provision for a lighting control system (photocell, timer, manual switch, or combination -- **TBD**). The control strategy shall be defined and included in the unit rate or explicitly excluded with rationale.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: inferred from REQ-01 scope (commissioning requires a switching mechanism); Datasheet Attributes (control strategy TBD). **Enrichment note (X-002):** REQ-01 includes "commissioning of each fixture" but does not address the switching/control mechanism. Complete implementation coverage requires specifying whether the control system is within the per-light scope.

### REQ-11: Light Trespass and Glare Control
Fixture selection and layout shall consider **light trespass** to neighboring properties and **glare control** for equipment operators within the yard. Design shall address IES criteria for outdoor installations regarding cutoff classification and shielding.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION: inferred from IES outdoor lighting standards (typically address light trespass and glare for outdoor installations). **Enrichment note (X-003):** No document previously addressed light trespass or glare control; this is a standard consideration in IES outdoor lighting that could trigger oversight issues if omitted. Specific IES criteria TBD pending publication identification (see REQ-04, B-004).

### REQ-09: Concept Documentation
The Design-Builder shall provide a **yard lighting concept** describing the layout approach, fixture count assumptions, coverage area, and pole/fixture basis to support Owner decision-making on whether to elect this option.

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); OSR §12.2 (RFP p.44)
