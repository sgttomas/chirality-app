# Procedure: DEL-05-06 — Option: Appliances & Laundry

## Purpose

This procedure describes two things:

1. **Production** — the steps the Design-Builder follows to produce the DEL-05-06 option package as part of the proposal submission.
2. **Implementation** — the phases the Design-Builder follows to execute the appliance and laundry scope if/when the Owner elects the option.

---

## Prerequisites

### For Production (Proposal Phase)
- Review of OSR §12.6 (RFP Appendix A, page 45) confirming the minimum appliance list
- Review of Functional Program §16.0 (RFP Appendix B, page 46) confirming kitchen area context
- Understanding of OBJ-010: transparent, separable pricing for optional items
- Access to current appliance supplier pricing (residential-grade)
- Confirmed base building design intent for kitchen and laundry rough-in locations (even at concept level)

### For Implementation (If Option Elected)
- Owner's written election of this option (prior to or at contract execution)
- Base building mechanical and electrical rough-in design confirmed for kitchen and laundry areas
- Appliance lead times identified and procurement schedule integrated with construction schedule
- Confirmation of final appliance make/model selections (Owner may want to substitute basis-of-design)

---

## Steps

### Part A — Producing the Option Package (Proposal Deliverable)

**Step A1 — Confirm Minimum Appliance List**
Review OSR §12.6 and the Functional Program to establish the minimum compliant appliance list. Confirm quantities:
- 2 refrigerators with freezers
- 2 microwaves
- 1 stove/oven with range hood
- 1 dishwasher
- 2 residential laundry sets (washer + dryer each)

Source: OSR §12.6; Functional Program §16.0

**Step A2 — Identify Basis-of-Design Appliances**
Select representative residential-grade appliances for each category. Document make, model, key specifications (size, electrical requirements, plumbing requirements), and supplier/distributor source. Note: these are basis-of-design only; Owner may substitute equivalent or upgraded models at election.

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard optional scope practice)

**Step A3 — Obtain Pricing**
Obtain current market pricing for each basis-of-design appliance. Include:
- Supply cost per unit
- Delivery to site cost (if applicable)
- Installation labour estimate (connection to rough-in, levelling, testing)
- Any allowance for Owner selection of equivalent substitutes

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard pricing practice)

**Step A4 — Identify Installation Coordination Requirements**
Document rough-in requirements for each appliance category:
- Kitchen: plumbing (dishwasher drain/supply), electrical circuits (refrigerators, microwave, dishwasher, range), ventilation (range hood exhaust duct sizing and termination)
- Laundry: plumbing (washer drain/supply per set), electrical circuits (washer and dryer per set — confirm 240V for dryer), ventilation (dryer exhaust duct per set)
Confirm which rough-ins are included in base scope and which (if any) are part of the option.

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard DB design coordination requirement); REQ-05-06-004

**Step A5 — Assemble Option Package Document**
Compile the three required artifacts:
1. Appliance list (Step A2 output — category, make/model, qty, unit price, total)
2. Pricing sheet (Step A3 output — itemized and lump-sum option total, separated from base price)
3. Installation coordination notes (Step A4 output)

Verify that the total option price is clearly labelled as a separate optional item, not included in base price.

Source: _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifacts); REQ-05-06-002; REQ-05-06-007

**Step A5a — Confirm Code Compliance** *(Enrichment: D-001, Semantic Lensing -- VerificationGap)*
The Design-Builder shall confirm that all proposed appliances comply with applicable codes and standards (CEC, NPC, NBC/ABC, CSA) per the Specification Standards table. Submit written confirmation of code compliance as part of the option package, identifying:
- CSA/cUL/equivalent certification for each appliance (per REQ-05-06-011)
- Applicable code editions used for electrical, plumbing, and ventilation design
- Any code-driven constraints on installation (e.g., clearances, dedicated circuits, exhaust requirements)

If specific code editions cannot be confirmed at proposal stage, note them as **TBD -- to be confirmed during design development** and identify the responsible party.

Source: Specification.md Standards section; REQ-05-06-011; ASSUMPTION

**Step A5b — Confirm Base Scope vs. Option Scope Boundary** *(Enrichment: C-003, Semantic Lensing -- MissingSlot)*
Document the boundary between base scope rough-in (PKG-002/PKG-003) and option scope (DEL-05-06) by creating or updating a coordination register entry that maps:
- Which rough-in elements (plumbing stubs, electrical circuits, ventilation duct stubs) are included in base building scope regardless of option election
- Which elements (if any) are only provided if the option is elected
- Interface points where base scope and option scope meet (e.g., circuit panel capacity reserved for appliance circuits)

This coordination checkpoint shall be included in or appended to the Installation Coordination Notes (REQ-05-06-004).

Source: Guidance P3; REQ-05-06-004; ASSUMPTION (standard scope coordination practice)

**Step A6 — Review Against Requirements**
Before submission, verify the package against:
- REQ-05-06-001: all minimum appliance categories and quantities present
- REQ-05-06-002: pricing is fully separate from base scope
- REQ-05-06-003: appliance list is complete with make/model/qty/price
- REQ-05-06-004: installation coordination notes cover mechanical, electrical, and ventilation, with measurable detail per Verification table
- REQ-05-06-007: option is structured so it can be elected or declined independently
- REQ-05-06-008: election mechanism and deadline are specified or noted as TBD
- REQ-05-06-009: warranty terms are specified or noted as TBD
- REQ-05-06-010: performance/quality criteria are included in appliance list
- REQ-05-06-011: CSA/cUL/equivalent certification confirmed for each appliance
- Standards compliance: written confirmation submitted or design-development deferral noted

### Part B — Executing the Option (If Owner Elects)

**Step B1 — Confirm Election and Final Selections**
Upon Owner election, confirm:
- Whether Owner accepts basis-of-design appliances or requests substitutions
- Owner's formal written approval of the final proposed appliance selections before procurement *(Enrichment: X-004, Semantic Lensing -- VerificationGap: Owner review/approval gate ensures appliances are not procured on unapproved choices)*
- Owner's preferred delivery/installation timing relative to project substantial performance
- Any Owner-specific requirements for appliance warranties or extended service agreements

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard Design-Build Owner coordination); REQ-05-06-008

**Step B2 — Procurement**
Issue purchase orders for confirmed appliances. Account for lead times (typically 2–12 weeks for residential appliances; verify at time of procurement). Schedule delivery to align with building readiness for installation.

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard procurement practice)

**Step B3 — Verify Base Building Rough-Ins**
Prior to appliance delivery, confirm with the base building mechanical and electrical trades that all rough-ins are complete and correct:
- Kitchen: dishwasher rough-in, refrigerator circuits, range hood duct stub-out, range circuit
- Laundry: washer supply/drain per set, dryer 240V circuit per set, dryer exhaust duct stub-out per set

Source: REQ-05-06-004; ASSUMPTION

**Step B4 — Install Appliances**
Install all appliances per manufacturer instructions and applicable Alberta Safety Codes. Confirm:
- Level installation
- Proper connection to rough-in (water, drain, gas if applicable, electrical)
- Operational test of each appliance
- If any construction activities remain after appliance installation, apply protective coverings (cardboard, plastic wrap) to all installed appliances and restrict access to appliance areas to prevent damage *(Enrichment: X-003, Semantic Lensing -- MissingSlot)*

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard installation practice)

**Step B5 — Commission and Hand Over**
Perform basic commissioning of each appliance:
- Run one full dishwasher cycle
- Confirm refrigerators reach operating temperature
- Test stove/oven elements/burners and range hood
- Run one washer and dryer cycle per laundry set
Document commissioning results.

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard commissioning practice)

**Step B6 — Provide Owner Training and Warranty Documentation**
Provide Owner with:
- Appliance operation and maintenance manuals
- Manufacturer warranty cards (registered in Owner's name where applicable)
- Contact information for warranty service

Source: ASSUMPTION (standard closeout requirement for Owner-operated equipment)
