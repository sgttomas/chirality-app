# Specification: DEL-05-06 — Option: Appliances & Laundry

## Scope

### In Scope
This deliverable specifies the optional priced package for supply and installation of kitchen appliances and residential laundry sets for the Penhold Public Services Building (PSB). It covers:

- Supply of all appliances meeting or exceeding the minimum list per OSR §12.6
- Installation coordination notes for integration with building mechanical rough-ins
- Transparent, itemized pricing for the appliance option, separated from base contract scope
- An appliance list with proposed make/model basis and quantities
- Allowances or pricing for Owner election

### Out of Scope
- Base contract kitchen or laundry rough-in (plumbing, electrical, ventilation connections) — these are part of the base building scope under PKG-002/PKG-003 disciplines
- Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment (FF&E) cash allowance (covered under DEL-05-07)
- Commercial-grade or institutional catering appliances unless specifically proposed by the DB as an upgrade option
- Appliances for spaces other than the kitchen area and laundry area as identified in the Functional Program

### REQ-05-06-009 — Minimum Appliance Warranty
**Source:** ASSUMPTION (standard requirement for Owner-procured equipment in a public facility); **Enrichment:** C-002 (Semantic Lensing — MissingSlot)
**Requirement:** All appliances supplied under this option shall carry a minimum manufacturer warranty of **TBD** years from the date of commissioning. The Design-Builder shall provide warranty documentation per Procedure Step B6.

### REQ-05-06-010 — Appliance Performance and Quality Criteria
**Source:** ASSUMPTION (standard practice for evaluable option proposals); **Enrichment:** A-004, E-002 (Semantic Lensing — MissingSlot, WeakStatement)
**Requirement:** The Design-Builder shall propose appliances that meet the following minimum performance criteria:
- Energy rating: **TBD** (e.g., ENERGY STAR certified where applicable)
- Minimum warranty duration: per REQ-05-06-009
- Appliance capacity thresholds: **TBD** (e.g., minimum refrigerator volume, washer load capacity)
- Expected appliance lifespan: **TBD** (to support Owner lifecycle cost assessment)

The DB shall include a quality summary in the appliance list identifying these criteria for each proposed appliance to enable holistic quality assessment by the Owner.

### REQ-05-06-011 — Appliance Certification
**Source:** ASSUMPTION (standard requirement for Canadian building appliances; CSA or equivalent certification is mandatory for electrical and gas appliances in Alberta); **Enrichment:** A-002 (Semantic Lensing — WeakStatement)
**Requirement:** All appliances supplied under this option shall bear CSA, cUL, or equivalent certification marking acceptable to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) in Alberta. The Design-Builder shall confirm certification status for each proposed appliance in the appliance list.

|---|---|---|---|
| Alberta Safety Codes Act / Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) | Electrical connections for all appliances (circuits, receptacles, grounding) | Not directly reviewed; **ASSUMPTION: likely applicable** for Alberta electrical requirements; **location TBD** | **TBD — DB to confirm applicable edition and relevant clauses during design development** |
| National Plumbing Code of Canada (NPC) | Plumbing connections for dishwasher and laundry sets (supply, drain, venting) | Not directly reviewed; **ASSUMPTION: likely applicable**; **location TBD** | **TBD — DB to confirm applicable edition and relevant clauses during design development** |
| National Building Code of Canada (NBC) / Alberta Building Code (ABC) | Range hood ventilation, dryer exhaust, and general appliance installation in occupied spaces | Not directly reviewed; **ASSUMPTION: likely applicable**; **location TBD** | **TBD — DB to confirm applicable edition and relevant clauses during design development** |
| CSA, cUL, or equivalent appliance certification | All supplied appliances shall bear certification marking per REQ-05-06-011 | Not directly reviewed; **ASSUMPTION: mandatory for Canadian residential/commercial appliances** | **TBD — DB to confirm certification for each proposed appliance at time of appliance list submission** |
