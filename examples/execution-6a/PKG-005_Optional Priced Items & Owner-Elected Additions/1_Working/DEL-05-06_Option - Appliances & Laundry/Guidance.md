# Guidance: DEL-05-06 — Option: Appliances & Laundry

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to provide the Town of Penhold (Owner) with a transparent, separately priced option for supplying and installing kitchen appliances and residential laundry sets in the Public Services Building. Because appliances represent a discrete, Owner-discretionary spend category, the RFP structures them as an optional addition rather than base scope — allowing the Owner to decide whether to procure them through this contract or through a separate process.

## Principles

### P1 — Transparency First
The core purpose of this option is transparent, separable pricing (OBJ-010). Every proposed appliance should be individually itemized so the Owner can evaluate the option on a unit-cost basis, compare it against independent procurement, and elect or decline with full information.

To facilitate this comparison, the Owner may wish to obtain independent market pricing for equivalent appliances prior to making an election decision. The DB's itemized pricing (per REQ-05-06-002 and REQ-05-06-003) should be structured to enable a like-for-like comparison -- identifying the specific make/model, quantity, and unit price so the Owner can validate the option price represents reasonable value against independent procurement alternatives. *(Enrichment: D-002, Semantic Lensing -- RationaleGap)*

**Source:** OBJ-010 (Decomposition)

### P2 — Minimum as Floor, Not Ceiling
OSR §12.6 specifies minimum quantities and types. The Design-Builder should treat these as the floor: proposals meeting exactly the minimum are compliant, but the DB may propose upgraded appliances (e.g., commercial-grade range, larger refrigerators, stacked vs. side-by-side laundry) where operationally justified, provided all upgrades are clearly identified and separately priced so the Owner can select the base-minimum option or the upgrade.

**Source:** OSR §12.6

### P3 — Integration with Base Design
Although this is an optional scope package, the base building design must accommodate the appliances regardless of whether the Owner elects the option. Kitchen rough-ins (plumbing, electrical, ventilation) should be included in base scope so the building is appliance-ready on delivery. This protects the Owner's ability to elect the option late or procure appliances independently.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (standard Design-Build practice; base mechanical/electrical rough-in is base scope); Functional Program §16.0

### P4 — Residential Grade is Acceptable
OSR §12.6 explicitly calls for "residential laundry sets," indicating the Owner's expectation is residential-grade (not commercial/institutional) for the laundry component. Similarly, the kitchen appliance language does not specify commercial-grade. The DB should default to residential-grade unless proposing an upgrade.

**Source:** OSR §12.6

## Considerations

### Kitchen Area Context
The Functional Program (Appendix B, §16.0 — Lunch Room/Kitchen) identifies this space as serving the building occupants generally. The appliance list in §16.0 corroborates OSR §12.6: 2 fridges, range, stove, range hood, 2 microwaves, sink, dishwasher. The sink is part of the base building rough-in; appliances are the optional add-on.

**Source:** Functional Program §16.0 (RFP Appendix B, page 46)

### Laundry Area Context
The laundry sets are associated with the washing facilities in the locker/change room area (Functional Program §22.0 — Unisex Locker Room Washing Facility and Washrooms). This space is used by firefighters and public works staff who require on-site laundry capability. **ASSUMPTION:** Two laundry sets implies capacity for two concurrent loads — appropriate for a dual-department facility with shift operations.

**Source:** OSR §12.6; Functional Program §22.0 (contextual); ASSUMPTION (operational rationale)

### Pricing Format Recommendation
Option pricing should present: (a) unit price per appliance category, (b) total option lump sum, and (c) any allowance for installation labour. If the DB proposes upgrade alternatives, each alternative should have its own line item with incremental cost over the base minimum.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (best practice for Owner-electable options in Design-Build proposals)

### Code Compliance Responsibility
All appliances must be CSA-certified (or equivalent) per REQ-05-06-011. Range hood exhaust must comply with Alberta Building Code ventilation requirements. Dryer exhaust must be ducted per code. The DB is responsible for confirming compliance during design development.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION (standard requirement; specific code references not directly reviewed -- see Specification.md, Standards section)

**Rationale for assumption-based Standards entries** *(Enrichment: C-001, Semantic Lensing -- RationaleGap):* The Specification Standards section lists four code/standard families (CEC, NPC, NBC/ABC, CSA) as "ASSUMPTION: likely applicable" because the underlying standard texts were not directly reviewed during document preparation. This is a deliberate design-development deferral, not an oversight. The DB is responsible for confirming the applicable code editions and specific clauses during design development and shall update the Standards section accordingly. Until the DB provides this confirmation, no clause-level requirements are derived from these standards, and all code applicability statements remain assumptions.

### Gas vs. Electric Fuel Type for Stove/Oven *(Enrichment: B-003, Semantic Lensing -- TBD_Question)*
**TBD:** OSR §12.6 does not specify whether the stove/oven should be gas or electric. This is a fundamental design decision that affects:
- Mechanical rough-in scope (gas line vs. high-amperage electrical circuit)
- Code compliance requirements (gas fitting code vs. electrical code provisions)
- Pricing (gas appliances and gas line infrastructure vs. electric)
- Ventilation requirements (gas combustion exhaust vs. electric range hood requirements)

The DB or Owner/design team should confirm the preferred fuel type early in design development. If gas is selected, the base building scope (PKG-002/PKG-003) must include gas service to the kitchen area.

**Source:** OSR §12.6 (absence of specification); ASSUMPTION (both fuel types are viable for residential-grade stove/oven)

### Delivery Logistics and Site Protection *(Enrichment: X-001, Semantic Lensing -- MissingSlot)*
Appliance delivery to a construction site requires coordination with the construction schedule:
- **Timing:** Appliances should not be delivered until interior finishing of the kitchen and laundry areas is substantially complete (flooring, cabinetry, countertops installed) to avoid damage during construction.
- **Protection during remaining construction:** If appliances are installed before substantial performance, protective covers (e.g., cardboard or plastic wrapping) and access restrictions (e.g., barricading the appliance areas or restricting trade access) should be applied to prevent damage from ongoing construction activities. The DB should confirm responsibility for this protection in Step B3 and Step B4 verification.
- **Packaging disposal:** The DB should plan for responsible disposal or recycling of appliance packaging and shipping materials, particularly for a construction site with waste management constraints. Coordinate disposal timing with the project waste management plan.

## Trade-offs

### T1 — Residential vs. Commercial Grade Appliances
- **Tension:** Commercial-grade appliances offer greater durability and throughput but are significantly more expensive and may require commercial-grade rough-in (gas line sizing, electrical ampacity, ventilation capacity).
- **Resolution:** Default to residential-grade per OSR §12.6 language. Propose commercial-grade as a separately priced upgrade only if the DB believes the operational environment warrants it.
- **Rationale:** The OSR uses the word "residential" explicitly for laundry sets, and does not specify commercial-grade for kitchen appliances, indicating Owner expectation for residential-grade throughout.
- **Lifecycle cost consideration** *(Enrichment: F-003, Semantic Lensing -- RationaleGap):* For a public facility with a multi-decade expected service life, the Owner should consider lifecycle cost when evaluating residential vs. commercial grade. Residential-grade appliances typically have shorter expected lifespans (8-12 years) and may require more frequent replacement in a high-use public facility compared to commercial-grade equivalents (15-20+ years). The DB should provide, where available, expected appliance lifespan and energy consumption data (per REQ-05-06-010) to support the Owner's total-cost-of-ownership assessment. **TBD:** Confirm whether the Owner wishes to evaluate lifecycle cost as a factor in the election decision.
- **Source:** OSR §12.6; ASSUMPTION (lifecycle cost relevance for public facility)

### T2 — Include Allowance vs. Fixed Price
- **Tension:** Appliance pricing can be provided as a fixed lump sum (specific make/model basis) or as an allowance (Owner selects final appliances within budget). A fixed price gives more certainty; an allowance gives Owner more choice.
- **Resolution:** The _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifacts reference "allowances/pricing" -- suggesting the DB may structure part of this as an allowance. **TBD (B-004, Semantic Lensing):** The preferred pricing format (fixed-price, allowance, or hybrid) is an Owner decision to be confirmed. Until the Owner confirms, the DB should default to a fixed-price basis-of-design approach (providing specific make/model with firm unit prices) while noting that an allowance structure is available as an alternative. This provides the Owner a concrete price to evaluate at election while preserving the option for flexibility.
- **Source:** _CONTEXT.md; ASSUMPTION (interpretation of "allowances/pricing" language)

### T3 — Option Election Timing
- **Tension:** If the Owner elects this option late (after design is substantially complete), changes to rough-in may be costly. If rough-in is built in speculatively, base costs increase.
- **Resolution:** Design-Builder should include appliance-ready rough-in in the base design regardless of option election, so that the option can be elected at any point before occupancy without construction impact. The installation coordination notes (REQ-05-06-004) should specify what is pre-installed in base scope.
- **Source:** ASSUMPTION (standard Design-Build risk management practice)
