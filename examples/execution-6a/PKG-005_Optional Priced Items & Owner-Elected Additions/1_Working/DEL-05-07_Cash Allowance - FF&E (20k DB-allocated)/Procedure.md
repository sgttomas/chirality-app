# Procedure: DEL-05-07 — Cash Allowance: FF&E ($20k; DB-Allocated)

## Purpose

This procedure describes two related processes:

1. **Proposal Production Process** — Steps to produce the DEL-05-07 proposal deliverable (the FF&E allowance package submitted with the RFP response).
2. **Allowance Administration Process** — Steps to administer and reconcile the FF&E cash allowance post-award during design and construction.

Both processes apply to the Design-Builder as the responsible party.

## Prerequisites

### For Proposal Production (Pre-Submission)
- Addendum 03 §1.18 (reviewed and understood — FF&E as separate additional item, not in base costs)
- DEC-005 (reviewed — $20k allowance, DB-allocated; example allocation understood)
- Decomposition SOW-0506 (reviewed — scope boundary understood)
- Internal alignment between the DB team on what constitutes FF&E vs. base construction scope
- Coordination with DEL-05-06 (Appliances & Laundry) to prevent scope overlap in the FF&E boundary definition
- Understanding of the spaces in the Penhold PSB program (Meeting/Training, Lunchroom, Reception, shared spaces) sufficient to propose a credible allocation schedule

### For Allowance Administration (Post-Award)
- Executed Design-Build contract (including allowance terms)
- Owner contact confirmed for FF&E selection approvals
- DB project accounting system capable of tracking allowance expenditures separately from base contract
- Design milestone schedule identifying when Owner FF&E input is required

## Steps

### Phase A: Proposal Production

**Step A-1 — Define FF&E Boundary**
Prepare a written FF&E boundary definition that distinguishes FF&E items (freestanding and readily relocatable furnishings and equipment) from base construction scope (permanently attached fixtures, millwork, building systems). Explicitly address semi-fixed items (e.g., wall-mounted shelving) and note any items where boundary is ambiguous. Exclude appliances if they are addressed under DEL-05-06.
- Output: Written boundary definition section (1–2 paragraphs + item classification table)
- Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact; ASSUMPTION — content per standard procurement boundary practice

**Step A-2 — Prepare $20k Allocation Schedule**
Using the DEC-005 example as a starting point, prepare a proposed allocation schedule distributing $20,000 across eligible spaces. Confirm the total equals exactly $20,000. Note that the schedule is a DB recommendation subject to rebalancing with the Owner during design.
- Output: Allocation table (minimum columns: Space/Category, Proposed Allocation, Notes)
- Source: DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506

**Step A-3 — Draft Procurement and Selection Notes**
Write notes describing how the DB will manage FF&E procurement within the allowance. Include: (a) how the DB will solicit Owner input on selections; (b) sourcing approach (open market, preferred suppliers if any); (c) timing relative to design milestones; (d) any lead-time considerations.
- Output: Procurement/selection notes section (narrative, ~0.5–1 page)
- Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact; ASSUMPTION — process content per DB standard practice

**Step A-4 — Draft Reconciliation Approach**
Describe how the DB will track, document, and reconcile actual FF&E expenditure against the $20,000 allowance. Include: (a) tracking method (e.g., separate cost code, allowance log); (b) how Owner approvals for expenditures will be recorded; (c) how unspent funds will be returned; (d) how overspend will trigger a change order process.
- Output: Reconciliation approach section (narrative, ~0.5 page)
- Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact; ASSUMPTION — process content per standard allowance administration practice

**Step A-5 — Compile Exclusions and Assumptions List**
Prepare an explicit list of: (a) items not covered by the FF&E allowance (exclusions); (b) conditions and assumptions under which the allowance applies. At minimum, address: permanently attached fixtures excluded, appliances covered separately under DEL-05-06, Owner election required for allowance to apply, $20k total is a hard cap.
- Output: Exclusions/assumptions section (bullet list or table)
- Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact; Decomposition PKG-005 description; Addendum 03 §1.18

**Step A-6 — Assemble and Format Proposal Package**
Compile the five artifacts (boundary definition, allocation schedule, procurement notes, reconciliation approach, exclusions/assumptions) into a single formatted section. Present the FF&E allowance as a clearly labeled additional item separate from the base proposal pricing.
- Output: Complete DEL-05-07 proposal section, ready for submission
- Source: Addendum 03 §1.18 (separate from base costs requirement)

**Step A-7 — Internal Review**
Review the complete package for: (a) total allocation equals $20,000; (b) FF&E allowance is not embedded in base price; (c) no scope overlap with DEL-05-06 (Appliances); (d) boundary definition is consistent with Specification REQ-05; (e) all five required artifacts are present.
- Output: Reviewed and approved proposal package

### Phase B: Allowance Administration (Post-Award)

**Step B-1 — Confirm Allowance Terms with Owner**
At project kick-off, confirm with the Owner the final FF&E boundary, any rebalancing of the allocation schedule, and the Owner's process for approving FF&E selections. Document the confirmed allocation in the project allowance log.
- Output: Confirmed allocation schedule, signed off by Owner representative
- Timing: Design kick-off meeting

**Step B-2 — Establish Allowance Tracking**
Set up a separate cost code or allowance log for FF&E expenditures. Ensure the tracking system captures: date, item description, supplier, cost, Owner approval reference, and running balance against $20,000.
- Output: FF&E allowance log (active throughout design and procurement phases)
- Source: ASSUMPTION — standard allowance administration practice

**Step B-3 — Solicit Owner Input at Design Development Milestone**
Present FF&E selection options to the Owner at the agreed design development milestone. Obtain written approval for selections before committing expenditure. Document Owner approvals.
- Output: Owner-approved FF&E selection record
- Timing: Per agreed design milestone (ASSUMPTION — to be set at project kick-off; no prescriptive timing in accessible sources)

**Step B-4 — Procure and Install FF&E**
Procure approved FF&E items within the allowance. Coordinate installation timing with construction schedule (typically near substantial completion). Confirm that all procured items fall within the agreed boundary definition.

> **Note (X-002):** If FF&E items are procured or delivered before the installation area is ready (e.g., long-lead items arriving ahead of schedule), the DB shall arrange appropriate staging and storage. Coordination requirements include: (a) identifying a secure, climate-appropriate staging area on or near site; (b) documenting receipt and condition of stored items; and (c) scheduling final installation once the space is available. Storage costs, if any, should be tracked against the allowance or flagged for separate handling per contract terms. **Source:** ASSUMPTION — standard procurement coordination practice; no prescriptive staging requirements in accessible sources. See also Guidance C-06.

- Output: FF&E delivered and installed; delivery records on file

**Step B-5 — Reconcile Allowance at Substantial Completion**
At substantial completion, prepare a final FF&E reconciliation statement showing: total allowance ($20,000), total actual expenditure, items purchased, and surplus or shortfall. Process any surplus return or change order for overspend per contract terms.
- Output: Final FF&E reconciliation statement
- Source: _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact "Reconciliation approach"

## Records

The following records shall be produced and retained:

| Record | Phase | Responsible | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEL-05-07 proposal package (5 required artifacts: FF&E boundary definition, $20k allocation schedule, procurement/selection notes, reconciliation approach, exclusions/assumptions list) | Proposal | DB | Contract close-out |
| Confirmed post-award allocation schedule (Owner sign-off) | Post-award | DB | Contract close-out |
| FF&E allowance log (running expenditure tracker) | Design / procurement | DB | Contract close-out |
| Owner FF&E selection approvals (written) | Design | DB | Contract close-out |
| Delivery and installation records | Construction | DB | Contract close-out |
| Final FF&E reconciliation statement | Closeout | DB | Contract close-out + warranty period |

### Warranty Period — FF&E Deficiency Handling (C-002)

> **Note:** The above Records table covers the proposal through closeout lifecycle. During the warranty period, responsibility for FF&E defects or deficiencies should be clarified. Specifically:
> - **Manufacturer warranty items:** FF&E items covered by manufacturer warranties should have warranty documentation transferred to the Owner at substantial completion. The DB shall compile and hand over all applicable manufacturer warranty certificates.
> - **DB obligation:** Whether the DB bears responsibility for FF&E defects beyond manufacturer warranty coverage (e.g., installation-related damage, items failing within the contract warranty period) should be confirmed per the executed Design-Build contract terms. TBD — contract warranty terms for FF&E not stated in accessible sources.
> - **Owner responsibility:** After warranty expiration, FF&E maintenance and replacement is the Owner's responsibility.
>
> **Source:** ASSUMPTION — standard allowance and warranty practice; no prescriptive post-closeout FF&E terms in accessible sources.
