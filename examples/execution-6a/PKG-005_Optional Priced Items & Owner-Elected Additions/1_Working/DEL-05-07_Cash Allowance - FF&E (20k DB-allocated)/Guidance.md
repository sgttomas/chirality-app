# Guidance: DEL-05-07 — Cash Allowance: FF&E ($20k; DB-Allocated)

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to provide transparent, separable pricing for Owner-elected FF&E additions to the Penhold Public Services Building. By carrying FF&E as a $20,000 cash allowance separate from the base proposal, the Owner (Town of Penhold) can accurately evaluate the construction cost of the building on its own merits, and then elect whether and how to apply the FF&E allowance during design development.

The allowance supports **OBJ-010: transparent, separable pricing for optional scope items**. The Decomposition's Objective-to-Deliverable mapping explicitly lists OBJ-010 as covering SOW-0500 through SOW-0506, and the Phase 7 traceability table maps SOW-0506 (FF&E allowance) to DEL-05-07 with OBJ-010 as the supporting objective. This association is confirmed at the scope-item level (SOW-0506 ↔ OBJ-010) in the decomposition. (X-001: CONFIRMED — the objective linkage is documented in the decomposition traceability matrix; however, full confirmation of OBJ-010's authoritative text would require direct review of OBJ-010's narrative statement.)

## Principles

### P-01: Separation from Base Costs
FF&E must be kept entirely separate from base construction pricing. The Owner's evaluation team needs a clean construction cost against which to assess value. Embedding FF&E in the base price would obscure this comparison.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.18 (explicit direction).

### P-02: DB Proposes, Owner Confirms
The Design-Builder proposes the allocation schedule as a recommendation, not a fixed commitment. This gives the Owner visibility into how the DB intends to use the allowance while retaining Owner control over actual selections and rebalancing.
**Source:** DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506.

### P-03: Total Allowance is a Hard Cap
The $20,000 total is fixed. The DB allocates within this cap. Any rebalancing (shifting money between spaces/categories) must remain within the $20,000 total. This is not a provisional sum — it is a defined allowance.
**Source:** DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506 (explicit: "$20k cash allowance; DB allocates").

### P-04: Boundary Clarity Protects Both Parties
A clear written FF&E boundary definition protects the DB from scope creep (Owner adding items they expect are covered) and protects the Owner from ambiguity about what they are getting for $20,000. The boundary must distinguish between FF&E (freestanding/loose furnishings and equipment) and base building scope (permanently attached fixtures, building systems).
**Source:** _CONTEXT.md anticipated artifact "FF&E boundary definition"; ASSUMPTION — boundary content derived from standard procurement practice.

### P-05: Reconciliation Enables Transparent Closeout
A defined reconciliation approach ensures that at project completion, any unspent allowance is returned to the Owner (or applied per contract terms) and any overspend triggers a formal change process. This is standard allowance management practice.
**Source:** ASSUMPTION — no prescriptive reconciliation method stated in accessible sources; standard DB allowance management practice applies.

## Considerations

### C-01: Spaces Most Likely to Benefit from FF&E
The example allocation in DEC-005 identifies the following as priority spaces: Meeting/Training Room ($8k), Lunchroom ($6k), Reception ($3k), and Miscellaneous Loose Furnishings ($3k). These are the shared/office-type spaces where loose furnishings are operationally relevant for a combined Fire Hall and Public Works facility.
**Source:** DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506.

### C-02: Apparatus Bay and Workshop Areas
Apparatus bays and Public Works workshop/shop bays are functional, operationally specialized spaces. FF&E for these areas (e.g., tool storage, workbenches) may be handled separately as operational equipment rather than interior FF&E. The DB should clarify in the boundary definition whether any FF&E applies to these areas.
**Source:** ASSUMPTION — no explicit direction in accessible sources; recommend confirmation with Owner.

### C-03: Timing of Owner Input on Selections
Because FF&E selections affect space planning (e.g., furniture dimensions, clearances), Owner input should be sought during the design development phase rather than at construction. The DB's procurement/selection notes should identify the design milestone at which Owner input is required.
**Source:** ASSUMPTION — standard design-build coordination practice; no prescriptive timing stated in accessible sources.

### C-04: Owner Election is Not Guaranteed
PKG-005 items are Owner-elected additions, not guaranteed inclusions. The FF&E allowance may or may not be activated. The DB should note this in the deliverable so the proposal is clear that the $20,000 appears only if the Owner elects to proceed.
**Source:** Decomposition PKG-005 description ("Not included in base price unless selected by Owner").

### C-05: No Town Supplier Preference
Addendum 03 §1.19 confirms the Town has no preference on suppliers for security/camera systems. While this clause addresses a different system, it indicates the Town does not generally mandate specific suppliers. The DB has discretion in FF&E sourcing within the allowance.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.19 (adjacent clause; by inference — ASSUMPTION that approach extends to FF&E sourcing).

### C-06: Lead-Time Planning for FF&E Procurement
FF&E items, particularly specialty furniture or items with long manufacturing lead times, may require procurement decisions earlier than the installation date (typically near substantial completion). The DB should identify any long-lead FF&E items during the design development phase and coordinate procurement timing with construction schedule milestones. Early identification allows the DB to: (a) secure favorable pricing and availability, (b) avoid schedule delays at substantial completion, and (c) plan staging/storage if items arrive before the installation area is ready (see Procedure Step B-4). Without lead-time planning, there is a risk that FF&E procurement becomes a critical-path constraint near project closeout. (X-003)
**Source:** ASSUMPTION — standard procurement practice for institutional FF&E; no prescriptive lead-time requirements stated in accessible sources. Procedure Step A-3 references lead-time considerations.

## Trade-offs

### T-01: Specificity of Allocation Schedule vs. Design-Phase Flexibility
- **Tension:** A more detailed allocation schedule (e.g., specifying individual furniture items) increases Owner confidence but reduces DB flexibility during design development. Conversely, a lump-sum allowance ($20k undifferentiated) is easier to administer but provides no visibility into how the DB intends to distribute value across spaces.
- **Resolution:** Propose a category-level allocation (by space/functional area, not by item) with a stated rebalancing mechanism. This provides enough structure for evaluation while preserving design-phase flexibility.
- **Rationale:** DEC-005 explicitly identifies the allocation as an "example" subject to rebalancing. A category-level schedule (by space, not by individual item) is consistent with this intent. Category-level granularity serves the Owner's evaluation and control needs because: (a) it provides enough structure for the Owner to understand how the DB intends to distribute value across functional areas (Meeting/Training, Lunchroom, Reception, etc.), enabling informed rebalancing decisions and trade-off assessments; (b) it avoids premature item-level commitment that would constrain design-phase flexibility when furniture selections are not yet finalized; (c) it directly supports OBJ-010 (transparent, separable pricing) by making the intended allocation visible; and (d) a lump-sum-level allocation would provide no visibility into distribution intent, which undermines the transparency objective. Category-level is therefore the appropriate granularity—not more detailed (which would over-commit the DB), not less detailed (which would obscure intent). (D-002)
**Source:** DEC-005; OBJ-010 (Decomposition Phase 3).

### T-02: Broad vs. Narrow FF&E Boundary Definition
- **Tension:** A broad FF&E boundary (including semi-fixed items) maximizes Owner value from the allowance but risks scope overlap with base building construction. A narrow boundary (freestanding items only) is safer for the DB but may leave the Owner with less.
- **Resolution:** Define the boundary at the level of "freestanding and readily relocatable furnishings and equipment." Flag semi-fixed items (e.g., wall-mounted shelving, built-in millwork) as base construction scope and explicitly exclude them from the allowance.
- **Rationale:** Protects the DB from scope claims while being transparent to the Owner about what $20,000 covers.

## Examples

### Example Allocation Schedule (from DEC-005)

| Space / Category | Proposed Allocation |
|---|---|
| Meeting / Training Room | $8,000 |
| Lunchroom | $6,000 |
| Reception | $3,000 |
| Miscellaneous Loose Furnishings | $3,000 |
| **Total** | **$20,000** |

**Source:** DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506.

> This is an illustrative example only. The DB shall confirm and refine this schedule with the Owner during design development. The $20,000 total is a hard cap.

### Example Boundary Distinction

| Item | Classification | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Freestanding tables and chairs | FF&E (within allowance) | Freestanding; readily relocatable |
| Built-in reception millwork / casework | Base construction | Permanently attached; part of interior construction |
| Freestanding kitchen appliances | ASSUMPTION — FF&E if Owner elects; confirm | May overlap with DEL-05-06 Appliances allowance |
| Integrated cabinetry | Base construction | Permanently attached |
| Freestanding shelving units | FF&E (within allowance) | Freestanding; readily relocatable |
| Wall-mounted shelving (bolted) | ASSUMPTION — base construction or FF&E; confirm with Owner | Semi-fixed; boundary depends on installation method |

> **Note on appliances overlap:** DEL-05-06 covers appliances and laundry as a separate optional item (SOW-0505). Care should be taken to ensure the FF&E allowance (SOW-0506) does not double-count appliances already priced under DEL-05-06. The DB should explicitly exclude appliances from the FF&E boundary if they are covered under DEL-05-06.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CON-001 | Addendum 03 §1.18 directs FF&E as "additional item" but does not set the $20k value; DEC-005 sets the $20k value based on a Gate 5 clarification. The source of the $20k figure may need confirmation if questioned by the Owner. | Addendum 03 §1.18 | DEC-005 / Decomposition SOW-0506 | REQ-01; Datasheet Attributes | Treat DEC-005 as authoritative for the $20k figure; cite both sources | TBD |
| CON-002 | Potential scope overlap between FF&E allowance (DEL-05-07 / SOW-0506) and Appliances allowance (DEL-05-06 / SOW-0505). Whether freestanding kitchen appliances are FF&E or Appliances is not clarified in accessible sources. Under an evaluative-obligation lens (E-002), the obligation to provide clear value to the Owner requires this boundary to be resolved authoritatively. The Datasheet excludes appliances by assumption, the Guidance flags the overlap, and Procedure Step A-5 mentions it, but no authoritative resolution exists. | _CONTEXT.md DEL-05-07 (FF&E boundary); Datasheet Conditions | Decomposition DEL-05-06 (Appliances & Laundry) | Boundary definition; Exclusions list; Datasheet Conditions | Exclude appliances from FF&E allowance; confirm that DEL-05-06 covers all appliances (Owner decision required) | TBD |
