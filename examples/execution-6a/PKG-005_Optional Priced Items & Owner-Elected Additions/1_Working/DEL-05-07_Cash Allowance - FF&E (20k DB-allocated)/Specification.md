# Specification: DEL-05-07 — Cash Allowance: FF&E ($20k; DB-Allocated)

## Scope

### In Scope
- Definition of the FF&E boundary (what constitutes FF&E for this allowance)
- Proposed allocation schedule distributing the $20,000 allowance across eligible spaces
- Procurement and selection notes governing how the DB manages the allowance
- Reconciliation approach for tracking expenditure against the $20,000 total
- Explicit exclusions and assumptions associated with this allowance

### Out of Scope
- FF&E costs are **not included in the base proposal price** (Addendum 03 §1.18)
- Permanently attached fixtures that form part of the building construction (included in base scope)
- Building systems (HVAC, electrical, plumbing) even where interfacing with FF&E items
- Apparatus bay equipment, cold storage building, and shop/workshop areas (ASSUMPTION — these are not shared/office spaces; confirm with Owner if any FF&E applies)
- Code-required signage (base scope per Decomposition PKG-002)

## Requirements

### REQ-01 — Allowance Value
The FF&E cash allowance shall be carried at exactly **$20,000** (CAD), not included in the base price.
**Source:** DEC-005 (establishes the $20,000 figure); Addendum 03 §1.18 (directs FF&E as an "additional item" separate from base costs, but does not itself state the dollar value); Decomposition SOW-0506.

> **Note (A-001):** The $20,000 value originates from DEC-005 (Gate 5 clarification), not from Addendum 03 §1.18 directly. Addendum 03 establishes the treatment of FF&E as a separate additional item but does not specify the allowance amount. See Guidance CON-001 for the full conflict record. Treat DEC-005 as the authoritative source for the dollar value (PROPOSAL — pending human ruling on CON-001).

### REQ-02 — Separate Pricing Presentation
The FF&E allowance shall be presented as a **separate, clearly identified line item** in the proposal, distinct from base construction costs, to enable accurate building cost evaluation by the Owner.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.18.

### REQ-03 — DB Allocation Responsibility
The Design-Builder shall propose an allocation schedule distributing the $20,000 across eligible spaces. The allocation shall cover, at minimum, the following example categories as a starting point: Meeting/Training Room, Lunchroom, Reception, and Miscellaneous Loose Furnishings.
**Source:** DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506.

### REQ-04 — Owner Rebalancing
The proposed allocation shall be presented as a DB recommendation and shall be subject to rebalancing with the Owner during the design phase. The total shall not exceed $20,000 after rebalancing.
**Source:** DEC-005; Decomposition SOW-0506.

### REQ-05 — FF&E Boundary Definition
The deliverable shall include a clear written definition of what constitutes FF&E for this allowance (e.g., freestanding and semi-fixed furnishings, non-integrated equipment), distinguishing FF&E from base building construction scope.
**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact: "FF&E boundary definition"); ASSUMPTION — boundary definition content derived from standard procurement practice; exact RFP requirements at location TBD.

### REQ-06 — Procurement and Selection Notes
The deliverable shall include notes describing how the DB intends to manage selection and procurement within the allowance: process for Owner input, supplier sourcing approach, and timing within the design/construction schedule.
**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact: "Procurement/selection notes"); ASSUMPTION — process details to be developed by DB; no prescriptive method stated in accessible sources.

### REQ-07 — Reconciliation Approach
The deliverable shall describe how the DB will track, document, and reconcile actual FF&E expenditure against the $20,000 allowance, including how surplus or shortfall will be handled.
**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact: "Reconciliation approach"); ASSUMPTION — reconciliation method to be proposed by DB; no prescriptive approach stated in accessible sources.

### REQ-08 — Exclusions and Assumptions List
The deliverable shall include an explicit list of exclusions (items not covered by the allowance) and assumptions (conditions under which the allowance applies), to support transparent cost evaluation.
**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (anticipated artifact: "Exclusions/assumptions").

## Standards

| Standard / Reference | Applicability | Accessibility |
|---|---|---|
| Addendum 03 §1.18 (Town of Penhold, July 31, 2024) | Primary direction for FF&E as additional item separate from base | Accessible |
| RFP 2024_004 (main document) | General DB obligations and pricing format | location TBD — full text not reviewed |
| Town of Penhold Procurement Policy | May govern allowance administration post-award | location TBD — not in accessible sources |

> **ASSUMPTION:** No specific furniture procurement standard (e.g., BIFMA) or interior design code is cited in accessible sources as applying to this allowance. The DB shall confirm whether any Town standards govern FF&E selection.

> **TBD (C-001):** Confirm whether any Town of Penhold procurement policy or furniture standard (e.g., BIFMA, fire-retardant rating for institutional furnishings) applies to FF&E selections under this allowance. This is unconfirmed in accessible sources and could surface post-award. **Source:** Town procurement office / Owner clarification.

> **TBD (D-001):** Review full RFP 2024_004 text for any pricing format requirements that may apply to how the FF&E allowance must be presented in the proposal. The RFP main document text has not been reviewed. **Source:** RFP 2024_004 (location TBD).

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification Approach |
|---|---|
| REQ-01 — Allowance value $20,000 | Check proposal document: FF&E line item equals exactly $20,000 |
| REQ-02 — Separate pricing presentation | Confirm FF&E appears as a distinct line, not embedded in base costs; additionally verify that the FF&E allowance is not subtotaled or aggregated with base costs in any summary or roll-up tables (A-002) |
| REQ-03 — DB allocation schedule | Confirm allocation schedule sums to $20,000 and covers required categories |
| REQ-04 — Owner rebalancing provision | Confirm narrative acknowledges rebalancing mechanism and $20k cap |
| REQ-05 — Boundary definition present | Confirm written definition distinguishes FF&E from base construction. Boundary definition must address at minimum: (a) permanently attached vs. freestanding items, (b) semi-fixed items (e.g., wall-mounted shelving), and (c) appliance overlap with DEL-05-06 (A-003, F-001, X-004). Mere presence of a definition is insufficient; the definition must be substantive enough to prevent classification disputes. |
| REQ-06 — Procurement/selection notes present | Confirm notes address process, Owner input, sourcing, and timing |
| REQ-07 — Reconciliation approach present | Confirm approach describes tracking, documentation, and surplus/shortfall handling |
| REQ-08 — Exclusions/assumptions list present | Confirm list is explicit and complete relative to known scope boundaries |
| CON-001 — $20k value source resolution | Confirm that the source-of-value conflict (CON-001: Addendum 03 vs. DEC-005) has been resolved or accepted before final submission. If CON-001 remains at TBD, flag for human ruling. (E-001) |
