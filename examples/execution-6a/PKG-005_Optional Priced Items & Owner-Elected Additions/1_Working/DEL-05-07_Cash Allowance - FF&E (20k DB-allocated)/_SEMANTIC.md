# Deliverable: DEL-05-07 Cash Allowance -- FF&E ($20k; DB-Allocated)

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to define and govern a separable cash allowance for furniture, fixtures, and equipment -- establishing boundary clarity between FF&E and base construction scope, structuring a capped allocation for Owner-elected procurement, and providing the reconciliation and exclusion framework necessary for transparent optional-item pricing within a design-build proposal.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
