## Summary

No hard blockers prevent this estimate from proceeding. However, three dependency-driven information gaps affect quantity confidence. These are classified as **MEDIUM** impact and are tracked as assumptions in the current estimate.

## Dependency-Driven Information Gaps

| # | Dependency | From | Impact on Estimate | Current Mitigation | Priority |
|---|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | DEP-03-03-E003: DEL-03-02 grading design (finished grade levels for pavement subgrade) | DEL-03-02 (PKG-003) | Finished grades determine actual surfacing area extents and affect sub-base depth requirements. Without finished grades, quantities are parametric. | Quantities derived from PP-10 assumed site area breakdown. | MEDIUM |
| 2 | DEP-03-03-E004: PKG-002 architectural drawings showing overhead door locations | PKG-002 (Main PSB) | Concrete apron dimensions depend on exact door locations and vehicle swept paths. Currently assumed at 4.88m x 8.0m per door. | ASM-007 covers assumed apron dimensions. | MEDIUM |
| 3 | DEP-03-03-E005: PKG-004 architectural drawings showing cold storage overhead door locations | PKG-004 (Cold Storage) | Cold storage apron dimensions depend on door locations. Currently assumed at 4.88m x 8.0m per door. | ASM-008 covers cold storage door count (confirmed at 2). | LOW |
| 4 | DEP-03-03-E008: DEL-03-04 underground utilities beneath pavement areas | DEL-03-04 (PKG-003) | Utility crossings beneath paved areas may require additional base reinstatement or trench backfill that affects pavement integrity. No cost impact currently estimated. | Not priced; utility reinstatement assumed to be carried in DEL-03-04 estimate. | LOW |

## Conclusion

The estimate is executable with assumed quantities. All information gaps have been documented as assumptions (ASM-001 through ASM-016) and will be resolved when upstream deliverables produce their outputs.
