# Decision Log — EST_DEL-03-03_2026-02-18_1200

Decisions made by the estimating agent during this run.

| DecisionID | Description | Rationale | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| DEC-EST-001 | Used RecommendedRate from Paving_Surfacing_Rates.csv for all line items (not RateMin or RateMax). | RATE_TABLE basis requires use of the provided rate table. Recommended rate represents the table author's best single-point estimate. RateMin/RateMax are informational. | Amounts are single-point estimates at recommended rates. |
| DEC-EST-002 | Scope boundary enforcement: subgrade preparation (stripping, grading, compaction) is NOT included in this estimate. These items belong to DEL-03-02 per cost ownership rules. | Brief explicitly states: "Earthwork/grading -> DEL-03-02 (NOT DEL-03-03)". PS-01/PS-02 notes say "includes base prep" which is interpreted as granular base layer prep, not subgrade earthwork. | Subgrade prep cost carried in DEL-03-02 estimate, not here. |
| DEC-EST-003 | Scope boundary enforcement: site layout/design cost is NOT included. Belongs to DEL-03-01. | Brief explicitly states: "Site layout design -> DEL-03-01 (NOT DEL-03-03)". | Design fees for site layout carried elsewhere. |
| DEC-EST-004 | Aggregate yard estimated at 300mm total depth (two 150mm lifts) because PS-03 rate covers 150mm per rate table description. | Specification REQ-03-03-05 assumes 300mm minimum. PS-03 unit rate description says "150mm crushed gravel; compacted." Two lifts needed to reach 300mm. | Two line items (L-003, L-004) instead of one. Total aggregate = $360,000 before geofabric. |
| DEC-EST-005 | Added geosynthetic supplemental allowance lines (L-012, L-013, L-014) even though rate table notes say "includes base prep." | The Specification (REQ-03-03-12) and Datasheet explicitly require geosynthetics per cross-section. Rate table notes are ambiguous about whether geosynthetics are fully included. Conservative approach to avoid underestimating. | Adds $62,000 in geosynthetic allowances. If already in PS-01/PS-02 rates, these lines can be removed in next iteration. |
| DEC-EST-006 | Concrete aprons for cold storage building included under DEL-03-03. | Brief explicitly states: "Concrete aprons at overhead doors (main building + cold storage) -> DEL-03-03 (NOT PKG-002, PKG-004)". OSR 10.3.10 says "all overhead door access points." | L-006 covers cold storage aprons ($10,296). |
| DEC-EST-007 | ROUNDING=DOLLAR applied. All amounts in Detail.csv are rounded to nearest dollar at the line level. WBS_CBS_Matrix totals are summed from rounded line amounts. | Per brief instruction ROUNDING=DOLLAR. | Minor rounding differences vs. raw calculation. |
| DEC-EST-008 | Civil design fees (DF-02 in Professional_Design_Fees.csv) are NOT included in this estimate. Design fees are a percentage of construction cost and belong to PKG-001 general requirements. | Cost ownership: design fees are carried at the package/project level, not at the individual deliverable construction estimate level. | No design fee line items in Detail.csv. |
