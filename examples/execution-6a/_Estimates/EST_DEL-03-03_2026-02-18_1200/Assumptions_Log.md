# Assumptions Log — EST_DEL-03-03_2026-02-18_1200

All assumptions below are used in the estimate and must be validated when design progresses. Each assumption is referenced from Detail.csv line items.

| AssumptionID | Description | Impact | Source/Basis | Referenced By |
|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| ASM-001 | All quantities are pre-design estimates based on Assumed_Project_Parameters.csv (PP-10, PP-13, PP-14, PP-19) and parametric area breakdowns. No measured site plan areas are available. | HIGH — quantities may change significantly when DEL-03-01 site plan is issued. | PP-10 states site area breakdown; no site plan exists yet. | All line items |
| ASM-002 | Paving_Surfacing_Rates.csv recommended rates are used as the basis. These are parametric rates (not firm quotes from a paving contractor). | MEDIUM — actual pricing may differ from parametric rates. | Paving_Surfacing_Rates.csv; Basis column = PARAMETRIC for all items. | All line items |
| ASM-003 | Heavy duty asphalt area (Zone A) assumed at 2,000 m2 based on PP-10 fire routes allocation of ~0.5 acres. | MEDIUM — actual fire route extents depend on site layout from DEL-03-01 and turning radius analysis. | PP-10 breakdown: access/fire routes ~0.5 ac = ~2,023 m2. Rounded to 2,000 m2. | L-001, L-012 |
| ASM-004 | Light duty asphalt area (Zone B) assumed at 3,200 m2 based on PP-10 parking allocation of ~0.8 acres and 40 stalls (PP-19). | MEDIUM — actual parking layout depends on DEL-03-01 site plan. | PP-10 breakdown: parking ~0.8 ac = ~3,237 m2. Cross-check: 40 stalls x 25 m2/stall = 1,000 m2 + ~2,200 m2 aisles. | L-002, L-013 |
| ASM-005 | Aggregate surfacing area (Zone C) assumed at 6,000 m2 based on PP-10 yard/storage allocation of ~1.5 acres. | MEDIUM — actual yard extent depends on site layout and operational requirements. | PP-10 breakdown: yard/storage ~1.5 ac = ~6,070 m2. Rounded to 6,000 m2. | L-003, L-004, L-014 |
| ASM-006 | Aggregate yard depth assumed at 300mm (two 150mm lifts) per Specification REQ-03-03-05 assumption. The Specification states this requires design confirmation. | MEDIUM — actual depth depends on pavement design report. If depth is less, L-004 may be removed. If greater, additional lift needed. | Specification REQ-03-03-05: "ASSUMPTION: minimum 300 mm compacted depth anticipated." | L-003, L-004 |
| ASM-007 | Concrete apron depth (length perpendicular to door opening) assumed at 8.0m per door, to accommodate vehicle swept path for graders and fire apparatus. | MEDIUM — actual dimension depends on vehicle swept path analysis and architectural door locations. | Standard practice for 16 ft overhead doors serving large vehicles. Door width = 4.88m (16 ft). | L-005, L-006 |
| ASM-008 | Cold storage building has 2 overhead doors (PP-14), both receiving concrete aprons per OSR 10.3.10 ("all overhead door access points"). | LOW — confirmed in decomposition and parameters. | PP-14 = 2; SOW-0302 specifies openings on two opposite sides. | L-006 |
| ASM-009 | Curb and gutter length assumed at 250 lm around parking area perimeter. | MEDIUM — depends on parking layout from DEL-03-01. | Parametric estimate for ~3,200 m2 parking area perimeter. Rectangular approximation ~57m x ~56m perimeter = ~226 lm, rounded to 250 lm. | L-007 |
| ASM-010 | Concrete sidewalk area assumed at 150 m2 for accessible routes from parking to main building entrance. | MEDIUM — depends on building entry locations and parking layout from DEL-03-01 and PKG-002 architectural. | Standard municipal facility: ~1.5m wide x ~100m total path = 150 m2. | L-008 |
| ASM-011 | Line painting quantity assumed at 450 lm covering 40 stall markings + fire lane markings. | LOW — line painting is a minor cost item; quantity will adjust with parking layout. | 40 stalls x ~5.5m per stall line = 220 lm + ~200m fire lane/accessible markings + arrows. Rounded to 450 lm. | L-009 |
| ASM-012 | 3 accessible parking stalls assumed per Alberta Building Code for a 40-stall parking lot. | LOW — standard code requirement; unlikely to change significantly. | Alberta Building Code accessible parking requirements for 40 stalls. | L-010 |
| ASM-013 | 12 bollards assumed at overhead doors and building corners for vehicle protection. | MEDIUM — count depends on architectural layout and door locations. | Standard practice at operational/emergency facilities. Typical: 1-2 per door entry + corners. | L-011 |
| ASM-014 | Geogrid supplemental allowance at $8/m2 for heavy duty asphalt Zone A. PS-01 notes "includes base prep" but may not fully include geogrid supply/install. | LOW — conservative allowance; if PS-01 fully includes geogrid, this line can be removed. | Typical biaxial geogrid supply+install = $6-$10/m2 in Alberta. Conservative midpoint. | L-012 |
| ASM-015 | Geofabric supplemental allowance at $5/m2 for light duty asphalt Zone B. PS-02 notes "includes base prep" but may not fully include geofabric supply/install. | LOW — conservative allowance; if PS-02 fully includes geofabric, this line can be removed. | Typical woven geofabric supply+install = $3-$6/m2 in Alberta. | L-013 |
| ASM-016 | Geofabric separation layer at $5/m2 for aggregate yard Zone C at subgrade interface. PS-03 does not mention geosynthetics in its notes. | MEDIUM — Specification REQ-03-03-12 requires geosynthetics where specified in cross-sections. Aggregate yard may require separation layer per geotechnical recommendation. | Typical woven geofabric supply+install = $3-$6/m2. Geotechnical report Section 8 references geofabric at subgrade. | L-014 |
