## Assumptions

| AssumptionID | Category | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong | Affected Lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Building area | Main PSB building footprint is 18,000 sf (single storey) | PP-05 in Assumed_Project_Parameters.csv; described as "Based on functional program: 4 fire bays + 4 PW bays + office/admin + support spaces; ~160x110 ft" | If footprint is larger/smaller, all area-based quantities change proportionally | L-004 through L-009 |
| ASM-002 | Building area | Bay areas are approximately 2,100 sf each (midpoint of 2,000-2,200 sf range from Datasheet), totaling 16,800 sf for 8 bays | Datasheet.md Space Program table; Addendum 03 Section 1.21 | If bays are larger, shared-space area shrinks and vice versa | L-004 through L-009 |
| ASM-003 | Area breakdown | Office/admin/shared spaces occupy approximately 5,200 sf of the 18,000 sf footprint; circulation/corridors/mechanical rooms occupy approximately 2,000 sf; balance (beyond bays) is split between programmed shared space and circulation | Derived: 18,000 sf total minus 8 bays at approximately 1,350 sf average in-plan (bays are drive-through and measured differently than the 2,100 sf functional area which includes vertical clearance context) leaves approximately 7,200 sf for non-bay areas, split 5,200 sf programmed + 2,000 sf circulation. This is a significant assumption. | High impact: partition quantities, finish areas, door counts, and design fees all scale with this area. Functional Program (Appendix B) would resolve this. | L-001 through L-010 |
| ASM-004 | Door count | 18 single interior doors and 1 double door pair in office/admin/shared areas | Derived from Datasheet.md room list: 2 executive offices + 5 regular offices + 2 washrooms + 1 kitchen/breakroom + 1 meeting/training room (double door) + 1 custodial + 1 IT room + 1 utility room + 1 PW shop office/washroom + 2 miscellaneous (storage, corridor) = 18 single + 1 double | If room count is higher (Functional Program may show additional rooms), door count and hardware cost increase. +/- 5 doors = +/- $12,000 | L-001, L-002, L-003 |
| ASM-005 | Partitions | Interior partition wall area estimated at approximately 3,500 sf of wall face (both sides) for office/admin/shared areas | Derived: approximately 30 rooms/corridors requiring demising; average 10 lf per room at 10 ft height = 300 sf per room x 2 sides, but many share walls; net estimate ~3,500 sf face area | Medium impact: partitions are a significant cost element; actual wall layout from floor plans would be needed for precision | L-004 |
| ASM-006 | Floor finish | Sealed concrete floor finish applies to approximately 5,200 sf of office/admin/shared space; bay floor finishing (if any beyond structural slab) attributed to DEL-02-02/DEL-02-03 | Cost ownership rules from brief: "interior construction (partitions, finishes, doors) -> DEL-02-01" and "fire bay functional fit-up -> DEL-02-02", "PW bay functional fit-up -> DEL-02-03" | If finish responsibility is interpreted differently, area could be 5,200 sf to 18,000 sf (3.5x range) | L-005 |
| ASM-007 | Paint | Interior wall paint area estimated at approximately 7,000 sf (wall surface in office/admin/shared areas including corridors; both sides of partitions plus exterior-facing walls of shared spaces) | Derived: ~3,500 sf partition face + ~3,500 sf perimeter/corridor walls in shared zone | Medium impact: paint is relatively low-cost per sf; +/- 2,000 sf changes cost by a modest amount | L-009 |
| ASM-008 | Configuration | Single-storey configuration assumed for this estimate; no second-storey option included | PP-05 (18,000 sf single storey) is the primary parameter used; PP-06 (20,000 sf with 2nd floor) is not used | If 2-storey configuration is selected, additional stair, elevator, floor structure, and egress costs apply; additional shared-space finish area of ~2,000 sf | All lines |
| ASM-009 | Scope boundary | Meeting room workstation infrastructure (power + data drops for 15 EM workstations) is excluded from DEL-02-01 and belongs to DEL-02-06 per cost ownership rules | Brief: "Meeting room workstation infrastructure (power + data) -> DEL-02-06 (NOT DEL-02-01)" | If the boundary shifts, DEL-02-01 would need to include IT rough-in costs | N/A (exclusion) |
