## Assumptions

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Impact | Sensitivity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | DEL-03-01 is apportioned 30% of the total civil engineering design fee (DF-02). | The total civil design fee (DF-02, 2.5% of $1,800,000 = $45,000) covers design across all 5 deliverables in PKG-003 (DEL-03-01 through DEL-03-05). DEL-03-01 (Site Plan, Circulation, Parking & Operational Layout) is the foundational design deliverable that establishes the site configuration used by all downstream PKG-003 deliverables. A 30% share reflects its role as the primary layout/coordination deliverable, weighed against the remaining 4 deliverables (DEL-03-02 grading ~25%, DEL-03-03 pavements ~20%, DEL-03-04 utilities ~15%, DEL-03-05 environmental ~10%). | L-001 Amount = $13,500. If apportionment shifts to 25% the amount would be $11,250; at 35% it would be $15,750. | MEDIUM. A +/-5% apportionment shift changes the amount by +/-$2,250. |
| ASM-002 | DEL-03-01 is apportioned approximately 42% ($5,000 of $12,000) of the total construction survey and staking cost (EC-11). | EC-11 ($12,000) covers "initial layout; progress surveys; as-built; for full site development." The initial site layout and staking (establishing building corners, access road centerlines, parking area boundaries, property line verification) is the most survey-intensive single phase. Progress surveys during construction are incremental, and the as-built survey (SOW-0113) is assigned to DEL-01-07. Allocating ~42% to initial layout reflects the proportional effort. | L-002 Amount = $5,000. If apportionment shifts to 33% the amount would be $4,000; at 50% it would be $6,000. | LOW. A +/-10% apportionment shift changes the amount by +/-$1,200. |
| ASM-003 | The site/civil construction value (PP-23 = $1,800,000 CAD) is used as the fee base for DF-02 without adjustment. | PP-23 is described as "4.5 ac developed x 43560 sf/ac x $9/sf average; very rough" with LOW confidence. No better construction cost estimate is available at this stage. The value is used as-is pending bottom-up estimates from DEL-03-02, DEL-03-03, and DEL-03-04. | Directly scales L-001 (design fee). A 20% increase in construction value ($2,160,000) would increase the total civil design fee to $54,000 and the DEL-03-01 share to $16,200. | HIGH. Design fee is linearly proportional to construction cost base. |
| ASM-004 | No additional specialist consulting fees (geotechnical review, building science, environmental) are attributed to DEL-03-01. | DF-07 (environmental consulting) and DF-08 (geotechnical review) are separate line items in Professional_Design_Fees.csv. Environmental consulting belongs to DEL-03-05 per cost ownership rules. Geotechnical review supports DEL-03-02 (grading/earthworks) primarily. DEL-03-01 consumes these outputs but does not drive the consulting cost. | No additional lines in Detail.csv for specialist consulting. If geotechnical or environmental work is required specifically for site plan decisions (e.g., contamination investigation affecting layout), this assumption should be revisited. | LOW. |
