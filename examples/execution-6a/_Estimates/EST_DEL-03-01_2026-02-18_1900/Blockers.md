# Blockers Report — EST_DEL-03-01_2026-02-18_1900

## Summary

No hard blockers prevent the current estimate for DEL-03-01. The estimate uses a percentage-of-construction-cost method for design fees and a lump-sum apportionment for survey, both of which are viable without upstream deliverable completion. However, dependency evidence identifies several upstream inputs whose unresolved maturity affects design scope certainty.

## Upstream Prerequisites (from Dependencies.csv)

| DependencyID | Source | Target | Type | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-03-01-009 | DEL-03-01 | DEL-02-01 (Architectural Program) | PREREQUISITE | Maturity TBD | LOW — building footprint dimensions affect site plan layout but do not change the design fee percentage or survey cost. Footprint is estimated at PP-05 (18,000 sf). |
| DEP-03-01-010 | DEL-03-01 | DEL-02-02 (Firehall Bays) | INTERFACE | Maturity TBD | LOW — overhead door schedule affects apron count (priced in DEL-03-03, not DEL-03-01). |
| DEP-03-01-011 | DEL-03-01 | DEL-02-03 (PW Shop Bays) | INTERFACE | Maturity TBD | LOW — building footprint dimensions (same as DEP-03-01-009 rationale). |
| DEP-03-01-012 | DEL-03-01 | DEL-04-01 (Cold Storage Config) | PREREQUISITE | Maturity TBD | LOW — cold storage footprint is confirmed at 60x100 (PP-07). Siting parameters TBD but do not change design fee. |
| DEP-03-01-014 | DEL-03-01 | TPN46 (Site Grading Drawings) | PREREQUISITE | Maturity TBD | NONE — drawings are available (RFP appendix). Full set to be provided post-award. |
| DEP-03-01-015 | DEL-03-01 | Geotechnical Report | PREREQUISITE | Maturity TBD | LOW — report available (Appendix D). Sufficiency for full developable area unconfirmed. |
| DEP-03-01-016 | DEL-03-01 | Civil survey files | CONSTRAINT | PENDING (post-award) | NONE for current estimate. Post-award design refinement requires these files. |
| DEP-03-01-017 | DEL-03-01 | Adjacent Subdivision Exhibit | PREREQUISITE | Maturity TBD | NONE — exhibit is available. Flood boundary confirmed. |

## Assessment

The current estimate methodology (design fee as percentage of construction cost, plus survey apportionment) does not depend on the maturity of these upstream inputs. The upstream prerequisites primarily affect the *design content* of DEL-03-01, not the *cost to produce it*. If the scope of DEL-03-01 were to expand significantly (e.g., requiring additional specialist studies or iterations), the apportionment percentages in ASM-001 and ASM-002 might need revision.

**Hard blockers: 0**
**Soft blockers (maturity TBD but non-blocking for current method): 6**
**Post-award constraints (expected): 1**
