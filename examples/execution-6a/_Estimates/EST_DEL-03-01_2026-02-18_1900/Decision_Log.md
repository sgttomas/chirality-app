## Decisions Made During This Run

| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-001 | Rate table sources with declared basis of MARKET or PARAMETRIC are accepted as RATE_TABLE evidence for this run. | The provided price sources (Professional_Design_Fees.csv, Earthwork_Civil_Rates.csv) declare their basis as MARKET or PARAMETRIC. However, they are structured as rate tables (ItemID, Unit, RecommendedRate) and function as rate tables. Under ALLOW_MIXED_METHODS=FALSE, all Detail.csv lines must use Method=RATE_TABLE. Treating these structured rate files as rate table evidence is the most reasonable interpretation. | Method field set to RATE_TABLE for all lines. Flagged in QA as a basis-label mismatch (not a method mismatch). |
| DEC-002 | DEL-03-01 scope is limited to DESIGN fees and SURVEY/layout costs only — no construction costs included. | The Cost Ownership Rules in the brief explicitly state that pavement construction belongs to DEL-03-03, earthworks to DEL-03-02, utilities to DEL-03-04, and environmental to DEL-03-05. Although the brief's cost drivers mention "parking lot construction" and "access road," the cost ownership table takes precedence. DEL-03-01 carries only the civil design effort for site plan, circulation, and parking layout, plus the initial survey/staking. | Total estimate reflects design + survey only ($18,500). Construction quantities and costs are excluded and will appear in DEL-03-02, DEL-03-03, DEL-03-04 estimates. |
| DEC-003 | DF-02 (civil design fee) calculated using PP-23 ($1,800,000) as construction cost base, then apportioned. | PP-23 is the only available estimate of site/civil construction value. Despite LOW confidence, it is the best available input. The total civil design fee ($45,000) is then apportioned to DEL-03-01 per ASM-001. | L-001 amount = $13,500 (30% of $45,000). Confidence set to LOW to reflect PP-23 uncertainty. |
| DEC-004 | EC-11 (survey and staking) apportioned rather than allocated in full to DEL-03-01. | EC-11 ($12,000) covers "initial layout; progress surveys; as-built; for full site development." DEL-03-01 covers the initial layout/staking phase. Progress surveys and as-built survey work belong to construction-phase deliverables (DEL-01-07 commissioning/closeout covers the as-built survey per SOW-0113). | L-002 amount = $5,000 (42% of $12,000). See ASM-002. |
| DEC-005 | ROUNDING=DOLLAR applied to all amounts. | Per brief instruction. All amounts rounded to nearest whole dollar. | Amounts in Detail.csv and WBS_CBS_Matrix.csv are whole-dollar values. |
| DEC-006 | Fallback not invoked — all lines priced from rate table sources. | FALLBACK_POLICY=STRICT. Both line items have rate table evidence (DF-02 and EC-11). No TBD amounts required. | No fallback lines in Detail.csv. |
