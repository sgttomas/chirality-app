| RiskID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Related |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-01 | Camera count changes significantly once floor plan is finalized (DEL-02-01) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM -- price range for OPT-08 is $40k-$60k; more cameras could exceed range | Re-estimate after DEL-02-01 layout is available; obtain vendor quote with actual camera schedule | ASM-01, B-02 |
| RSK-02 | Scope boundary between camera system (DEL-05-04) and IT infrastructure (DEL-02-06) is unclear for network equipment | MEDIUM | MEDIUM -- potential for double-count or cost gap in network switches/PoE | Coordinate DEL-05-04 and DEL-02-06 estimates; define explicit scope split for network equipment before final pricing | ASM-03, B-03 |
| RSK-03 | Parametric pricing significantly under- or over-estimates actual vendor quote | HIGH | HIGH -- all lines are LOW confidence; OPT-08 range spans $20k ($40k-$60k) | Replace parametric pricing with competitive vendor quotes as soon as possible | DEC-EST-01 |
| RSK-04 | Monitoring service pricing does not reflect actual contract terms (multi-year, escalation, service levels) | MEDIUM | LOW -- annual cost is $5,400; variance within $3,600-$7,200 range | Obtain monitoring service proposals; confirm contract structure (annual vs multi-year) | ASM-04 |
| RSK-05 | Integration with access control (DEL-05-03) adds unpriced cost if both options are elected | LOW | LOW -- integration cost likely modest relative to system total | If both options are elected, add integration line item in a future estimate revision | ASM-05, DEC-EST-07 |
