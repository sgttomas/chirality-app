## Updated Assumptions

### ASM-0106-005 — Non-Labor Site Costs (UPDATED — was "unknown range")

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Temporary facilities/fencing estimated at $35,000 and site cleaning at $25,000, totaling $60,000 in parametric allowances. |
| Source | Parametric estimates based on typical Alberta rural construction site costs |
| Risk if Wrong | If site logistics are more complex (e.g., remote location, extreme weather provisions, larger perimeter fencing), temp facilities could be $50,000-80,000. If cleaning scope is minimal (e.g., DB self-performs), cleaning could be $10,000-15,000. |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Change from Prior | Prior run noted range of "$10,000-$20,000 (minor) to $50,000+ (significant)." This revision assigns specific parametric values within that range. |

### ASM-0106-006 — Rural Site Efficiency Factor (NEW)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Temp facilities cost compressed from component sum (~$60,000) to $35,000, reflecting: (a) rural Penhold site likely requires smaller perimeter fencing than urban site; (b) possible shared facilities with existing municipal operations; (c) simpler logistics for a 12-acre parcel with 4.5 acres developed. |
| Source | Professional judgment; typical rural Alberta municipal project |
| Risk if Wrong | If site has no shared facilities and requires full independent temporary infrastructure, the $60,000 component sum may be more appropriate. |
| Confidence | LOW |

### ASM-0106-007 — Final Clean Scope (NEW)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Final pre-occupancy clean covers both main PSB building (18,000 sf per PP-05) and cold storage (6,000 sf per PP-07), total 24,000 sf, at approximately $0.40/sf. |
| Source | Typical commercial construction final clean rates in Alberta |
| Risk if Wrong | If cold storage requires minimal cleaning (unfinished industrial space), reduce by ~$2,400. If main building has extensive finishes requiring specialized cleaning, increase rate to $0.60-0.80/sf. |
| Confidence | LOW |
