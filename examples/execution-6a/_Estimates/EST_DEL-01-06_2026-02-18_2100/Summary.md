## Key Warnings

1. **Non-labor costs are parametric allowances (LOW confidence).** The $60,000 in site general costs is based on parametric estimates for typical Alberta construction projects. Actual costs depend heavily on site conditions, duration, and DB logistics arrangements. Range could be $30,000-90,000.

2. **Hours are parametrically derived (carried forward).** Site Superintendent (1,440 hrs) and Construction Manager (60 hrs) quantities are PARAMETRIC basis from Level_of_Effort.csv.

3. **Mixed methods now present.** Labor lines are RATE_TABLE; site general cost lines are ALLOWANCE.
