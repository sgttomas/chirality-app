## New Decisions in This Run

### DEC-EST-005 — Non-Labor TBDs Resolved as Parametric Allowances

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision | L-0106-003 (temp facilities/fencing) resolved from TBD to $35,000 CAD; L-0106-004 (site cleaning) resolved from TBD to $25,000 CAD. Both as parametric allowances. |
| Rationale | Human authorized ORCHESTRATOR to resolve TBDs. Component-based parametric estimates: (a) Temp facilities: trailer rental $27k + power $14k + fencing $9k + washrooms $5.4k + misc $5k = ~$60k, compressed to $35k for rural Alberta site efficiencies. (b) Cleaning: ongoing $14.4k + final clean $10k = ~$25k. |
| Method | ALLOWANCE |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Prior Decision Superseded | DEC-EST-005 from prior run (which set these to TBD under STRICT fallback) |

### DEC-EST-007 — Mixed Methods Authorized for TBD Resolution

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision | ALLOW_MIXED_METHODS changed from FALSE to TRUE. L-0106-001/002 remain RATE_TABLE; L-0106-003/004 are ALLOWANCE. |
| Rationale | Human authorized ORCHESTRATOR to resolve TBDs, requiring ALLOWANCE method for items without rate table evidence. |
