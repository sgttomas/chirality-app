# Blockers Report — EST_DEL-01-06_2026-02-18_2100

## Summary

No blockers remain. All 4 line items are priced. The prior run's pricing gaps (temp facilities/fencing and site cleaning) have been resolved as parametric allowances.

## Dependency Evidence Review

Carried forward from prior run. No changes to dependency assessment. All dependencies are execution-phase prerequisites, not estimate-blocking inputs.

## Resolved Gaps

| Gap | Prior Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Temp facilities/fencing (L-0106-003) | TBD (no source) | $35,000 parametric allowance (LOW confidence) |
| Site cleaning (L-0106-004) | TBD (no source) | $25,000 parametric allowance (LOW confidence) |
