## Scope Coverage

- **In scope:** 1 deliverable (DEL-01-05)
- **Excluded:** 0
- **Blocked:** 0
- **Scope items covered:** SOW-0011 (meetings), SOW-0012 (documentation/change control)
- **Objective supported:** OBJ-008 (controlled Design-Build delivery)

## Key Assumptions

- Construction duration of 18 months (PP-01) drives the meeting frequency and admin effort basis.
- Biweekly meetings assumed per Level_of_Effort.csv notes (72h meetings + 18h change control admin = 90h PM).
- Admin hours (50h) cover minutes, RFI log, submittal tracking, and change order documentation over full project duration.
- Rates are bare labour cost (no overhead, markup, or profit included).
- No material or equipment costs apply to this deliverable.

## Warnings and Blockers

- **Warnings:** None.
- **Blockers:** No estimate-blocking dependencies identified. All upstream dependencies (contract award, Project Committee identification, PM identification) are execution prerequisites, not cost-information gaps.

## Cost Drivers (from brief)

- PM + admin hours
- Document control system costs: **not priced** (no evidence in PRICE_SOURCES for document control system/software costs; STRICT fallback policy applies; this is a potential gap if the client expects DMS licensing or setup costs to be carried here)
