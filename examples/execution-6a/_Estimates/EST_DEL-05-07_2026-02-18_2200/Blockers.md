# Blockers Report

## Summary

**No blockers identified.** All required inputs for estimating DEL-05-07 are available and sufficient.

## Dependency Assessment

| DependencyID | Class | Direction | Type | Target | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-0507-A001 | ANCHOR | UPSTREAM | OTHER | SOW-0506 (WBS node) | ACTIVE | None -- scope traceability only |
| DEP-0507-A002 | ANCHOR | UPSTREAM | OTHER | OBJ-010 (requirement) | ACTIVE | None -- objective traceability only |
| DEP-0507-E001 | EXECUTION | UPSTREAM | PREREQUISITE | Addendum 03 s1.18 | ACTIVE | None -- governing source is available and confirmed |
| DEP-0507-E002 | EXECUTION | UPSTREAM | INTERFACE | DEL-05-06 (Appliances & Laundry) | ACTIVE | **Interface noted** -- scope boundary coordination required to prevent double-counting. Brief provides explicit exclusion rules; no blocker to estimating. |

## Conclusion

All dependencies are satisfied or do not block the estimate. The DEL-05-06 interface (DEP-0507-E002) is an ongoing coordination item for design/procurement but does not prevent recording the fixed allowance value.
