L-0207-010,26-EMRG-GEN,PKG-002,DEL-02-07,Diesel generator system (100-150 kW complete: genset + ATS + fuel tank 72-hr + concrete pad + exhaust system + sound attenuation + commissioning),1,LS,150000,150000,CAD,ALLOWANCE,Equipment_Pricing.csv / EQ-04 (RecommendedPrice=$150000; Range=$120k-$180k),LOW,No vendor quote; ALLOWANCE fallback from parametric source. EQ-05 ATS ($12k) noted as included in EQ-04 system price. Requires vendor quote replacement.
L-0207-020,26-EMRG-DIST,PKG-002,DEL-02-07,Emergency power distribution from generator to essential loads (sub-panel + wiring + breakers for kitchen + meeting/command room + 2 bathrooms + emergency lighting),1,LS,18000,18000,CAD,ALLOWANCE,Decision_Log.md / DEC-EST-003; Assumptions_Log.md / ASM-005,LOW,Estimated as ~12% of generator system cost. No quote available. Covers dedicated sub-panel and branch circuits to essential loads only. Normal building distribution is DEL-02-06.
L-0207-030,26-EMRG-DOOR,PKG-002,DEL-02-07,Overhead door backup power mechanism integration (8 bay doors — battery backup motor or UPS for door openers),1,LS,16000,16000,CAD,ALLOWANCE,Decision_Log.md / DEC-EST-004; Assumptions_Log.md / ASM-006,LOW,8 doors x $2000/door assumed. Could be battery backup units or generator-fed circuits per door. Mechanism type TBD pending design. Cost ownership confirmed: DEL-02-07 owns backup mechanism; DEL-02-04 owns doors.
L-0207-040,26-EMRG-GEN,PKG-002,DEL-02-07,Generator installation labour (electrician + millwright + crane operator for equipment setting),1,LS,12000,12000,CAD,ALLOWANCE,Construction_Labour_Rates.csv / T-07 ($80/hr) + T-13 ($80/hr) + T-14 ($86/hr); Assumptions_Log.md / ASM-007,LOW,Estimated: Electrician 60 hrs ($4800) + Millwright 40 hrs ($3200) + Crane 2 days ($3440) + misc ($560). Actual labour included partially in EQ-04 system price; this line captures incremental site-specific installation scope.
L-0207-050,26-EMRG-DES,PKG-002,DEL-02-07,Electrical engineering design fees — generator sizing + specification + essential loads analysis,1,LS,5000,5000,CAD,ALLOWANCE,Professional_Design_Fees.csv / DF-05 (2.5% of electrical construction); Assumptions_Log.md / ASM-008,LOW,Generator-specific design portion only. DF-05 basis = 2.5% of DEL-02-07 construction cost (~$196k) = ~$4900 rounded to $5000. Full building electrical design is in DEL-02-06.
