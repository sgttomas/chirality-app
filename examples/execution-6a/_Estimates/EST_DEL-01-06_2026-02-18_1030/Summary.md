## Key Warnings

1. **Non-labor cost drivers not priced.** The brief identifies "temp facilities/fencing/cleaning" as cost drivers for DEL-01-06. No rate table, quote, or allowance evidence exists in PRICE_SOURCES for these items. Per STRICT fallback policy, they are recorded as TBD. The $203,700 total represents **labor only** and understates the full cost of this deliverable.

2. **Hours are parametrically derived.** The Level_of_Effort.csv quantities (1,440 hrs for Site Superintendent; 60 hrs for Construction Manager) are marked as PARAMETRIC basis within that source. The rate table prices them, but the quantities themselves are estimates derived from assumed project parameters (18-month construction duration per PP-01).

## Blockers (from dependency evidence)

No unresolved blockers prevent this estimate from being produced. All upstream dependencies (DEL-01-02, DEL-03-01, DEL-01-03) are execution-phase prerequisites for deliverable production, not estimate-blocking inputs. The cost structure of DEL-01-06 is duration-driven (Site Superintendent salary) and scope-driven (logistics/housekeeping), not dependent on predecessor deliverable outputs.
