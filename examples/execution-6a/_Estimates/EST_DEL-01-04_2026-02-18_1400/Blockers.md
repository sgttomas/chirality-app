## Informational Notes

- The Datasheet notes that the Town of Penhold fee schedule is TBD (Lensing item B-002). This is an informational gap but not a blocker -- ALLOWANCE method is authorized for uncertain fees.
- AHJ contact information is identified as missing factual data (Lensing item B-001). This does not affect cost estimation but is relevant for execution planning.
