# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-02-05_2026-02-18_1400

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source / Basis | Impact if Wrong | Confidence |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| ASM-01 | Main PSB building footprint (18,000 sf per PP-05) is split into three zones: apparatus bays 6,400 sf (4 x 1,600 sf), PW shop bays 6,400 sf (4 x 1,600 sf), institutional/shared 5,200 sf (remainder). | PP-05 (18,000 sf DESIGN_BASIS, MED confidence); bay count per PP-11/PP-12 (CONFIRMED). Bay size of ~1,600 sf (~40x40 ft) is assumed based on drive-through apparatus bay sizing for Type 1 engines. | If actual bay areas differ, HVAC and plumbing amounts (L-01 through L-05) shift proportionally. A 10% shift in bay vs institutional area changes total by approximately $15,000-$20,000. | MED |
| ASM-02 | All rate-table recommended rates (mid-range values) are used rather than min or max. | Pricing CSVs provide RateMin, RateMax, and RecommendedRate. Using recommended values per standard practice for Class 3-4 estimating. | Using max rates would increase total by ~$200,000; using min rates would decrease by ~$150,000. | MED |
| ASM-03 | BAS/controls (MS-12, L-11) is applied to full 18,000 sf building area. | Building automation typically covers the entire building envelope for monitoring and control. | If BAS is limited to institutional areas only (5,200 sf), L-11 drops from $72,000 to $20,800. | MED |
| ASM-04 | Fire protection (L-12) is required by AHJ. | MS-05 notes conditional requirement. Included as precaution; LOW confidence. | If not required, remove $108,000 from total. | LOW |
| ASM-05 | Kitchen/laundry plumbing rough-in (L-13) estimated at approximately 100 hours of plumber time ($82/hr). | Scope per brief: "Kitchen/laundry rough-in (plumbing stubs)" owned by DEL-02-05. Labour rate from T-05. Hours estimated based on typical rough-in scope (hot/cold water stubs, drain stubs, vent stubs for 2 laundry sets, kitchen sink, dishwasher). | If scope is larger (e.g., gas rough-in for stove), cost increases. If minimal (water stubs only), cost decreases. Range: $4,000-$12,000. | MED |
| ASM-06 | Base building mechanical rough-in to wash bay location (L-14) estimated at approximately 73 hours of plumber time ($82/hr). | Brief states this is owned by DEL-02-05: "Base building mechanical rough-in to wash bay location." Scope is hot/cold water supply stubs + drain stub to the designated wash bay location. | If wash bay is not elected (DEL-05-01), the rough-in is still provided as base building infrastructure. | MED |
| ASM-07 | System-specific commissioning labour (L-16) estimated at 225 hours of blended mechanical trade time at $80/hr. | Brief assigns "System-specific commissioning labor (mechanical balancing)" to DEL-02-05. Scope includes TAB (testing, adjusting, balancing), functional performance testing of HVAC/plumbing/exhaust systems. Blended rate of T-05 ($82/hr) and T-06 ($78/hr). | If commissioning scope is more extensive (e.g., includes BAS programming validation), hours could increase to 300+. Range: $14,000-$24,000. | MED |
