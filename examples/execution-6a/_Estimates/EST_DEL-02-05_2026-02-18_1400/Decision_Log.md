| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| DEC-01 | Treat price source rates as RATE_TABLE entries despite source CSV metadata labeling them as `Basis=PARAMETRIC` | The rates are structured tabular values (ItemID, Unit, RecommendedRate) provided as project pricing inputs. The `PARAMETRIC` label in source metadata describes how the rates were originally derived, not how they are applied in this estimate. They function as a rate table for estimating purposes. | All 16 lines use Method=RATE_TABLE; no mixed-methods violation. |
| DEC-02 | Apply area-based rates to three building zones (apparatus bays, PW bays, institutional) rather than a single blended rate | Different mechanical system complexity and scope between institutional (full HVAC/plumbing) and bay (heated only, minimal plumbing) areas requires zone-specific rates for accuracy. Zone splits documented in ASM-01. | More accurate total than a single blended rate; zone areas are assumptions to be validated. |
| DEC-03 | Mechanical design fees calculated as 2.5% of construction subtotal (L-01 through L-14 = $971,800), rounded to nearest dollar | DF-04 in Professional_Design_Fees.csv recommends 2.5% of mechanical construction cost. Applied to the sum of all construction line items excluding the design fee itself and commissioning. 2.5% x $971,800 = $24,295, rounded to $24,295. | Design fee = $24,295; included as L-15. |
| DEC-04 | Fire protection (L-12) included at recommended rate with LOW confidence | MS-05 notes "If required by AHJ; may not be required for this occupancy." Including it ensures the estimate is not under-stated if AHJ requires sprinklers, while LOW confidence flags the conditionality. | $108,000 included; total with fire protection = $1,014,095; total without = $906,095. |
| DEC-05 | Bay plumbing (MS-04) applied to combined apparatus + PW bay area (12,800 sf) | Both bay types have bay sumps, hose bibs, and minimal plumbing. Sumps are priced separately in L-09; MS-04 rate covers the remaining bay plumbing infrastructure. | $76,800 for bay plumbing; no double-count with L-09 sump assemblies (different scope). |
| DEC-06 | Compressed air equipment excluded per cost ownership rules | Brief explicitly states compressed air EQUIPMENT (compressor, piping, drops) is owned by DEL-02-02. CON-M-01 scope boundary is unresolved but the brief provides a clear ruling for this estimate. | $0 for compressed air in this estimate. |
| DEC-07 | Commissioning labour (L-16) priced as lump sum using blended trade rates | Brief states "System-specific commissioning labor (mechanical balancing)" is owned by DEL-02-05. Estimated at 225 hours of blended plumber/sheet-metal-worker time at $80/hr. | $18,000 lump sum. |
