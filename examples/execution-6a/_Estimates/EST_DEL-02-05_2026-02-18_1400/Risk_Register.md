# Risk Register -- EST_DEL-02-05_2026-02-18_1400

| RiskID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Related Lines |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| RSK-01 | Fire protection may not be required by AHJ, leading to over-estimation of $108,000 | MEDIUM | HIGH ($108k / 10.7% of total) | AHJ confirmation during design phase; estimate clearly flags this as conditional with LOW confidence | L-12 |
| RSK-02 | Actual building zone areas differ from assumed 6,400/6,400/5,200 split | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (~$15-20k per 10% area shift) | Validate against architectural layout from DEL-02-01 when available; rerun estimate | L-01 through L-05 |
| RSK-03 | Compressed air scope boundary (CON-M-01) resolution could add scope to DEL-02-05 | LOW | MEDIUM ($55,000 if breathing air system added per MS-08) | Brief excludes compressed air from DEL-02-05; if boundary ruling changes, add MS-08 pricing | N/A (currently excluded) |
| RSK-04 | BAS/controls scope may be broader or narrower than full-building application | LOW | MEDIUM ($20k-$72k range depending on coverage) | Confirm BAS scope during design; adjust L-11 area as needed | L-11 |
