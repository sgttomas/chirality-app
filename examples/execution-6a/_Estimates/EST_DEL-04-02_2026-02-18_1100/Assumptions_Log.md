## Assumptions

### ASM-01: Overhead Door Supply Price Includes Opener
**ID:** ASM-01
**Statement:** The EQ-02 recommended price of $13,500/each is assumed to include the motorized opener with remote control as a complete supply package (door panel, tracks, springs, motor operator, remote receiver).
**Basis:** EQ-02 description states "motorized" and the price range ($12,000-$15,000) is consistent with a complete overhead door package at standard grade.
**Impact if wrong:** If opener is separate, add approximately $3,000-$5,000 per door ($6,000-$10,000 total increase).
**Affected lines:** L-0402-01.

### ASM-02: Person Doors are Standard Single-Leaf Commercial
**ID:** ASM-02
**Statement:** Person doors are assumed to be standard single-leaf hollow metal doors with 16 ga frames, approximately 36" x 84" (3'-0" x 7'-0") size, adequate for code-minimum commercial egress.
**Basis:** Datasheet states code-minimum commercial egress; BE-11 description matches "Hollow metal door and frame (single; commercial)."
**Impact if wrong:** If larger or specialty doors required, price could increase by $500-$1,000 per door.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-02.

### ASM-03: Overhead Door Hardware Supplement
**ID:** ASM-03
**Statement:** An additional hardware allowance of $600 per overhead door (equivalent to one commercial hardware set from BE-13) is assumed for guides, seals, bottom bars, and miscellaneous items not included in the EQ-02 supply price.
**Basis:** EQ-02 may or may not include all ancillary hardware. One commercial hardware set per opening is a reasonable supplement.
**Impact if wrong:** If EQ-02 is fully inclusive, this is a $1,200 overestimate. If more hardware is needed, it could be understated.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-04.

### ASM-04: Concrete Apron Dimensions
**ID:** ASM-04
**Statement:** Each concrete apron is assumed to be approximately 50 m2 (approximately 7.5m wide x 6.7m deep, or roughly 24.5 ft x 22 ft). Width accommodates the 16 ft (4.88m) door opening plus 1.3m each side for vehicle approach alignment. Depth of 6.7m (22 ft) provides adequate turning/approach distance for service vehicles.
**Basis:** No apron dimensions specified in OSR or Datasheet; dimensions are proportional to door size and consistent with typical industrial overhead door approach aprons.
**Impact if wrong:** +/- 25% area variation would change apron cost by approximately +/- $2,700 per apron.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-05, L-0402-10.

### ASM-05: Perimeter Sealant Lengths
**ID:** ASM-05
**Statement:** Sealant perimeter for overhead doors is calculated as 2 x (4.88m + 4.88m) = 19.5 lm per opening (16 ft = 4.88m). Person door perimeter is 2 x (0.81m + 2.03m) = 5.7 lm per opening (32" = 0.81m, 80" = 2.03m).
**Basis:** Metric conversion of specified door dimensions; perimeter = 2 x (width + height).
**Impact if wrong:** Minor; sealant is a small cost item.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-06, L-0402-07.

### ASM-06: Weatherstrip Allowance Beyond Sealant
**ID:** ASM-06
**Statement:** An additional $200 per overhead door opening and $40 per person door opening is assumed for weatherstrip material beyond perimeter sealant (brush seals, bottom astragals, compression seals).
**Basis:** Typical commercial overhead door weatherstrip kits cost $150-$250 installed; person door weatherstrip is typically $30-$50.
**Impact if wrong:** Minor; combined allowance is $480.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-06, L-0402-07.

### ASM-07: Overhead Door Installation Labour
**ID:** ASM-07
**Statement:** Installation of each overhead door (including unloading, assembly, hanging, opener installation, and adjustment) is assumed to require 16 carpenter-hours per door.
**Basis:** Typical 16x16 ft motorized overhead door installation by a 2-person crew takes 1 full day (8 hrs x 2 workers = 16 person-hours).
**Impact if wrong:** +/- 4 hrs per door would change labour cost by approximately +/- $288 per door.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-08.

### ASM-08: Person Door Installation Labour
**ID:** ASM-08
**Statement:** Installation of each person door (frame set, door hang, hardware install) is assumed to require 4 carpenter-hours per door.
**Basis:** Standard commercial hollow metal door installation typically takes one carpenter 4 hours.
**Impact if wrong:** Minor; +/- 1 hr per door = +/- $72 per door.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-09.

### ASM-09: Concrete Apron Installation Labour and Blended Rate
**ID:** ASM-09
**Statement:** Each concrete apron requires 24 hours of combined concrete finisher and general labourer time. A blended rate of $62/hr is used, derived as the average of T-04 Concrete Finisher ($68/hr) and T-01 General Labourer ($55/hr).
**Basis:** 50 m2 heavy-duty slab: forming (8 hrs), placement + vibrating (8 hrs), finishing + curing (8 hrs) = 24 hrs per apron. Typical crew is one finisher + one labourer.
**Impact if wrong:** +/- 8 hrs per apron at blended rate = +/- $496 per apron.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-10.

### ASM-10: Emergency Exit Light Unit Rate
**ID:** ASM-10
**Statement:** Emergency exit lights with battery backup are assumed at $350/each installed. This covers a commercial LED exit light fixture with integral battery pack, including installation labour.
**Basis:** Typical commercial LED exit/emergency combo units cost $150-$250 supply; installation labour 2 hrs x $80/hr electrician = $160; total $310-$410, mid-point approximately $350.
**Impact if wrong:** +/- $100 per unit = +/- $200 total.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-11.

### ASM-11: Weatherproof Light Switch Unit Rate
**ID:** ASM-11
**Statement:** Weatherproof light switches at person doors are assumed at $85/each installed. This covers a NEMA-rated weatherproof switch assembly including box, cover, and installation labour.
**Basis:** Typical weatherproof switch + box $25-$35 supply; installation labour 0.75 hrs x $80/hr electrician = $60; total $85-$95.
**Impact if wrong:** Negligible; +/- $20 per unit = +/- $40 total.
**Affected lines:** L-0402-12.
