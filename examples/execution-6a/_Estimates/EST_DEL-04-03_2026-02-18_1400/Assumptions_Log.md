## Estimating Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Screw pile count is 20 for the 60'x100' PEMB building | Typical PEMB perimeter column spacing of 20-25 ft; 60'x100' clear-span layout | +/- 4 piles = +/- $12,000 on total | MED |
| ASM-002 | All screw piles are priced at the SC-14 recommended rate of $3,000/each | SC-14 rate covers 2.75-3.5 in shaft, 6-8 m depth typical for Penhold soils | If pile depth exceeds 8 m or larger shaft required, rate could increase 20-30% | MED |
| ASM-003 | Floor slab thickness of 150mm with W/W mesh (SC-03) is adequate for cold storage equipment loads | Standard storage building slab; floor live load is TBD per Datasheet [B-001] | If heavy equipment (e.g., large forklifts, loaded graders) requires heavier slab, upgrade to 200mm reinforced (SC-04) would add ~$13,000 | MED |
| ASM-004 | Design life for the ancillary cold storage building is 50 years (matching main building) | Assumed per Guidance [A-005]; not confirmed by Owner | If shorter design life (25 years), lower-cost materials could be acceptable; if confirmed at 50 years, the concrete slab selection is appropriate | MED |
| ASM-005 | Sulphate-resistant concrete mix cost is embedded in the SC-03 and SC-04 unit rates | SC-03/SC-04 rates are described as "standard" but the Penhold site requires Type HS cement (Class S-2 sulphate exposure) | Type HS cement typically adds 5-10% to concrete material cost; if not included in SC-03/SC-04, total concrete cost could increase by $3,000-$5,000 | MED |
| ASM-006 | Grade beam quantity is 80 linear metres (connecting screw pile caps around perimeter) | Perimeter of 60'x100' building is 320 ft = 97.5 m; 80 lm net accounts for pile cap locations and typical beam configuration | +/- 20 lm = +/- $4,400 | MED |
| ASM-007 | Subgrade preparation rate of $12/m2 is appropriate for building footprint stripping, scarifying, compacting, and proof rolling | Derived from typical Alberta earthwork rates; no direct rate table item available | Rate could vary +/- 30% ($8-$16/m2) depending on soil conditions at the specific cold storage footprint location | MED |
| ASM-008 | Granular base (radon rock) rate of $15/m2 is appropriate for 150mm depth of screened/washed 20mm rock | Derived rate; no direct rate table item; potential partial overlap with SC-03 "includes sub-base prep" | If SC-03 already fully includes the granular base, this line item (L-007, $8,355) would be a double-count. Conversely, if radon rock is a separate specification beyond standard sub-base, the rate is reasonable. | MED |
| ASM-009 | Vapour barrier rate of $5/m2 is appropriate for 6-mil poly sheeting with laps and sealing | Derived rate; no direct rate table item; minimum thickness assumed per REQ-08 [E-002] | Rate is standard for this material; low risk of variance (+/- $1/m2 = +/- $557) | MED |
| ASM-010 | Reinforcing steel quantity of 1,500 kg covers grade beam rebar and supplemental slab edge reinforcing | W/W mesh for main slab area is included in SC-03 rate; this line item covers additional rebar for grade beams and slab edges/joints | Actual quantity depends on structural engineering; +/- 500 kg = +/- $1,625 | MED |
| ASM-011 | Anchor bolt count of 80 (4 per pile x 20 piles) is adequate for screw pile to grade beam connections | Standard connection detail; 4 bolts per pile cap is typical | Low sensitivity; +/- 20 bolts = +/- $900 | MED |
| ASM-012 | Concrete apron dimensions: OH door aprons at 16'x16' footprint (matching door opening); person door aprons at 1.5m x 2.0m | REQ-06 requires aprons at all door openings; sizing based on door dimensions and typical approach pad requirements | OH door aprons may need to extend beyond the door opening (e.g., 20'x20' for truck turning); this could add ~$2,000-$3,000 | MED |
