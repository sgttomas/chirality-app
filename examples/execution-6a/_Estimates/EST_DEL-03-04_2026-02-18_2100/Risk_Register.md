## Risks Identified

| RiskID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Exposure (CAD) | Source | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| RSK-001 | Actual utility run lengths significantly differ from assumed 120 m / 40 m due to actual stub locations and building siting | MEDIUM | HIGH | +/-$30,000 to $40,000 | ASM-001, ASM-002; DEP-03-04-006, DEP-03-04-007 | Rerun estimate with actual survey data post-award |
| RSK-002 | DEC-004 tie-in allowance ($35,000) is insufficient to cover actual tie-in execution costs | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | +$15,000 (if actual = $50,000 high end of UU-12 range) | UU-12 range $25K-$50K; DEC-004 | Owner to confirm allowance value; DB to provide detailed scope breakdown with proposal |
| RSK-003 | Utility connection fees exceed recommended parametric values | MEDIUM | LOW | +$10,000 to $20,000 | FP-11 through FP-15; ASM-013 | Obtain actual fee schedules from Town and providers during design |
| RSK-004 | Cold Storage Building requires additional utility services (sanitary, telecom) not currently included | LOW | LOW | +$17,000 (sanitary $13K + telecom $4K) | ASM-005, ASM-006 | Confirm requirements during design development |
| RSK-005 | Common trench double-counting (UU-09 cost additive to individual utility rates which include trench) | LOW | LOW | -$10,000 (overstatement) | ASM-009; RD-008 | Conservative: no credit taken; actual construction may realize savings |
| RSK-006 | Unknown underground conditions (rock, contamination, high water table) increase trenching costs | LOW | HIGH | +$20,000 to $50,000 | DEP-03-04-008 (geotech report available but not reviewed in this run) | Review geotechnical report for trench-specific conditions |

## Risk Exposure Summary

| Category | Count | Total Exposure Range |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Quantity uncertainty (RSK-001) | 1 | +/-$30,000 to $40,000 |
| Allowance adequacy (RSK-002) | 1 | +$15,000 |
| Fee uncertainty (RSK-003) | 1 | +$10,000 to $20,000 |
| Scope uncertainty (RSK-004) | 1 | +$17,000 |
| Conservative bias (RSK-005) | 1 | -$10,000 |
| Unknown conditions (RSK-006) | 1 | +$20,000 to $50,000 |

**Net risk exposure range (excluding conservative bias):** approximately +$30,000 to +$125,000 above current estimate, or approximately +13% to +55% of the $226,930 total. This wide range reflects the proposal-stage maturity of inputs.
