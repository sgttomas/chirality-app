# Blockers Report: EST_DEL-03-04_2026-02-18_2100

## Summary

4 upstream prerequisites are in PENDING status. None block the estimate run (assumptions used), but all represent material information gaps that should be resolved for a higher-confidence rerun.

## Blockers by Deliverable

### DEL-03-04 -- Site Utilities Distribution & Allowance-Based Tie-Ins

| # | Blocker Description | DependencyID | Status | Source | Estimate Impact | Resolution Path |
|---|-------------------|-------------|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Owner-provided underground services drawings not yet received | DEP-03-04-006 | PENDING | OSR 10.3.2 | HIGH: Actual utility stub locations, depths, and distances needed to replace assumed run lengths (ASM-001, ASM-002) | Post-award: Owner to provide drawings per OSR 10.3.2 |
| 2 | Survey files from civil engineering firm not yet received | DEP-03-04-007 | PENDING | Addendum 03 s1.20 | HIGH: Site layout and topography needed for accurate utility routing | Post-award: Owner to provide survey files per Addendum 03 s1.20 |
| 3 | Town of Penhold municipal servicing standards not yet obtained | DEP-03-04-009 | PENDING | Procedure prerequisites | MEDIUM: May affect pipe specifications, connection methods, and fees | Design phase: DB to obtain from Town |
| 4 | Utility Provider connection standards and applications not yet obtained | DEP-03-04-010 | PENDING | REQ-01; RFP s7.3.3 | MEDIUM: Provider-specific requirements may change connection costs | Design phase: DB to obtain from each provider |

## Upstream Interfaces (not blockers; parallel progression expected)

| Interface | DependencyID | Impact on Estimate |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| DEL-03-01 (Site Plan, Circulation, Parking) | DEP-03-04-011 | Building locations affect utility routing; current assumed run lengths are consistent with typical site layout |
| DEL-03-02 (Grading, Earthworks, Drainage) | DEP-03-04-012 | Grading affects trench depths; UU rates assume 1.5-2.0m depth which is typical for Alberta freeze depth |

## Estimate Approach Given Blockers

The estimate proceeds with assumed quantities (ASM-001 through ASM-007) and recommended parametric values where actual data is pending. This is appropriate for proposal-stage budgeting. A rerun with actual survey data is recommended post-award when DEP-03-04-006 and DEP-03-04-007 are satisfied.

## DEC-004 Status

The DEC-004 utility tie-in allowance value ($35,000) is PENDING OWNER CONFIRMATION. This is not a blocker to the estimate (the recommended value from UU-12 is used), but the Owner must confirm or set the final allowance amount before the estimate can be finalized.
