## RISK-001 — Cut/Fill Quantity Variance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Quantity risk |
| Likelihood | HIGH (quantities are assumed, not measured) |
| Impact | HIGH ($105,000 or 22% of total based on assumptions ASM-001, ASM-002) |
| Description | Cut and fill volumes are not extracted from TPN46 drawings or survey. Actual quantities could differ significantly from the 3,000 m3 cut / 2,000 m3 fill assumptions. If site requires more cut (e.g., for pond + grade) or more imported fill (e.g., for building pads on soft subgrade), costs could escalate substantially. |
| Affected Lines | L-003, L-004 |
| Mitigation | Civil engineer to perform quantity takeoff from TPN46 or post-award survey as priority. Consider requesting TPN46 digital files from Owner. |

## RISK-002 — Stormwater Pond Scope Expansion

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Design uncertainty |
| Likelihood | MEDIUM |
| Impact | MEDIUM-HIGH ($52,500 at risk; could increase to $100,000+ if pond is significantly larger or requires engineered liner/structure) |
| Description | Pond sizing criteria are TBD (REQ-3212/item F-001). Municipal development standards may require larger pond capacity than assumed. Pond may be in flood fringe requiring AEPA Water Act approval and possible design modifications (setbacks, liner, armoring). |
| Affected Lines | L-010, L-011 |
| Mitigation | Early engagement with Town of Penhold on municipal development standards; coordinate with DEL-03-05 on AEPA approval timeline. |

## RISK-003 — AEPA Water Act Approval Delay or Conditions

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Regulatory / schedule risk |
| Likelihood | MEDIUM (noted as PENDING in brief) |
| Impact | MEDIUM (could add $10,000-$50,000 in additional earthwork near waterway; could also delay earthworks start) |
| Description | External gate notes AEPA Water Act approval is PENDING. If approval requires additional setbacks, mitigation earthwork, or design changes for earthwork near Waskasoo Creek, costs and schedule may be affected. Environmental consultant costs are in DEL-03-05, but physical earthwork changes would affect DEL-03-02. |
| Affected Lines | L-009, L-010, L-011 |
| Mitigation | Conservative assumptions applied (ASM-007). Coordinate with DEL-03-05 for early regulatory engagement. |

## RISK-004 — Soil Conditions Variance from Geotech Report

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Ground condition risk |
| Likelihood | LOW-MEDIUM (geotech report is from Feb 2021; conditions may have changed) |
| Impact | MEDIUM (could require additional geotech investigation per REQ-3214, additional sub-excavation, or dewatering) |
| Description | Geotech report (USG1123) is 5 years old. Groundwater levels, soil conditions, or fill quality may have changed. Datasheet notes trigger criteria for "insufficient" geotech report are TBD (item B-002). High plasticity clay is frost-active (volume changes). Cobbles/boulders possible in till layer. |
| Affected Lines | L-003, L-004, L-007, L-014 |
| Mitigation | L-014 includes $32,000 for geotechnical services which covers supplemental testing if needed. If full new investigation is required, additional cost of ~$25,000-$40,000 (EC-10 range). |

## RISK-005 — Topsoil/Seeding Area Variance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Quantity risk |
| Likelihood | MEDIUM |
| Impact | LOW-MEDIUM ($110,000 line item; variance of +/-20% = +/-$22,000) |
| Description | Disturbed area for topsoil replacement depends on final site layout (DEL-03-01) and paving extents (DEL-03-03). Estimate of 10,000 m2 could be higher if more area is disturbed during construction or lower if more area is paved. |
| Affected Lines | L-012 |
| Mitigation | Area will be refined once DEL-03-01 site plan is finalized. |
