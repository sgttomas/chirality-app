| RiskID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Related |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-01 | AEPA conditions of Water Act approval impose additional mitigation requirements (e.g., construction-phase environmental monitoring, post-construction monitoring, additional setback buffers) that require consultant services beyond FP-17 scope. | MEDIUM | MEDIUM ($10,000-$30,000 additional) | Confirm AEPA application status early in design phase; request pre-consultation with AEPA to scope conditions. | DEP-3505-E06, DEP-3505-E12, ASM-01, ASM-05 |
| RSK-02 | 2021 Wetland Assessment and Environmental Assessment have lapsed or are deemed insufficient by AEPA, requiring new assessments. | LOW-MEDIUM | HIGH ($15,000-$30,000+ for new assessments + new ABWRET-A calculation) | Confirm with AEPA whether 2021 reports remain accepted as basis for Water Act application. | ASM-02, ASM-03 |
| RSK-03 | ABWRET-A wetland replacement fee has been recalculated by AEPA at a different amount than the 2021 figure of $10,769.54. | LOW | LOW-MEDIUM (delta could be +/- $2,000-$5,000) | Confirm current ABWRET-A fee with AEPA or through updated assessment. | ASM-03, L-03 |
| RSK-04 | Town of Penhold imposes additional flood fringe development conditions requiring additional environmental consultant effort or additional regulatory applications. | LOW-MEDIUM | MEDIUM ($5,000-$15,000) | Engage Town planning department early to confirm flood fringe development requirements. | DEP-3505-E13, ASM-04 |
| RSK-05 | Upstream DEL-03-02 outputs reveal that stormwater discharge points or earthwork volumes near the flood fringe require additional environmental assessment or regulatory coordination. | MEDIUM | MEDIUM ($5,000-$15,000) | Coordinate DEL-03-02 and DEL-03-05 concurrently; flag any flood fringe earthwork volumes for environmental review. | DEP-3505-E07, DEP-3505-E08 |
