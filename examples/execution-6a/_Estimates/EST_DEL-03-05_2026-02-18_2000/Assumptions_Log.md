# Assumptions Log

## Run: EST_DEL-03-05_2026-02-18_2000

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Risk if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-01 | Environmental consultant scope (L-01) includes flood hazard assessment, wetland assessment update, AEPA interface, and regulatory coordination as described in FP-17. No additional specialist studies (e.g., species-at-risk, historical resources) are required beyond the 2021 Ghostpine assessments. | FP-17 description; Datasheet.md indicates no sensitive/endangered species documented during May 2021 survey; Desktop Environmental Assessment confirms agricultural land use with minimal native vegetation. | If additional specialist studies are required by AEPA conditions, consultant fees would increase beyond the $15,000-$30,000 range. Estimate would need re-pricing. |
| ASM-02 | AEPA Water Act application has been initiated (per Wetland Assessment Executive Summary, Aug. 2021) and the application process is still active. No re-application or new assessment is required. | Wetland Assessment Executive Summary states application is for "infill on-site temporary marsh (DW01), seasonal marsh (DW02), ephemeral drainages, and one ephemeral waterbody." | If the 2021 application has lapsed or conditions have changed, a new wetland assessment and application may be required, adding $15,000-$30,000+ in additional consultant fees and a new ABWRET-A fee calculation. |
| ASM-03 | ABWRET-A wetland replacement fee of $10,769.54 (from 2021 Wetland Assessment) remains valid and has not been adjusted by AEPA. | Wetland Assessment Executive Summary (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021). Fee calculated using ABWRET-A tool at that time. | If AEPA has updated fee schedules or the wetland impact area has changed, the fee could differ. The 2021 figure is used as best available evidence. |
| ASM-04 | The development permit fee for flood fringe approval is incremental to the base development permit (carried in DEL-01-04). The $1,200 allowance (FP-07) represents the full incremental cost. | FP-07 range $500-$2,000. Used as proxy for the flood fringe approval component. | If the Town of Penhold requires a separate flood fringe application with a higher fee, or if the development permit fee is significantly different from FP-07, the amount would change. |
| ASM-05 | No additional environmental monitoring or reporting requirements will be imposed by AEPA conditions of Water Act approval that require ongoing consultant presence beyond what is included in FP-17. | FP-17 range covers initial assessment and regulatory coordination. | If AEPA conditions require ongoing environmental monitoring (e.g., construction-phase monitoring, post-construction monitoring), these would be additional costs not captured in this estimate. |
| ASM-06 | ESC plan preparation (L-04, FP-18) covers engineering design and monitoring plan preparation only. Physical ESC installation and maintenance costs are carried in DEL-03-02 (EC-07). | Cost ownership rules: DEL-03-05 = professional services; DEL-03-02 = physical construction. | If the ESC plan preparation scope is larger than expected (e.g., requires multiple iterations due to AEPA conditions), the $4,500 may be insufficient. |
| ASM-07 | Site Grading drawings (DEP-3505-E05) will be provided by the Owner post-award at no additional cost to the Design-Builder. | Addendum 03 s1.20 states grading drawings are provided to the award winner. | If drawings are not provided or require significant interpretation/conversion, additional consultant effort may be needed. |
