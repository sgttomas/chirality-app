### Key Warnings

1. **AEPA Water Act approval PENDING.** Conditions of approval may impose additional mitigation costs not captured in this estimate. The ABWRET-A fee ($10,770) is based on the 2021 Wetland Assessment and may be subject to update.
2. **Mixed methods in use.** Two line items (L-02, L-05) are priced as ALLOWANCE because fee schedules are uncertain. These total $6,200 (14% of estimate).
3. **Upstream deliverable interface (DEL-03-02) unresolved.** Stormwater management approach and earthwork cut/fill volumes are needed to confirm environmental mitigation scope. Additional consultant effort could result.
4. **Development permit fee (L-05) is an incremental component only.** The base development permit is expected to be carried in DEL-01-04. If this assumption is incorrect, the full permit fee should be reallocated.
5. **2021 assessment validity.** Both the Wetland Assessment and Desktop Environmental Assessment are from 2021. If AEPA requires updated assessments (due to elapsed time or changed conditions), significant additional consultant fees would be incurred.

### Blockers Summary

- 4 external regulatory blockers (AEPA + Town approvals -- all PENDING)
- 2 upstream deliverable interfaces (DEL-03-02 outputs needed)
- Net impact: Professional services are priceable. Regulatory fees are ALLOWANCE where uncertain. Additional costs may emerge from conditions of approval.
