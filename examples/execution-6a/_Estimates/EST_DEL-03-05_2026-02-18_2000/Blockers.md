### DEL-03-05 -- Environmental Constraints, Flood Hazard & Regulatory Compliance

#### External Regulatory Blockers

| # | Blocker | DependencyID | Status | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AEPA Water Act application status confirmation | DEP-3505-E06 | TBD / PENDING | Does not block professional service fee pricing; blocks confirmation of scope completeness (e.g., whether additional studies or conditions will add cost) |
| 2 | AEPA Water Act approval letter | DEP-3505-E12 | TBD / PENDING | Blocks confirmation that ABWRET-A fee ($10,770) is the final obligation; conditions of approval may impose additional mitigation costs |
| 3 | Town of Penhold Development Permit | DEP-3505-E13 | TBD / PENDING | Blocks confirmation of flood fringe development conditions; may impose additional requirements |
| 4 | Fill placement acceptance (Town + AEPA) | DEP-3505-E14 | TBD / PENDING | Blocks confirmation of earthwork constraints; physical cost impact belongs to DEL-03-02, not DEL-03-05 |

#### Upstream Deliverable Interfaces (Information Needed)

| # | Information Needed | Source Deliverable | DependencyID | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Stormwater management approach and discharge points | DEL-03-02 | DEP-3505-E07 | Needed to complete environmental mitigation notes scope; may reveal additional environmental consultant effort |
| 6 | Earthwork cut/fill volumes relative to flood fringe | DEL-03-02 | DEP-3505-E08 | Needed to assess fill placement compliance scope; may reveal additional regulatory coordination effort |

#### Document Prerequisites (Status Unknown)

| # | Document | DependencyID | Available? | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit | DEP-3505-E01 | Assumed available (referenced in Datasheet) | Required input; if unavailable, flood hazard constraints map cannot be assembled |
| 8 | Parcel Flood Zone exhibit | DEP-3505-E02 | Assumed available (referenced in Datasheet) | Required input for flood zone delineation |
| 9 | Wetland Assessment and Impact Report | DEP-3505-E03 | Assumed available (referenced in Datasheet; read during analysis) | Required for wetland delineation and Water Act application basis |
| 10 | Desktop/Field Environmental Assessment | DEP-3505-E04 | Assumed available (referenced in Datasheet; read during analysis) | Required for environmental baseline |
| 11 | Site Grading drawings | DEP-3505-E05 | Post-award (per Addendum 03 s1.20) | Required for grade integration; not available until after award |

### Summary

- **4 external regulatory blockers** (AEPA and Town of Penhold approvals) -- all PENDING
- **2 upstream deliverable interfaces** (DEL-03-02 outputs needed)
- **5 document prerequisites** -- 4 assumed available; 1 post-award
- **Net impact on estimate:** Professional service fees are priceable despite blockers. Regulatory fees are priced as ALLOWANCE where uncertain. Additional costs may emerge from AEPA conditions of approval (not priced -- would require re-estimate).
