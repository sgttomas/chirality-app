# Blockers Report — EST_DEL-02-01_2026-02-18_2100

## Pricing Blockers

**None.** All 10 line items are priced. The prior run's pricing blocker (PB-01: missing rate table entries) has been resolved by the addition of Interior_Architectural_Rates.csv (PS-27). The dependent blocker (PB-02: design fee computation) is also resolved.

## Resolved Blockers

| Prior Blocker | Resolution |
|---|---|
| PB-01: No rate table entries for partitions, ceiling, floor finish, paint, accessibility, signage | Interior_Architectural_Rates.csv (PS-27) provides all needed rates |
| PB-02: Design fee dependent on incomplete construction subtotal | Construction subtotal now complete ($157,317); fee computed at $11,012 |
