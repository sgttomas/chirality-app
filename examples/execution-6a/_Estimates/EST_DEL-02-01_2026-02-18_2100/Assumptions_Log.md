## New Assumptions

### ASM-010 — Partition Type Blend (70/20/10)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Interior partition walls assumed to be 70% non-rated (IA-02 at $82/m2), 20% fire-rated (IA-01 at $112/m2), and 10% wet-area (IA-04 at $132/m2), yielding a blended rate of $93/m2. |
| Source | Typical institutional office/admin building partition distribution |
| Risk if Wrong | If fire-rated partitions are required for a larger proportion (e.g., 40%), blended rate increases to ~$102/m2 (+$2,925). If wet area proportion is higher (e.g., 20%), blended rate increases to ~$96/m2 (+$975). |
| Confidence | MED |

### ASM-011 — Accessibility Component Counts

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | 6 accessible door hardware upgrades, 8 m2 tactile walking surface indicators, 2 barrier-free washroom packages, 1 accessible signage package. |
| Source | Typical Alberta Building Code requirements for a public-use building of this type |
| Risk if Wrong | If more doors require accessible hardware (e.g., all 19 openings), cost increases by ~$4,225. If more washrooms require barrier-free upgrade, add $1,100/washroom. |
| Confidence | MED |

### ASM-012 — Signage Counts (14 exit + 28 room + 1 fire package)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | 14 illuminated exit signs based on building layout and egress requirements. 28 room identification signs based on room count estimate. 1 fire safety signage package for the building. |
| Source | Typical Alberta Fire Code and Building Code requirements for an 18,000 sf public building |
| Risk if Wrong | Exit sign count is relatively stable (driven by code). Room sign count may vary +/-5 based on final room count from Functional Program. Financial impact is modest (~$575 per 5-sign variance). |
| Confidence | MED |

### ASM-013 — Paint Finish Blend (85/15)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | 85% of wall surface receives standard latex paint (IA-12 at $13/m2), 15% receives epoxy/semi-gloss (IA-13 at $20/m2 for washrooms, kitchen, decon areas). |
| Source | Typical institutional building finish distribution |
| Risk if Wrong | If more areas require washable finish (e.g., all corridors), proportion shifts to 70/30, increasing blended rate to $15.10/m2 (+$683). |
| Confidence | MED |
