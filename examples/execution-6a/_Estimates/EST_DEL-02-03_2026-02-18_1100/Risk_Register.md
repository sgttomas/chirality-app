# Risk Register

## Run: EST_DEL-02-03_2026-02-18_1100

| RiskID | Category | Risk Statement | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Affected Lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-001 | Scope Boundary | Locker room and support space fit-up may be claimed by DEL-02-01 (general interior) during aggregation, resulting in double-counting or gaps at the project level. | MEDIUM | HIGH ($95,060 at risk -- 44.8% of estimate) | Confirm scope ownership with the aggregation agent before combining estimates. The cost ownership rule in the brief assigns these to DEL-02-03. | L-010 through L-032 |
| RSK-002 | Area Uncertainty | Support space areas are assumed, not confirmed. Actual floor plan may differ significantly, especially for locker room (1,200 sf assumed) which drives the largest CBS category. | HIGH | MEDIUM ($15,000 +/- range on locker room lines) | Rerun estimate once DEL-02-01 provides confirmed layout. | L-011 through L-019, L-021 through L-031, L-032 |
| RSK-003 | Allowance Accuracy | 5 ALLOWANCE items ($60,500 total) are based on professional judgment, not competitive pricing. Actual costs could vary +/- 40%. | MEDIUM | MEDIUM ($24,000 +/- range) | Obtain contractor/supplier quotes for compressed air piping, warehouse racking, and shower rough-in before finalizing the project estimate. | L-006, L-008, L-009, L-020, L-032 |
| RSK-004 | Wash Bay Option | If Owner selects optional wash bay (SOW-0500), one PW bay is replaced, reducing bay count from 4 to 3. This reduces bay-area-driven costs by ~25% but adds wash bay conversion costs (separate DEL-05-01 estimate). | LOW | LOW ($13,000 reduction in DEL-02-03) | Track Owner decision; adjust bay count in rerun if selected. | L-001, L-004, L-007 |
| RSK-005 | Missing Scope | Items that could arguably belong to DEL-02-03 but were excluded per cost ownership rules: overhead doors ($80,000), HVAC/ventilation ($44,000+), electrical ($14/sf on 8,400 sf = ~$118,000), bay sumps ($18,000). Total excluded scope: ~$260,000. If cost ownership rules change, this estimate would increase significantly. | LOW | HIGH (potential 2x increase) | Cost ownership rules are set by the brief; changes require re-brief. | N/A |
