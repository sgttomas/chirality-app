## Run: EST_DEL-02-03_2026-02-18_1100

| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | Affected Lines | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-RUN-001 | DEL-02-03 includes bay floor finish (densifier + sealer) but excludes structural slab (concrete placement, reinforcement, formwork). Structural slab is allocated to DEL-02-04. | Cost ownership rule: bay-specific fit-up is DEL-02-03; structure is DEL-02-04. IA-08 (sealed concrete) represents finish only, not structural placement. SC-04 (200mm reinforced slab) would be the structural item and belongs to DEL-02-04. | L-001, L-002, L-003 | Requires human validation; potential overlap risk. |
| DEC-RUN-002 | DEL-02-03 includes locker room and support space fit-up as bay-specific scope, not DEL-02-01 general interior. | Brief explicitly states: "PW bay functional fit-up (workshop equip, PPE lockers, storage) -> DEL-02-03" and "bay-specific fit-up IS in DEL-02-03". Locker room, PPE room, office, and washroom serve the PW shop function directly. | L-010 through L-032 | Locker room is 44.8% of total; scope boundary is the highest-impact decision in this estimate. |
| DEC-RUN-003 | ALLOWANCE method used for 5 items where no rate table entry exists. | FALLBACK_POLICY=ALLOW_ALLOWANCE permits this. Items are: compressed air piping (L-006), workshop equipment (L-008), warehouse racking (L-009), PPE room fit-up (L-020), shower rough-in (L-032). | L-006, L-008, L-009, L-020, L-032 | Total ALLOWANCE value: $60,500 (28.5% of estimate). |
| DEC-RUN-004 | Bay wall paint (L-007) included as bay-specific fit-up in DEL-02-03. | Epoxy paint on bay walls is a functional fit-up finish driven by the PW operations requirement for washable surfaces. General wall paint for shared areas (corridors, etc.) would be DEL-02-01. | L-007 | |
| DEC-RUN-005 | Overhead doors excluded from DEL-02-03 per cost ownership rule. | Brief states: "Overhead doors -> DEL-02-04 (NOT DEL-02-03)". 4 PW doors at $20,000 each = $80,000 excluded from this estimate. | N/A (excluded) | These costs appear in DEL-02-04 estimate. |
| DEC-RUN-006 | HVAC, ventilation, bay sumps, and water fill stations excluded per cost ownership rule. | Brief states: "HVAC/ventilation -> DEL-02-05 (NOT DEL-02-03)". MS-07 ($11,000/bay x 4 = $44,000), EQ-10 ($4,500 x 4 = $18,000), EQ-09 ($3,500 x 1) excluded. | N/A (excluded) | These costs appear in DEL-02-05 estimate. |
| DEC-RUN-007 | Electrical power distribution, lighting, and IT excluded per cost ownership rule. | Brief states: "Electrical, lighting -> DEL-02-06 (NOT DEL-02-03)". ES-02 ($14/sf), ES-04 ($6/sf) for bay areas excluded. | N/A (excluded) | These costs appear in DEL-02-06 estimate. |
| DEC-RUN-008 | Used RecommendedRate (midpoint) from all rate tables rather than RateMin or RateMax. | Standard practice for RATE_TABLE basis; RecommendedRate represents the best-estimate within the range. Deviations would be handled via risk analysis, not by choosing min/max. | All RATE_TABLE lines | |
| DEC-RUN-009 | Rounding applied at DOLLAR level to all amounts. | Per brief ROUNDING=DOLLAR. Individual line amounts are rounded to nearest dollar after Qty x UnitRate calculation. | All lines | Minor rounding adjustments (< $1 per line). |
