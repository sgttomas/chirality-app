| AssumptionID | Category | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong | Affected Lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Area | PW shop bay area assumed at 2,100 sf per bay (midpoint of 2,000-2,200 sf range from Datasheet). | Datasheet.md: "Approximate bay size range: 2,000-2,200 ft2 per bay" sourced from Addendum 03 table | +/- 5% on bay-area-driven lines (L-001, L-004, L-007); ~$2,500 sensitivity | L-001, L-004, L-007 |
| ASM-002 | Area | Total PW shop bay area = 4 bays x 2,100 sf = 8,400 sf (780 m2). | PP-12 confirms 4 PW bays; ASM-001 provides per-bay area | See ASM-001 | L-001, L-004, L-007 |
| ASM-003 | Area | Workshop/welding area assumed at 800 sf (74 m2). | Professional judgment based on SOW-0212 requirements (welding bench, drill press, workbench, storage). No confirmed dimension in functional program. Functional Program Rows 27-28 describe function but not area. | +/- 25% possible; $1,000 sensitivity on floor finish | L-002, L-005, L-008 |
| ASM-004 | Area | Warehouse/parts storage area assumed at 600 sf (56 m2). | Professional judgment based on SOW-0212 requirements. Functional Program Row 23.0 describes function but not area. | +/- 30% possible; $600 sensitivity on floor finish, $4,000 sensitivity on racking | L-003, L-009 |
| ASM-005 | Area | PPE/locker room area assumed at 1,200 sf (111 m2). | 40 lockers (per PP-16) requiring ~15 sf per locker = 600 sf locker area + 300 sf shower/change area + 300 sf circulation. Total 1,200 sf. | +/- 20% possible; ~$15,000 sensitivity across locker room lines | L-011 through L-019, L-032 |
| ASM-006 | Area | Shop office area assumed at 200 sf (19 m2). | Single duty office per SOW-0210; typical for shared office with phone/computer/internet per Functional Program Row 25.0. | +/- 25% possible; ~$650 sensitivity | L-021, L-022, L-023 |
| ASM-007 | Area | Shop washroom area assumed at 100 sf (9 m2). | Single accessible washroom per SOW-0210 and ABC requirements; Functional Program Row 26.0. | +/- 20% possible; ~$1,200 sensitivity | L-024 through L-031 |
| ASM-008 | Cost | Compressed air piping allowance of $15,000 for hard-plumbed air lines through 4 PW bays. | No rate table entry available. Allowance based on professional judgment for shop-grade compressed air distribution (compressor is separate scope under DEL-02-05 coordination). Functional Program Rows 27-28 confirm requirement. | +/- 40% possible ($6,000 sensitivity). Obtain mechanical contractor quote for refinement. | L-006 |
| ASM-009 | Cost | Warehouse shelving/racking allowance of $12,000. | No rate table entry available. Allowance based on professional judgment for industrial pallet racking and shelving suitable for PW parts storage. | +/- 50% possible ($6,000 sensitivity). Depends on actual storage requirements and racking configuration. | L-009 |
| ASM-010 | Cost | PPE/first aid room fit-up allowance of $3,500. | No rate table entry available. Covers first aid equipment, PPE storage cabinetry, food washing area, and basic fit-up for 100-150 sf room. | +/- 40% possible ($1,400 sensitivity). | L-020 |
| ASM-011 | Cost | Shower rough-in allowance of $8,000 for 2 standalone showers. | No rate table entry available. Covers shower valves, drains, waterproofing membrane, tile surround rough-in for 2 showers per Functional Program Row 22.0. Plumbing piping distribution is DEL-02-05 scope. | +/- 35% possible ($2,800 sensitivity). | L-032 |
| ASM-012 | Quantity | Bay wall area estimated at 320 m2 total across 4 bays. | Based on 4 bays with approximate perimeter of 200 lf total and average wall height of ~5.3m (17.5 ft), minus door and opening areas. | +/- 20% possible; $1,300 sensitivity | L-007 |
| ASM-013 | Quantity | Locker room wall area estimated at 180 m2. | Based on 1,200 sf room with perimeter ~140 lf and average wall height ~3m (10 ft). | +/- 15% possible; $540 sensitivity | L-015 |
| ASM-014 | Quantity | 4 toilet stalls in locker room (2 per washroom x 2 washrooms). | Functional Program Row 22.0 specifies "2 bathrooms/change rooms". Assumed 2 stalls per washroom to meet code minimums for 40 users. | Minimal cost impact if stall count changes (+/- $1,500 per stall) | L-017 |
| ASM-015 | Quantity | Vanity countertop length: 3 lm in locker room (across 2 washrooms) and 1 lm in shop washroom. | Professional judgment based on number of sinks expected for code compliance. | Minimal cost impact (+/- $575 per lm) | L-019, L-031 |
