## Scope Coverage

- **In-scope deliverables:** 1 (DEL-02-06)
- **Line items produced:** 13
- **TBD amounts:** 0
- **Provenance completeness:** 100% (all 13 lines have SourceRef)

## Key Scope Boundaries (from brief cost ownership rules)

**Included in this estimate:**
- Electrical distribution (panels, feeders, branch circuits, receptacles)
- Lighting (fixtures, controls, emergency lighting)
- IT/telecom (cabling, drops, racks, connectivity)
- PA system (equipment + wiring)
- Bay display systems (screens + mounting + connectivity)
- Meeting room 15-workstation infrastructure (power + data)
- Compressed air electrical feed (covered within bay power distribution)
- Normal power distribution to generator transfer point
- Electrical service point for yard lighting (panel/breaker space; included in service entrance)
- IT network infrastructure that access control connects to (included in IT backbone)
- Electrical engineering design fees
- System-specific commissioning labor (electrical testing)

**Excluded from this estimate (owned by other deliverables):**
- Generator, ATS, fuel tank, generator pad, exhaust (DEL-02-07)
- Overhead door backup power mechanism (DEL-02-07)
- Yard lighting poles/fixtures/wiring (DEL-05-02)
- Access control system (DEL-05-03)
- Camera system (DEL-05-04)
- Mechanical equipment (DEL-02-05)
- Appliance installation electrical connections (DEL-05-06)
- Fire alarm system (note: ES-08 rate exists but fire alarm is not listed in DEL-02-06 scope items; see DEC-RC-02)

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers** preventing meaningful estimate production.
- **ASM-001:** Bay vs. institutional area split (12,800 sf / 5,200 sf) is an assumption; actual split depends on architectural layout from DEL-02-01.
- **ASM-002:** Commissioning labor hours (100 hr) is an assumption; actual hours depend on system complexity and commissioning plan from DEL-01-07.
- **DEC-RC-02:** Fire alarm system (ES-08) is not included. The decomposition does not map fire alarm to DEL-02-06 scope items. If fire alarm is intended for DEL-02-06, add ES-08 at 18,000 sf x $3.50/sf = $63,000.
