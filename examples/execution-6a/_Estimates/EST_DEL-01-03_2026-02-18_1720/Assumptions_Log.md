## Assumptions

### ASM-EST-001: Safety Officer hours are sufficient for scope

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| AssumptionID | ASM-EST-001 |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |
| Statement | The 60 hours allocated to Safety Officer (R-20) in Level_of_Effort.csv are assumed sufficient to cover H&S plan development (20h) and site safety management during active construction (~2.5h/wk x 16 weeks). |
| Source | Level_of_Effort.csv, Notes column for DEL-01-03 R-20 |
| Risk if Wrong | If construction is more complex or longer than assumed (PP-01 = 18 months, with 16 weeks of active safety oversight), hours may be understated. |
| Confidence | MED |

### ASM-EST-002: Administrative support hours are sufficient

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| AssumptionID | ASM-EST-002 |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |
| Statement | The 8 hours allocated to Administrative / Document Control (R-24) are assumed sufficient for safety documentation filing throughout the project. |
| Source | Level_of_Effort.csv, Notes column for DEL-01-03 R-24 |
| Risk if Wrong | If regulatory documentation requirements are more intensive than assumed, hours may be understated. |
| Confidence | MED |

### ASM-EST-003: Hourly rates are representative of market

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| AssumptionID | ASM-EST-003 |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |
| Statement | The hourly rates in Professional_Staff_Rates.csv (R-20 = $110/hr, R-24 = $80/hr) are assumed to be representative of current market rates for Alberta-based professional staff. |
| Source | Professional_Staff_Rates.csv, Basis column = MARKET, Confidence = MEDIUM |
| Risk if Wrong | If actual rates differ (e.g., due to remote site premium, market escalation, or specific firm pricing), the estimate will be under- or overstated proportionally. |
| Confidence | MED |

### ASM-EST-004: Training and PPE/signage costs are non-zero

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| AssumptionID | ASM-EST-004 |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |
| Statement | Training costs and PPE/signage supplies are assumed to be real, non-zero cost drivers for this deliverable, but their magnitude is unknown without a pricing source. |
| Source | Brief: "Cost Drivers: Safety officer hours; training costs; PPE/signage supplies" |
| Risk if Wrong | If training and PPE costs are negligible or covered elsewhere (e.g., included in subcontractor pricing), the TBD lines may be unnecessary. |
| Confidence | LOW |

### ASM-EST-005: No subcontractor involvement in H&S plan preparation

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| AssumptionID | ASM-EST-005 |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |
| Statement | The H&S plan is assumed to be prepared entirely by in-house staff (Safety Officer + Admin). No external safety consultant or third-party training provider costs are included. |
| Source | Level_of_Effort.csv (only R-20 and R-24 listed for DEL-01-03); no subcontractor or external consultant line items |
| Risk if Wrong | If a third-party safety consultant is required (e.g., for specialized hazard assessments), costs would increase. |
| Confidence | MED |
