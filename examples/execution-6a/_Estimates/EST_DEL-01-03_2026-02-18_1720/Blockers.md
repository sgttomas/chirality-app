## Pricing Source Gaps (Not Blockers, But Gaps)

These are not blockers (the run completes with WARNINGS status) but are the primary gaps preventing a fully priced estimate:

| Gap | Affected Line | Resolution Path |
|---|---|---|
| No training cost source | L-0103-003 (CBS-TRAINING) | Provide a rate table or quote for site orientation/training costs |
| No PPE/signage supply source | L-0103-004 (CBS-SUPPLIES) | Provide a rate table or quote for PPE quantities and unit costs |
