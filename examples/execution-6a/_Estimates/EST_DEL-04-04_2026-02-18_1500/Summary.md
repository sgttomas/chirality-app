# Estimate Summary -- DEL-04-04 Cold Storage -- Electrical & Ventilation

**Snapshot:** EST_DEL-04-04_2026-02-18_1500
**Basis of Estimate:** RATE_TABLE
**Currency:** CAD
**Rounding:** DOLLAR

---

## Totals

| CBS | Description | Amount (CAD) |
|---|---|---|
| 26-ELEC | Basic electrical -- panel, receptacles, lighting, door opener feeds | $36,000 |
| 23-VENT | Ventilation -- condensation/icing prevention | $18,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **DEL-04-04 Total** | **$54,000** |

## Basis of Estimate Used

- **Method:** RATE_TABLE (all line items)
- **Primary rates:** ES-12 ($6/sf electrical) and MS-13 ($3/sf ventilation) from project rate tables
- **Area basis:** 6,000 sf (PP-07; confirmed; HIGH confidence)
- **Mixed methods:** None (100% RATE_TABLE; consistent with ALLOW_MIXED_METHODS=FALSE)

## By Package / Deliverable

| PackageID | DeliverableID | Amount (CAD) | Line Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| PKG-004 | DEL-04-04 | $54,000 | 2 |

## Cross-Check (informational)

The parametric cross-check using PB-01 and PB-02 yields a $16/sf delta for all non-shell scope (foundation + floor + doors + electrical + ventilation). This estimate contributes $9/sf ($54,000 / 6,000 sf) for electrical + ventilation, leaving $7/sf for foundation, floor, and doors in DEL-04-02 and DEL-04-03. This is directionally consistent.

## Scope Ownership Confirmed

| Scope Area | Included in DEL-04-04 | NOT in DEL-04-04 |
|---|---|---|
| Basic lighting (fixtures, controls) | Yes | DEL-04-01 |
| Basic power/receptacles | Yes | DEL-04-01 |
| Ventilation/air circulation (condensation prevention) | Yes | DEL-04-01 |
| Door opener electrical feeds (2 overhead doors) | Yes | DEL-04-02 |
| Utility service ENTRY into cold storage building | Yes (included in ES-12 panel/distribution rate) | DEL-03-04 |
| Electrical panel for cold storage | Yes (included in ES-12 rate) | DEL-02-06 |

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- No unresolved blockers preventing estimating at this stage.
- All line items are priced with rate table evidence; no TBDs.
- Provenance completeness: 100% (2/2 lines with explicit SourceRef).
- Ventilation approach (ridge vents / gable fans) is assumed passive/low-energy per MS-13 description. If active mechanical ventilation is required based on climate data analysis (DEP-04-04-007), costs could increase.
