| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-0404-01 | Cold storage building footprint is 6,000 sf (60 ft x 100 ft). | PP-07 (confirmed, HIGH confidence); Decomposition DEC-001. | Direct linear impact on total: each 1,000 sf change = ~$9,000 change in total. |
| ASM-0404-02 | Ventilation system is passive/low-energy (ridge vents, gable fans, or similar) as described in MS-13. NOT heated ventilation. | Brief specifies "condensation/icing prevention"; OSR 11.1.2 specifies ventilation/air circulation. MS-13 description: "Ridge vents or gable fans; minimal mechanical." | If active mechanical ventilation is required (e.g., powered exhaust fans with controls), costs could increase by $12,000-$30,000. |
| ASM-0404-03 | Two (2) overhead door openers require electrical feeds, as specified by PP-14 and the brief. | PP-14 (confirmed, HIGH confidence); SOW-0302 specifies motorized openers. | If additional motorized openings are added, minor incremental cost (~$500-$1,000 per additional opener feed). |
| ASM-0404-04 | ES-12 rate is inclusive of all in-building electrical distribution from service entry point to end devices (panel, branch circuits, receptacles, lighting fixtures, door opener circuits). | ES-12 description: "Panel; receptacles; lighting; door opener feeds; minimal." | If significant additional electrical loads are identified (e.g., heating, compressed air, security), they would be outside this rate and need separate pricing. |
| ASM-0404-05 | No fire alarm system is required in the cold storage building. | Cold storage is an unheated ancillary building (Group F, Division 3 occupancy likely). ES-12 does not include fire alarm. Fire alarm (ES-08) is typically required in institutional/assembly occupancies but may not be required for unheated storage per AHJ. | If AHJ requires fire alarm, add approximately ES-08 rate ($3.50/sf x 6,000 sf = $21,000). |
| ASM-0404-06 | No emergency lighting is required in the cold storage building beyond what is included in the ES-12 basic lighting rate. | Unheated storage building with minimal occupancy. If code requires emergency/exit lighting, the cost is minor. | If required: approximately 4-6 units at ~$200-$400 each = $800-$2,400 incremental. Likely negligible. |
