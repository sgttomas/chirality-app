| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-EST-0404-01 | Use ES-12 ($6/sf) as the comprehensive cold storage electrical rate covering panel, receptacles, lighting, and door opener feeds. Do NOT separately add ES-05 ($4/sf lighting-only). | ES-12 description explicitly states "Panel; receptacles; lighting; door opener feeds; minimal." Adding ES-05 on top would double-count the lighting component. ES-12 at $6/sf compared to ES-05 at $4/sf (lighting only) implies ~$2/sf for non-lighting electrical, which is reasonable for a minimal cold storage installation. | Avoids double-counting. Total electrical = $36,000 vs $60,000 if both were applied. |
| DEC-EST-0404-02 | Use MS-13 ($3/sf) for ventilation scope. Treat ventilation as a separate CBS (23-VENT) from electrical (26-ELEC). | MS-13 is a mechanical discipline rate (condensation prevention ventilation) that is distinct from the electrical scope in ES-12. Separate CBS codes maintain discipline-level traceability. | Clean CBS separation; total ventilation = $18,000. |
| DEC-EST-0404-03 | Assume utility service entry (from building wall to panel) is included within ES-12 rate. Do not price a separate feeder line item. | ES-12 description includes "Panel" and the rate is for a complete basic cold storage electrical system. The service entry from the building wall to the panel is a short run that would reasonably be included in this rate. Site service TO the building is DEL-03-04 scope. | No separate feeder line item; avoids overlap with DEL-03-04. |
| DEC-EST-0404-04 | Use PP-07 area (6,000 sf) as the area basis for both electrical and ventilation rates. | PP-07 is confirmed at HIGH confidence (60 ft x 100 ft per DEC-001 in decomposition). The entire building footprint is the appropriate area basis for area-based electrical and ventilation rates. | 6,000 sf applied to both lines. |
| DEC-EST-0404-05 | Use recommended rates (not min or max) from rate tables. | Recommended rates represent the mid-point of the range and are the default for rate table basis. The full range is documented in the QA Report sensitivity analysis. | Recommended rates used: ES-12 = $6/sf, MS-13 = $3/sf. |
