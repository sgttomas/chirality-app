Carried forward unchanged from prior run.

### ASM-003 — Staff Rates Are Blended/Market Rates

## Updated Assumptions

### ASM-004 — Software/Tools Cost (UPDATED — was "may be immaterial")

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Scheduling software/tools cost estimated at $3,500 CAD as a parametric allowance for an 18-month project. Based on typical P6 Cloud or MS Project Online licensing. |
| Source | Parametric estimate; no vendor quote or rate table |
| Impact | If software is already licensed as part of DB overhead, this $3,500 may be double-counted. If a more expensive enterprise tool is required, cost could be higher ($5,000-10,000). |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Change from Prior | Prior run left this as TBD with the note that it "may be immaterial or absorbed in overhead." This revision assigns a parametric value per human authorization. |
