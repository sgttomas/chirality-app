## Key Warnings

1. **L-003 is a parametric allowance (LOW confidence).** The $3,500 software/tools estimate is based on typical P6/MS Project licensing for an 18-month project. Actual cost may vary depending on the Design-Builder's existing software arrangements. If software is already licensed as overhead, this line may be removed or reduced.

2. **LOE quantities are assumption-based.** The Level_of_Effort.csv declares hours with Basis=PARAMETRIC. These are professional judgment estimates, not contractual commitments. Confidence is MEDIUM.

3. **Mixed methods now present.** L-001 and L-002 are RATE_TABLE; L-003 is ALLOWANCE. This was authorized by the human for TBD resolution purposes.
