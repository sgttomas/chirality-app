# Blockers Report — EST_DEL-04-01_2026-02-18_1200

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Hard estimating blockers | 0 |
| Design-phase prerequisites (informational, not pricing blockers) | 4 |
| Downstream handovers (informational) | 4 |

## Hard Estimating Blockers

None. All pricing for DEL-04-01 is supported by the PB-01 parametric model and the confirmed building area (6,000 sf per DEC-001/PP-07).

## Design-Phase Prerequisites (Not Pricing Blockers)

These are upstream information needs that affect design work but do not prevent parametric estimating at this stage:

| DependencyID | From | Target | Statement | Impact on Estimating |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-04-01-E001 | DEL-04-01 | DEL-02-04 (PKG-002) | Main building door/window profile required for aesthetic coordination | None -- parametric shell rate is independent of aesthetic details |
| DEP-04-01-E002 | DEL-04-01 | Geotech Report (RFP Appendix D) | Geotechnical investigation report needed for foundation/structural selection | None for DEL-04-01 (foundation is DEL-04-03 scope) |
| DEP-04-01-E003 | DEL-04-01 | DEL-03-01 (PKG-003) | Site grading drawings for cold storage building placement | None -- parametric shell rate is independent of exact placement |
| DEP-04-01-E004 | DEL-04-01 | PW Equipment List (Functional Program) | Equipment list for minimum clear height verification | None -- parametric shell rate includes standard PEMB height; height refinement would not materially change shell cost |

## Downstream Handovers (Informational)

| DependencyID | From DEL-04-01 | To | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-04-01-E005 | Configuration basis | DEL-04-02 (Doors/Openings) | DEL-04-01 establishes openings configuration that DEL-04-02 builds upon |
| DEP-04-01-E006 | Configuration basis | DEL-04-03 (Floor/Foundation) | DEL-04-01 provides building configuration for DEL-04-03 foundation design |
| DEP-04-01-E007 | Configuration basis | DEL-04-04 (Electrical/Ventilation) | DEL-04-01 provides ventilation path basis for DEL-04-04 |
| DEP-04-01-E009 | Design drawings | DEL-01-04 (Permitting) | Cold storage drawings required for permit submission |
