## Risks

| RiskID | Category | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-001 | Market | PEMB manufacturer pricing may differ from parametric rate ($32/sf) due to steel market volatility, lead times, or regional supply constraints. | MEDIUM | MEDIUM ($24,000 variance at range endpoints: $168K to $210K) | Obtain actual PEMB quotes during proposal phase. PB-01 range ($28-35/sf) provides bounds. | ASM-002; ASM-005 |
| RISK-002 | Scope | PB-01 parametric rate may exclude minor shell components (e.g., specialized flashing, snow guards, fall protection anchors) that could be required for code compliance. | LOW | LOW (estimated $2,000-$8,000 for add-on items) | Review PB-01 inclusions against detailed PEMB specification during design. | ASM-004 |
| RISK-003 | Design | Design engineering allowance ($10,000) may be insufficient if cold storage configuration requires more coordination effort than typical (e.g., complex aesthetic integration, specialized structural analysis). | LOW | LOW ($5,000-$10,000 additional) | Refine design fee estimate once DB team composition and effort estimate are available. | ASM-003 |
