# Risk Register -- EST_DEL-05-03_2026-02-18_1700

## Identified Risks

| RiskID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-001 | Actual zone count exceeds 10 once DEL-02-01 floor plan is finalized | MEDIUM | Each additional zone adds ~$3,200 (range $2,500-$4,000 per OPT-07). 5 extra zones = ~$16,000 increase. | Re-run estimate with confirmed zone count once DEL-02-01 is available. Carry OPT-07 per-zone rate for sensitivity analysis. | PP-28 (LOW confidence); DEP-05-03-003 |
| RSK-002 | Parametric pricing significantly understates or overstates actual vendor quote | MEDIUM | OPT-06 range is $35,000-$55,000 (57% spread). Vendor quote could fall outside this range. | Replace with vendor quote as soon as available. Flag to Owner that this is a placeholder estimate. | OPT-06 (LOW confidence) |
| RSK-003 | Scope boundary disputes at interface with DEL-02-06 (electrical/IT) | LOW | Conduit, low-voltage power, or network costs may be double-counted or missed between deliverables if interface is not clearly coordinated. | Enforce cost ownership rules from brief. Coordinate with DEL-02-06 estimate during aggregation. | DEP-05-03-004; Brief cost ownership rules |
| RSK-004 | Owner elects both access control (DEL-05-03) and security cameras (DEL-05-04), requiring integration | LOW | Integration costs (shared head-end, software, wiring synergies) are not priced. Could be a cost savings or additional cost depending on system selection. | If both options are elected, re-scope for integration opportunities per Guidance.md. | DEP-05-03-005 |
