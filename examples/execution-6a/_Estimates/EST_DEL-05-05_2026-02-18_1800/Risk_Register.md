| RSK-EST-003 | Illumination decision deferred too late in design, creating rework or coordination gaps with DEL-02-06 electrical scope | LOW | MEDIUM -- late decision could require electrical re-routing or panel capacity changes | Flag illumination decision as an early Owner decision point; coordinate with DEL-02-06 scope owner | DEC-EST-002; DEP-05-05-006 |
| RSK-EST-004 | Double-counting or gap between DEL-05-05 signage scope and DEL-02-01/DEL-02-04/DEL-02-06 base scope | LOW | LOW -- cost ownership boundaries are explicitly defined in brief | Verify boundaries during aggregation/reconciliation pass | DEC-EST-004; DEC-EST-005 |
