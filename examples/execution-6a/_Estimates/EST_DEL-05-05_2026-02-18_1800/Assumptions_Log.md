# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-05-05_2026-02-18_1800

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Basis | Risk if Wrong | Resolution Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-EST-001 | Town branding signage scope is limited to exterior main building signage only (no cold storage, no interior branding) | SOW-0504 states "main building exterior"; Decomposition Scope Ledger confirms SOW-0504 maps to DEL-05-05 | If signage is required on cold storage or interior, additional line items and cost would be needed | Confirm with Owner when branding guidelines are received |
| ASM-EST-002 | Quantity assumed as 1 sign unit | Minimum reasonable assumption absent branding guidelines; OPT-10/OPT-11 price per unit | If multiple signs required (e.g., 2 facades), cost scales linearly ($12,000 to $24,000 non-illuminated; $22,000 to $44,000 illuminated) | Confirm sign quantity/locations when branding guidelines and building exterior concept are available |
| ASM-EST-003 | OPT-10/OPT-11 unit rates include supply, fabrication, mounting hardware, and installation labour | Optional_Items_Pricing.csv descriptions state "fabricated" and "structural mount" within unit pricing | If installation is priced separately or requires specialty subcontractor, an additional line item may be needed | Confirm with vendor quote when available |
| ASM-EST-004 | Sign dimensions and materials are within the parametric range assumed by OPT-10/OPT-11 | Source notes: "aluminum + vinyl or dimensional letters" for OPT-10; "same + LED backlighting or halo illumination" for OPT-11 | If Town branding requires premium materials (e.g., bronze, stainless steel, channel letters with individual LED) or very large dimensions, costs could exceed the parametric high range | Reprice with vendor quote after branding guidelines are received |
| ASM-EST-005 | Electrical circuit cost for illuminated signage is carried by DEL-02-06, not DEL-05-05 | Brief Cost Ownership Rules (explicit) | If DEL-02-06 does not carry this cost, it would be unpriced (gap) | Verify during aggregation/reconciliation |
