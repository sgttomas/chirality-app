# Decision Log -- EST_DEL-05-05_2026-02-18_1800

| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-EST-001 | Fallback from QUOTE to ALLOWANCE method for all line items | No vendor quote exists for branding signage; Town branding guidelines are PENDING (DEP-05-05-007). FALLBACK_POLICY=ALLOW_ALLOWANCE permits this. Parametric data from Optional_Items_Pricing.csv (OPT-10, OPT-11) used as allowance-grade pricing. | All line items carry Method=ALLOWANCE and Confidence=LOW. Repricing required when quotes are obtained. |
| DEC-EST-002 | Carry two mutually exclusive scenarios (non-illuminated and illuminated) | Illumination decision is TBD per brief and source data. Rather than picking one or averaging, both scenarios are priced separately so the Owner can see the cost impact of the decision. | Primary total uses non-illuminated ($12,000); alternate total uses illuminated ($22,000). Not additive. |
| DEC-EST-003 | Assume quantity = 1 sign for both scenarios | Optional_Items_Pricing.csv prices signage per unit. No information on required number of signs is available without branding guidelines. 1 unit is the minimum reasonable assumption. | If multiple signs are required, multiply the unit rate. Flagged in Assumptions_Log.md (ASM-EST-002). |
| DEC-EST-004 | Exclude electrical circuit cost for illuminated signage from DEL-05-05 | Per brief Cost Ownership Rules, the electrical circuit for illuminated signage is owned by DEL-02-06. The OPT-11 unit rate includes the sign-side electrical connection but not the branch circuit from the panel. | Prevents double-counting between DEL-05-05 and DEL-02-06. |
| DEC-EST-005 | Exclude structural provision cost for sign mounting from DEL-05-05 | Per brief Cost Ownership Rules, structural provisions for signage mounting are owned by DEL-02-04. The OPT-10/OPT-11 unit rates include the sign mounting hardware but not base-building structural reinforcement. | Prevents double-counting between DEL-05-05 and DEL-02-04. |
| DEC-EST-006 | CBS code 09-SIGNAGE-FAB assigned deterministically | No CBSHint available in decomposition. CBS code assigned per Run_Context.md mapping rule. | CBS code is snapshot-internal; reconcile during aggregation. |
