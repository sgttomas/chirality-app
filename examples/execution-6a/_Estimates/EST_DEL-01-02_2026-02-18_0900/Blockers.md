# Blockers Report — EST_DEL-01-02_2026-02-18_0900

## Summary

No hard blockers to estimating were identified for DEL-01-02. All priced line items have sufficient basis evidence from the provided rate table and level-of-effort sources. One cost driver (software/tools) lacks pricing evidence but is classified as a **gap**, not a **blocker**, because it does not prevent meaningful totals from being produced.

## Dependency Evidence Review

The following dependencies were extracted from DEL-01-02/Dependencies.csv. They are assessed for **estimate-readiness impact** only (not for schedule or execution readiness).

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Estimate Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-0102-001 | PKG-001 (parent package) | ANCHOR | None — structural relationship only |
| DEP-0102-002 | SOW-0007 | ANCHOR | None — traceability link |
| DEP-0102-003 | SOW-0602 | ANCHOR | None — traceability link |
| DEP-0102-004 | OBJ-008 | ANCHOR | None — traceability link |
| DEP-0102-005 | DEL-01-01 (scope confirmation) | PREREQUISITE | **Low** — scope confirmation affects schedule content, not pricing for scheduling labour |
| DEP-0102-006 | DEL-01-06 (site logistics plan) | PREREQUISITE | **Low** — logistics plan affects schedule content, not pricing for scheduling labour |
| DEP-0102-007 | DEL-01-04 (permitting timeline) | PREREQUISITE | **Low** — permitting timeline affects schedule content, not pricing for scheduling labour |
| DEP-0102-008 | DEL-01-05 (change orders) | INTERFACE | **None** — ongoing interface during execution, not an input to the estimate |
| DEP-0102-009 | CCDC 14-2013 Appendix J | PREREQUISITE | **None** — contract document needed for schedule provisions, not for pricing |

## Conclusion

All dependencies relate to **schedule content readiness** (what goes into the schedule), not to **pricing readiness** (what determines the cost of producing the schedule). The estimate can proceed without resolution of these dependencies.
