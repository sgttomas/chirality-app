## Key Warnings

1. **Software/tools cost driver has no pricing source.** The brief identifies "software/tools" as a cost driver for DEL-01-02, but no rate table, quote, or allowance was provided. Under STRICT fallback, this line is TBD. To resolve: provide a software licensing cost or allowance in PRICE_SOURCES.

2. **LOE quantities are assumption-based.** The `Level_of_Effort.csv` declares hours with `Basis=PARAMETRIC`. These are professional judgment estimates, not contractual commitments. Confidence is MEDIUM.

3. **No scheduling software disbursement included.** If the Design-Builder uses proprietary scheduling software (e.g., MS Project, Primavera), the license cost is not captured. This may be immaterial if absorbed in overhead, or material if a separate tool purchase is required.

## Blockers (from Dependency Evidence)

No hard blockers to estimating were identified. The dependency register shows upstream prerequisites (DEL-01-01, DEL-01-04, DEL-01-06) and an interface (DEL-01-05) but these relate to **schedule content readiness**, not to pricing inputs. The CCDC 14-2013 Supplementary Conditions (Appendix J) location is TBD in the dependency register but does not affect pricing for this deliverable.
