## Dependency Review (from Dependencies.csv -- 14 rows)

### Upstream Dependencies Assessed for Estimate Impact

| DependencyID | Target | Type | Blocks Estimating? | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-01-07-007 | DEL-01-04 Permitting & AHJ | PREREQUISITE | NO | Execution dependency; does not affect ability to price Cx coordination labor |
| DEP-01-07-008 | DEL-01-01 Design Management | PREREQUISITE | NO | System scope identification informs Cx plan content, not Cx coordination pricing |
| DEP-01-07-009 | RFP 2024_004 | CONSTRAINT | NO | RFP is available and governs requirements; already reflected in deliverable docs |
| DEP-01-07-010 | PKG-002 design outputs | INTERFACE | NO | As-built inputs are execution-phase; does not block pricing of coordination hours |
| DEP-01-07-011 | PKG-003 civil/site outputs | INTERFACE | NO | Same as above -- execution-phase interface |
| DEP-01-07-012 | Vendors/manufacturers | INTERFACE | NO | External data collection is execution-phase; does not block pricing |
| DEP-01-07-014 | CCDC 14-2013 | CONSTRAINT | NO | Contract form constrains process, not pricing of coordination labor |

### Notes

- All 7 upstream execution dependencies are relevant to the execution sequence but do not gate the ability to estimate DEL-01-07 using rate-table inputs.
- The 1 downstream dependency (DEP-01-07-013, Payment Certifier) is informational only for estimating purposes.
- The 6 anchor edges are traceability records (not blockers).
