## Basis of Estimate Used

**RATE_TABLE**: Unit rates derived from Professional_Staff_Rates.csv; quantities (hours) derived from Level_of_Effort.csv. Both sources are classified as MARKET-based with MEDIUM confidence. All line items use Method=RATE_TABLE with no fallbacks required.

## Cost Ownership Boundary

DEL-01-07 covers OVERALL commissioning coordination and closeout administration ONLY. This includes:
- Cx plan development and functional testing coordination
- Training delivery to Owner staff
- As-built drawing coordination and O&M manual assembly
- Deficiency management and warranty administration
- Legal/as-built survey coordination

System-specific commissioning labor (mechanical balancing, electrical testing, controls commissioning, etc.) is carried in the respective PKG-002 discipline deliverables and is NOT included in this estimate.

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers identified.** All pricing inputs (rates and hours) are available from PRICE_SOURCES.
- **Confidence: MEDIUM** across all line items. Rates are MARKET-basis estimates; hours are PARAMETRIC-basis assumptions from Level_of_Effort.csv.
- **Cost ownership note:** Reviewer should confirm that system-specific commissioning costs are included in PKG-002 estimates to avoid either double-counting or gaps.
- **Legal survey cost:** The as-built legal/topographical survey (SOW-0113) is coordinated under DEL-01-07 but the survey cost itself (external surveyor fee) is not captured in this rate-table-based estimate. If survey is to be priced, a quote or allowance line would be needed.
