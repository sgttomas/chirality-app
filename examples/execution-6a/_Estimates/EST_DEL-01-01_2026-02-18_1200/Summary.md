## Cost Ownership Note

All costs in this estimate represent project-level management and coordination for DEL-01-01. Discipline-specific design hours (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil production work) are NOT included here; those costs belong in PKG-002, PKG-003, and PKG-004 discipline deliverables. The Architect (Project) hours (R-04) are for design review/QA-QC cycles -- a management function -- not discipline design production.

## Key Warnings and Blockers

- **No blockers identified.** All 4 line items are fully priced with rate table evidence.
- **No TBD amounts.**
- **Dependency evidence reviewed:** 21 dependency rows (9 ANCHOR, 12 EXECUTION) from Dependencies.csv. All EXECUTION prerequisites are DOCUMENT-type or DELIVERABLE-type upstream inputs. None represent cost blockers for this estimate.
- **Confidence:** MED across all line items. Rates are MARKET-basis with MEDIUM confidence per Professional_Staff_Rates.csv. Hours are PARAMETRIC-basis with MEDIUM confidence per Level_of_Effort.csv notes.
