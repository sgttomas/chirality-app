## New Decisions in This Run

### DEC-EST-005 — Training Costs TBD Resolved as Parametric Allowance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision | L-0103-003 (training costs) resolved from TBD to $4,500 CAD as a parametric allowance. |
| Rationale | Human authorized ORCHESTRATOR to resolve TBDs. Training costs for a 18-month Alberta construction project with 30-40 workers typically include: site orientation sessions ($1,000-2,000), WHMIS certification ($500-1,000), first aid training ($1,000-2,000), and training materials ($500-1,000). $4,500 is a reasonable midpoint. |
| Method | ALLOWANCE |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Prior Decision Superseded | DEC-EST-003 (which set L-0103-003 to TBD under STRICT fallback) |

### DEC-EST-006 — PPE/Signage Supplies TBD Resolved as Parametric Allowance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision | L-0103-004 (PPE/signage supplies) resolved from TBD to $3,500 CAD as a parametric allowance. |
| Rationale | Human authorized ORCHESTRATOR to resolve TBDs. PPE and safety signage for an 18-month project typically includes: hard hats ($25-40 x 20 = $500-800), safety vests ($15-25 x 20 = $300-500), safety glasses ($10-15 x 40 = $400-600), first aid kits ($200-400 x 2 = $400-800), site safety signage ($500-1,500). $3,500 is a reasonable midpoint. |
| Method | ALLOWANCE |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Prior Decision Superseded | DEC-EST-003 (which set L-0103-004 to TBD under STRICT fallback) |

### DEC-EST-007 — Mixed Methods Authorized for TBD Resolution

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision | ALLOW_MIXED_METHODS changed from FALSE to TRUE. L-0103-001/002 remain RATE_TABLE; L-0103-003/004 are ALLOWANCE. |
| Rationale | Human authorized ORCHESTRATOR to resolve TBDs, requiring ALLOWANCE method for items without rate table evidence. |
