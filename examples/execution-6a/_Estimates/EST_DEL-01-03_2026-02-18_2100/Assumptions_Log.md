## Updated Assumptions

### ASM-EST-004 — Training and PPE/Signage Costs (UPDATED — was "non-zero but unknown")

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Training costs estimated at $4,500 and PPE/signage supplies at $3,500, totaling $8,000 in parametric allowances. |
| Source | Parametric estimates based on typical Alberta construction site safety budgets |
| Impact | If training is more intensive (e.g., specialized hazmat certification), costs could be $8,000-15,000. If PPE requirements are minimal (small crew), costs could be $1,500-2,500. |
| Confidence | LOW |
| Change from Prior | Prior run noted costs were "non-zero but unknown." This revision assigns parametric values per human authorization. |

### ASM-EST-006 — Workforce Size for PPE/Training Budget (NEW)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assumption | Workforce size assumed at 30-40 workers over the project duration for PPE and training cost estimation. |
| Source | Typical for $8-12M design-build municipal project in Alberta |
| Impact | If workforce is larger (e.g., 60+ workers during peak), both training and PPE costs increase proportionally. |
| Confidence | LOW |
