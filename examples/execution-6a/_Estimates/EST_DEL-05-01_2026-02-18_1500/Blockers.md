# Blockers Report

## DEL-05-01 -- Option -- Built-in Wash Bay

### Summary

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Total dependencies | 11 |
| Anchor dependencies (traceability) | 2 |
| Execution dependencies | 9 |
| Unresolved blockers (SatisfactionStatus=TBD) | 9 |
| Critical for estimate accuracy | 3 (see below) |

### Critical Blockers (affect estimate accuracy)

#### 1. PW Bay Layout Not Yet Developed (DEP-05-01-E01)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **DependencyID** | DEP-05-01-E01 |
| **Type** | PREREQUISITE |
| **Target** | DEL-02-03 (Public Works Shop Bays, Workshop & Support Spaces) |
| **Statement** | Base building PW bay area layout must be sufficiently developed to establish fourth bay location for wash bay concept |
| **SatisfactionStatus** | TBD |
| **Estimate Impact** | If bay configuration changes, the wash bay system scope and cost could change materially. The current allowance assumes conversion of an existing PW bay slot. |
| **Required Action** | Advance DEL-02-03 bay layout to confirm fourth bay location before finalizing wash bay vendor quote. |

#### 2. Environmental Regulatory Requirements Unresolved (DEP-05-01-E04)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **DependencyID** | DEP-05-01-E04 |
| **Type** | PREREQUISITE |
| **Target** | AEP / Town of Penhold environmental advisor (EXTERNAL) |
| **Statement** | Environmental regulatory requirements must be confirmed with AEP or Town environmental advisor for wash bay effluent management approach |
| **SatisfactionStatus** | TBD |
| **Estimate Impact** | OPT-03 (environmental compliance) has the widest relative range ($8k--$18k, 125% spread). Regulatory outcome could push cost beyond range if closed-loop recycling or holding tank with pump-out is required. |
| **Required Action** | Obtain AEP/Town guidance on effluent treatment requirements before vendor quoting. |

#### 3. Fleet Vehicle Dimensions Not Confirmed (DEP-05-01-E02)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **DependencyID** | DEP-05-01-E02 |
| **Type** | PREREQUISITE |
| **Target** | RFP Appendix B (Public Works Critical Design Equipment List) |
| **Statement** | RFP Appendix B must be reviewed to confirm fleet vehicle dimensions for wash bay sizing |
| **SatisfactionStatus** | TBD |
| **Estimate Impact** | Bay sizing affects equipment selection and system cost. If largest PW vehicles require a wider/taller wash bay, equipment costs could increase. |
| **Required Action** | Review Appendix B vehicle dimensions and confirm wash bay clear dimensions. |

### Other Execution Dependencies (not blocking estimate but affect execution)

| DependencyID | Type | Target | Statement | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-05-01-E03 | INTERFACE | DEL-03-02 (Grading/Stormwater) | Site civil drainage coordination for wash bay effluent tie-ins | TBD |
| DEP-05-01-E05 | INTERFACE | DEL-01-04 (Permitting/AHJ) | AHJ pre-consultation for wash bay plumbing/drainage/building permit | TBD |
| DEP-05-01-E06 | INTERFACE | DEL-02-05 (Mechanical/Plumbing) | Base building mechanical provides bay sumps and interfaces | TBD |
| DEP-05-01-E07 | HANDOVER | DEL-02-05 (Mechanical/Plumbing) | Wash bay HVAC inputs handed to mechanical discipline | TBD |
| DEP-05-01-E08 | INTERFACE | DEL-03-04 (Site Utilities) | Water supply and wastewater disposal connect to site utility stubs | TBD |
