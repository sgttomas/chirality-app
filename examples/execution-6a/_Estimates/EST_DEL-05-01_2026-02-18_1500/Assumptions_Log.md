## Estimate-Run Assumptions

| AssumptionID | Date | Assumption | Impact if Wrong | AffectedItems | SourceRef |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-EST-001 | 2026-02-18 | Wash bay replaces one of four PW shop bays (fourth bay converted). | If wash bay does not replace a PW bay but is instead an addition, structural/envelope costs would increase significantly beyond the OPT-01 allowance. | L-05-01-001 | SOW-0500 ("potentially replacing a Public Works bay"); DEP-05-01-E01 |
| ASM-EST-002 | 2026-02-18 | Base building mechanical rough-in to the wash bay location (hot water, cold water, drainage stubs) is provided by DEL-02-05 at no additional cost to this option. | If base rough-in is not provided, OPT-02 plumbing cost would increase. | L-05-01-002 | Brief Cost Ownership Rules; DEP-05-01-E06 |
| ASM-EST-003 | 2026-02-18 | Base building bay sumps (one per bay, per SOW-0214) exist in the wash bay location whether or not the option is elected. | If base sump is not present, drainage modifications cost would increase. | L-05-01-002, L-05-01-003 | Addendum 03 s1.8; DEP-05-01-E06 |
| ASM-EST-004 | 2026-02-18 | Environmental/effluent treatment requirements (AEP/AEPA) will be within the scope of an oil/water separator and possible municipal sewer connection. | If AEP requires more extensive treatment (e.g., closed-loop recycling, holding tank with pump-out), OPT-03 cost could exceed the $18,000 upper range significantly. | L-05-01-003 | DEP-05-01-E04; Optional_Items_Pricing.csv OPT-03 Notes |
| ASM-EST-005 | 2026-02-18 | No structural modifications to the main building are required to accommodate the wash bay. | If structural modifications are needed, they are owned by DEL-02-04 and would be additional cost outside this estimate. | All line items | Brief Cost Ownership Rules |
| ASM-EST-006 | 2026-02-18 | HVAC modifications for the heated wash area are included in OPT-01 (complete system). | If HVAC modifications are more extensive than assumed in the parametric range, the upper bound ($120,000) may be exceeded. | L-05-01-001 | Optional_Items_Pricing.csv OPT-01 Notes |
| ASM-EST-007 | 2026-02-18 | Water supply and wastewater disposal will connect to site utility stubs as coordinated by DEL-03-04. Wash bay-specific supply sizing is TBD but assumed within standard ranges. | If supply sizing requires upgrades beyond site stub capacity, additional cost may apply under DEL-03-04. | L-05-01-002 | DEP-05-01-E08 |
