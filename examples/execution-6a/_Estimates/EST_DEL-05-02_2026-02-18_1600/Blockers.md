# Blockers Report -- EST_DEL-05-02_2026-02-18_1600

## Summary

2 upstream dependencies are unresolved. Neither fully blocks the estimate (unit rates are substantiated), but both affect quantity assumptions that drive the total.

## Unresolved Dependencies

### Blocker 1: DEL-03-01 -- Site Plan, Circulation, Parking & Operational Layout

- **Dependency ID:** DEP-0502-003
- **Type:** PREREQUISITE (UPSTREAM)
- **What is needed:** Preliminary site plan to establish yard geometry, fence line location, and fixture layout planning
- **Estimate impact:**
  - Pole quantity (currently assumed at 12 per PP-20) cannot be finalized
  - Conduit run length (currently assumed at 100 lm) cannot be finalized
  - Pole spacing and placement cannot be designed
- **Affected lines:** L-0502-01 (quantity), L-0502-02 (quantity)
- **Mitigation in this run:** Per-unit rate ($7,500/light) is substantiated; total calculated at assumed 12-pole quantity with scaling formula provided

### Blocker 2: DEL-02-06 -- Electrical Power, Lighting, IT/Telecom & PA

- **Dependency ID:** DEP-0502-004
- **Type:** INTERFACE (UPSTREAM)
- **What is needed:** Base electrical design to confirm available service point location and capacity for yard panel/feeder routing
- **Estimate impact:**
  - If service point location changes, conduit run length changes
  - If capacity is insufficient, additional electrical work may be needed (outside DEL-05-02 scope per cost ownership rules)
- **Affected lines:** L-0502-02 (conduit routing assumption)
- **Mitigation in this run:** Cost ownership boundary excludes panel/breaker from this estimate (owned by DEL-02-06); conduit run length assumed based on brief distance statement
