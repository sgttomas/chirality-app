# Decision Log -- EST_DEL-05-02_2026-02-18_1600

| DecisionID | Decision | Rationale | AffectedLines |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-EST-001 | Consume `Optional_Items_Pricing.csv` rates as RATE_TABLE method despite source self-describing as `Basis=PARAMETRIC` | The `Basis` column in the source file describes how the rate was originally developed (parametric range estimation). For this estimate run, we are applying those rates as a rate table (unit rate x quantity). The distinction is: the source's development method vs. how we consume it. `BASIS_OF_ESTIMATE=RATE_TABLE` governs how this estimate applies the data, which is as a lookup table of unit rates. | L-0502-01, L-0502-02 |
| DEC-EST-002 | Use `RecommendedPrice` column (mid-range) from price source rather than PriceMin or PriceMax | RecommendedPrice ($7,500 for OPT-04; $80 for OPT-05) represents the source's best estimate within the stated range. Using mid-range is consistent with RATE_TABLE methodology. The range ($6,500-$9,000 and $65-$95) is noted in assumptions for sensitivity analysis. | L-0502-01, L-0502-02 |
| DEC-EST-003 | Present conduit run (OPT-05) as a separate fixed-cost line item rather than amortizing into per-light rate | The conduit run from the building electrical panel to the first pole is a one-time cost that does not scale linearly with the number of lights. Separating it preserves transparency and allows the Owner to see the true per-unit scaling behavior vs. the fixed mobilization cost. | L-0502-02 |
| DEC-EST-004 | Assume 12 poles for total calculation, sourced from PP-20 | PP-20 in `Assumed_Project_Parameters.csv` provides the only substantiated quantity assumption (12 poles, LOW confidence). Brief confirms quantity is TBD. The total line uses 12 as a placeholder; the per-unit rate ($7,500/light) is the primary deliverable. | L-0502-01 |
| DEC-EST-005 | Assume 100 lm conduit run length based on brief statement | The brief states "fence line approx. 100 m from nearest proposed structure" (sourced from SOW-0501 / OSR S12.2). This is used as the assumed conduit run length. Actual length TBD pending site plan from DEL-03-01. | L-0502-02 |
| DEC-EST-006 | CBS codes assigned using CSI MasterFormat Division 26 (Electrical) | No explicit CBSHint in decomposition. Yard lighting falls under CSI Division 26 -- Electrical. Two sub-codes used: 26-ELEC (fixtures/poles) and 26-COND (conduit/wiring) for clarity of cost breakdown. | L-0502-01, L-0502-02 |
| DEC-EST-007 | Exclude electrical service point (panel/breaker at building) from this estimate per cost ownership rules | Brief explicitly states electrical service point for yard lighting (panel/breaker at building) is owned by DEL-02-06. This estimate covers only the yard-side scope: poles, fixtures, bases, wiring, and conduit from panel to poles. | All |
