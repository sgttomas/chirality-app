# Risk Register -- EST_DEL-05-02_2026-02-18_1600

## Identified Risks

| RiskID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-001 | Actual pole quantity significantly differs from assumed 12 (could be 6-20 depending on site layout and spacing requirements) | MEDIUM | HIGH (total cost scales linearly at $7,500/pole) | Provide scaling formula to Owner; present as unit rate so total adjusts transparently | PP-20 notes LOW confidence; DEP-0502-003 unresolved |
| RSK-002 | Conduit run distance materially longer or shorter than 100 lm assumed | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (fixed cost changes at $80/lm; +/- $2,000-$4,000 likely range) | Update when site plan from DEL-03-01 is available | Brief statement vs. actual routing TBD |
| RSK-003 | Parametric-origin rates ($7,500/pole; $80/lm) may not reflect actual supplier pricing at time of procurement | LOW-MEDIUM | MEDIUM (source range: $6,500-$9,000/pole; $65-$95/lm) | Obtain supplier quotes before final submission; consider using PriceMax for conservative estimate | Optional_Items_Pricing.csv Confidence=MEDIUM |
| RSK-004 | Soil conditions or underground obstructions increase conduit installation cost | LOW | LOW-MEDIUM | Geotech investigation and utility locate as part of site development (DEL-03-02) would inform | Implied by underground conduit work |
