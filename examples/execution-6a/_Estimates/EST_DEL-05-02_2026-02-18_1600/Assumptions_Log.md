# Assumptions Log -- EST_DEL-05-02_2026-02-18_1600

| AssumptionID | Assumption | Source | Confidence | Impact if Wrong | Resolution Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Yard lighting pole quantity is 12 units | PP-20 in Assumed_Project_Parameters.csv | LOW | Total amount changes linearly ($7,500/unit); per-unit rate unaffected | Finalize site plan (DEL-03-01) to determine actual pole count based on perimeter spacing |
| ASM-002 | Conduit run from building electrical room to first pole is 100 linear metres | Brief statement (SOW-0501: fence line ~100 m from nearest structure) | LOW | Fixed cost changes at $80/lm; e.g., 75 m = $6,000; 125 m = $10,000 | Finalize site plan (DEL-03-01) to determine actual routing distance |
| ASM-003 | Pole height is 25-30 ft with LED fixture (IES, dark-sky compliant) per OPT-04 specification | Optional_Items_Pricing.csv OPT-04 Notes | MEDIUM | Different pole height or fixture specification would change unit rate | Confirm with Owner / lighting design during design development |
| ASM-004 | Each pole installation includes concrete base and wiring from pole-to-pole conduit run (included in $7,500/unit rate) | Optional_Items_Pricing.csv OPT-04 description: "concrete base; conduit + wiring from panel" and OPT-05 Notes: "balance in pole-to-pole rate" | MEDIUM | If pole-to-pole wiring is not included in the per-unit rate, an additional line item would be required | Verify with pricing source that pole-to-pole wiring is included in OPT-04 unit rate |
| ASM-005 | The $80/lm conduit rate (OPT-05) covers underground conduit + wiring from building to first pole only; pole-to-pole wiring is part of the per-unit rate (OPT-04) | OPT-05 Notes: "from building electrical room to perimeter; balance in pole-to-pole rate" | MEDIUM | If pole-to-pole conduit is separate, it would add cost per inter-pole segment | Confirm interpretation with pricing source |
| ASM-006 | Electrical service point (panel/breaker) at building is provided and funded by DEL-02-06; no panel cost included here | Brief cost ownership rules; DEP-0502-004 | HIGH | If panel cost needs to be in DEL-05-02, estimate increases by panel/breaker/feeder cost (estimated $3,000-$8,000 range, not priced here) | Confirm cost ownership boundary with project team |
| ASM-007 | Pricing is in 2026 CAD; no escalation or inflation adjustment applied | Implicit in price source (no date-stamping in source) | MEDIUM | If construction is significantly delayed, rates may need escalation | Apply escalation factor if construction timeline shifts materially |
