- A practical cold storage facility for seasonal equipment
- Complete site/civil infrastructure and environmental mitigation
- Robust project controls and change management framework
- Optional value-add enhancements with transparent, separable pricing

**Overall Assessment:** 75–80% proposal-ready with all major scope and requirements documented. All six packages have achieved SEMANTIC_READY status indicating comprehensive specification development with transparent identification of gaps, assumptions, and TBD items.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Early resolution of AHJ occupancy classification and seismic design category
2. Functional Program (Appendix B) access for complete space program definition
3. Stormwater pond regulatory status clarification and resolution
4. Town of Penhold municipal standards coordination
5. Active owner engagement on operational requirements and design preferences
6. Comprehensive design team coordination and cross-package interface management

**Risk Profile:** Medium (regulatory dependencies and owner coordination items require active management; otherwise standard design-build delivery framework well-documented)

**Path Forward:** Project is positioned for successful proposal development upon resolution of CRITICAL external dependencies noted above, followed by systematic design development with emphasis on regulatory approvals, owner coordination, and cross-disciplinary interface management.

**Documentation Quality:** Chirality Framework semantic enrichment has produced a robust requirements baseline with transparent identification of completeness, quality gaps, and resolution timelines.
