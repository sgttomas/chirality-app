# Guidance: DEL-03-01 — Site Plan, Circulation, Parking & Operational Layout

## Purpose

This deliverable establishes the foundational site layout for the Penhold Public Services Building (PSB) — the spatial arrangement from which all other site and building design decisions flow. It answers the question: where does everything go on the site, and how does it all connect?

The site plan is the primary coordination interface for all PKG-003 deliverables (grading, pavements, utilities, environmental compliance) and also for PKG-002 (building design) and PKG-004 (cold storage). Getting the site plan right at proposal stage demonstrates operational understanding and design credibility to the evaluators.

**Associated Objectives (ASSUMPTION — best-effort mapping per PACKAGE_HEURISTIC):**
- OBJ-005: Deliver complete site/civil works enabling safe and efficient operations — access/turning, parking, yard areas.
- OBJ-007: Provide adaptability and future expansion capability in building and site planning.

## Principles

### 1. Follow the Owner's Preferred Building Location
The preferred building location and orientation is already defined — it is shown in the Tagish Engineering Site Grading drawings (TPN46, Sheet C-2: Cut/Fill Plan). The building footprint is positioned in the western developable portion of the parcel, fronting Waskasoo Avenue. Designers should use this as the controlling constraint for all other site elements.

**Rationale:** The Owner has already invested in site grading engineering that defines a buildable pad. Departing from this preferred location without strong justification introduces risk of misalignment at award and may require additional geotechnical work. (Source: OSR §10.3.1; Addendum 03 §1.20)

### 2. Segregate Traffic by Function and Priority
The site must serve at least three distinct traffic types simultaneously:
- Fire apparatus (emergency vehicles requiring immediate, unobstructed access to Waskasoo Avenue)
- Public Works heavy equipment (graders, tandem dumps, loaders, tractors — non-emergency but high-frequency)
- Staff and visitor vehicles (cars, light trucks)

Design the circulation so that fire apparatus can exit to Waskasoo Avenue without being blocked by parked Public Works equipment or staff vehicles.

**Rationale:** Emergency response time is safety-critical. A site where fire apparatus must navigate around parked Public Works equipment creates unacceptable operational risk. (Source: OSR §10.3.1; OSR §10.3.4)

### 3. Treat Surfacing Zones as Design Decisions, Not Just Specifications
The OSR distinguishes three surface types by function:
- Heavy-duty asphalt: fire apparatus direct route to Waskasoo Avenue
- Light-duty asphalt: parking near main structure
- Aggregate: heavy equipment yard areas (remainder of site)

These zones reflect the actual loads and frequencies of use, and should be drawn on the site plan explicitly. The boundary between zones is a design decision that affects both operational performance and cost.

**Rationale:** Correctly zoning the site surfaces reduces lifecycle cost (right material in right location) and satisfies the OSR's explicit material requirements. (Source: OSR §10.3.7)

**Surface Zone Boundary Rationale (Lensing item A-006):** When placing the boundary between aggregate and asphalt zones beyond the OSR minimum requirements, designers should consider:
- **Lifecycle cost:** Asphalt has higher initial cost but lower long-term maintenance in high-traffic areas; aggregate requires periodic re-grading and dust control.
- **Dust control:** Aggregate surfaces generate dust that may affect adjacent operations, residential areas, and the nearby dog park. Dust mitigation measures (e.g., calcium chloride application) have ongoing operational cost. (See also Lensing item E-002 below in Trade-offs.)
- **Operational frequency:** Areas used daily by heavy equipment may justify asphalt even if the OSR specifies aggregate, if lifecycle analysis supports it.
- **Environmental considerations:** Aggregate yard runoff characteristics differ from asphalt; proximity to the storm retention pond may impose constraints.

**TBD:** Provide lifecycle cost comparison or decision rationale for any zone boundary placement that differs from the strict OSR minimum.

### 4. Respect the Flood Fringe as a Hard Boundary
The eastern ~8 acres of the parcel (storm retention pond, dog park, and associated flood fringe) are not suitable for building construction. The Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit identifies the floodway and flood hazard boundary. No buildings, hardscape, or structures should be proposed in the floodway. Development in the flood fringe (beyond the existing pond/dog park) may require regulatory coordination.

**Rationale:** Flood hazard constraints are regulatory — not merely advisory. AEP (Alberta Environment and Parks) may be an approval authority. Violations would result in permit refusal. (Source: Addendum 03 §1.1; Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit)

### 5. Size the Site for Future Operations, Not Just Current
The Site Grading drawings (TPN46) show a future building footprint, but the site must also accommodate:
- Future growth in Fire Department personnel (40 current → 50 future max)
- Future growth in Public Works personnel (20 current → 50 future max)
- Public Works equipment fleet expansion

Reserve space in the aggregate yard and parking areas for this growth. (Source: OSR §10.3.5)

## Considerations

### Turning Radius Requirements
Fire apparatus turning radii are large. Type 1 aerial apparatus (ladder trucks) require turning radii that can exceed 15–18 metres (swept-path). The site circulation must be validated by swept-path analysis — this is a deliverable requirement (turning templates). A drive-through bay layout for fire apparatus eliminates the need for in-site U-turns and is the typical preferred approach.

**ASSUMPTION:** Type 1 engine minimum turning radius and aerial apparatus minimum turning radius to be confirmed against the specific apparatus to be housed; the OSR references Type 1 engines and Type 1 aerial apparatus (OSR §10.3.5). **TBD (Lensing item A-005):** Confirm specific fire apparatus design vehicle dimensions (Type 1 engine wheelbase, Type 1 aerial apparatus overall length and minimum turning radius) from Fire Department or apparatus manufacturer specifications. These dimensions are required to validate the swept-path analysis and are a binding input for site plan acceptance.

### Recommended Design Software and Tools (Lensing item D-002)
The following software tools are recommended for swept-path analysis and site plan production to support calibrated practical delivery:
- **Swept-path analysis:** AutoTURN (Transoft Solutions) or Vehicle Tracking (Autodesk) are industry-standard tools for fire apparatus and heavy vehicle swept-path analysis. These tools provide accurate swept envelopes and can model specific vehicle configurations. Manual overlay templates from fire apparatus manufacturers are acceptable as a minimum alternative at proposal stage.
- **Site plan production:** AutoCAD Civil 3D or equivalent civil engineering design platform. The design platform should support coordinate referencing (for survey file integration post-award), surface modeling, and integration with the TPN46 grading drawing set.
- **Minimum capability:** The chosen swept-path tool must be capable of modeling custom vehicle profiles (wheelbase, overhang, turning radius) so that specific Fire Department apparatus dimensions can be used once confirmed.

**ASSUMPTION:** These are guidance recommendations, not mandatory requirements. The Design-Builder selects tools at their discretion, provided the deliverable quality requirements are met.

### Existing Site Features (from TPN46 Sheet C-1)
- Waskasoo Avenue (RR280) runs along the west parcel boundary — the primary and only direct road access
- Existing overhead power line runs along the west boundary (Waskasoo Avenue side) — relevance to access road design
- Existing fence on south and partial east boundaries
- Existing trees along the northwest corner (noted for removal/relocation on TPN46 C-1)
- Existing buried services at or near parcel boundary (water/wastewater stubbed at site corner; electrical, communications, gas within a few feet of site — Addendum 03 §1.6)

### Access Road Design
The Tagish Engineering drawings (TPN46, Sheet P-1: Access Road Plan/Profile) have already established the proposed access road from Waskasoo Avenue. The Design-Builder's site plan shall coordinate with and not conflict with this access road design.

**Road Access Permit Consideration (Lensing item B-004):** Waskasoo Avenue is identified as RR280 (Range Road 280), which may be under provincial (Alberta Transportation) or county (Red Deer County) jurisdiction rather than municipal (Town of Penhold) jurisdiction. If under provincial or county jurisdiction, a road access permit or approach agreement may be required for the site access connection. **TBD:** Determine the jurisdictional authority for RR280 and confirm whether an approach permit is required. This should be resolved early in design development to avoid permitting delays.

### Parking Count
No explicit minimum parking count is stated in the accessible OSR or addenda. The site plan should provide sufficient parking for:
- Fire Department operational personnel and volunteers (40 current, 50 future max per OSR §10.3.5)
- Public Works operational personnel (20 current, 50 future max per OSR §10.3.5)

**ASSUMPTION:** Parking count to be determined by the Design-Builder based on operational demand and Town of Penhold Land Use Bylaw requirements (not accessible in current sources). This is a design decision requiring civil engineer's judgment.

**Strengthened requirement (Lensing items A-001, C-001):** REQ-11 in Specification now requires a defensible, documented methodology for parking count that references (a) Town of Penhold Land Use Bylaw minimum (TBD), (b) occupancy calculations, and (c) shift pattern analysis. The methodology must be traceable and verifiable, not an assumption. For proposal submission, document the calculation methodology and obtain bylaw minimum if accessible.

### Future Expansion Layout Strategy
OBJ-007 requires adaptability and future expansion capability. At the site level, this means:
- Building footprint(s) should not consume all the developable area
- Aggregate yard areas can double as future building pad areas if needed
- Utility stub-outs should be positioned to serve future additions

**Quantified Future Expansion Capacity (Lensing item F-004):** Specification REQ-13 requires future expansion consideration but provides only qualitative language ("minimize cost and disruption"). To make this requirement verifiable, designers should establish quantified targets and document them in the site plan narrative or design brief. **TBD:** Define the following capacity targets in consultation with the Owner:
- Percentage of developable area (~12 acres) to remain unoccupied after initial construction (recommend 20-30% reserve minimum)
- Additional building area (square feet) that should be accommodable on site without major re-grading or utility relocation (recommend at least 15-20% expansion capacity)
- Parking expansion capacity (additional stalls available in designated expansion zones beyond current count)
- Utility stub-out strategy (future-ready connections for expansion areas)
- These targets should be agreed with the Owner and documented in the site plan narrative or building siting/orientation coordination note. Without quantified targets, compliance with REQ-13 cannot be objectively evaluated. (Source: OSR §10.2.1; OBJ-007)

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Aggregate Yard vs. Paved Area Extent
- **Tension:** Maximizing heavy-duty asphalt coverage improves durability and reduces dust/mud; however, it increases capital cost significantly over aggregate.
- **Resolution:** OSR §10.3.7 explicitly designates aggregate for the heavy equipment yard — the Owner has already made this trade-off decision. Pave only what OSR requires.
- **Implication for design:** The aggregate/asphalt boundary must be clearly delineated on the site plan and coordinated with pavement design (DEL-03-03).
- **Dust and Environmental Impact (Lensing item E-002):** Extensive aggregate surfacing in the yard areas will generate dust during dry conditions and may produce sediment-laden runoff during precipitation. The site is adjacent to residential areas and a dog park. Designers should consider:
  - **Dust suppression measures for aggregate areas** (calcium chloride, water application, or equivalent dust control agent) — cost and environmental compatibility must be evaluated
  - **Sediment control** at the aggregate/asphalt zone boundary to prevent runoff from aggregate areas affecting paved surfaces and downstream drainage (interface with DEL-03-02 stormwater design)
  - **Impact on adjacent properties** from dust plumes during equipment operations — the site is located near residential areas and the dog park (noted in Site Constraints), so dust generation from heavy equipment operations in aggregate areas may exceed acceptable air quality thresholds for adjacent land uses
  - **Environmental runoff characteristics** from aggregate surfaces during precipitation — sediment, dust suppression residue, and aggregate fines may affect storm retention pond water quality (interface with DEL-03-05 environmental compliance)
  - **Operational cost** of routine dust suppression as a maintenance activity — dust control is not a one-time capital cost but an ongoing operational requirement in aggregate yard areas

  **TBD (Lensing item E-002):** Confirm Owner expectations for dust and environmental impact mitigation from aggregate yard areas. For proposal submission, document dust suppression strategy (e.g., calcium chloride application schedule, water truck access, or alternative dust control method) and cost implications.

### Trade-off 2: Building Location vs. Flood Hazard Buffer
- **Tension:** Maximizing the usable footprint of the 12-acre area may push the building or yard areas closer to the flood fringe boundary.
- **Resolution:** Flood hazard constraints are regulatory hard limits. No design optimization justifies encroachment. Maintain clear buffer.
- **Source:** Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit; Addendum 03 §1.1.

### Trade-off 3: Drive-Through vs. Pull-In Bay Circulation
- **Tension:** Drive-through bays (fire apparatus enter/exit from opposite ends) eliminate turning requirements inside the site but require more linear frontage. Pull-in bays require apron turning space.
- **Resolution:** OSR §10.2 confirms four drive-through apparatus bays are required. This is already decided — the site plan circulation must provide unobstructed front and rear apron space for all bays.
- **Source:** OSR §10.2 (DEL-02-02 scope); site plan must accommodate this requirement.

### Trade-off 4: Proposal-Stage Accuracy vs. Post-Award Survey Precision
- **Tension:** At proposal stage, the Design-Builder works from the Tagish Engineering drawings and RFP exhibits. The detailed civil survey files are only provided after award (Addendum 03 §1.20). The proposal site plan may differ from the final IFC drawings.
- **Resolution:** Proposal-stage site plan should align with TPN46 and flag that coordinates will be refined upon receipt of survey files. Do not over-engineer the proposal drawings — they are conceptual.
- **Source:** Addendum 03 §1.20.

### Proposal Evaluation Criteria (Lensing item A-007)
The site plan is a proposal submission element evaluated as part of the Design Brief (RFP §7.1.2). **TBD:** No document currently captures how the Owner will evaluate or score site plan quality. If the RFP evaluation criteria include scoring rubrics for site design, the Design-Builder should reference those criteria when making design decisions. Without explicit evaluation criteria, the site plan should prioritize: (a) compliance with all stated OSR requirements, (b) operational functionality (circulation, access, parking adequacy), (c) coordination with the preferred building location (TPN46), and (d) demonstrated future expansion capability.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CON-01 | **Prescriptive Status of TPN46 (Lensing item D-001):** OSR §10.3.1 references "Appendix E — Site Grading" for the preferred building location/orientation and also mentions "Appendix F — Site Plan" for the Subdivision Plan. The Tagish Engineering drawing set TPN46 is labeled "Public Works Lot Grading" and is Issued for Construction — but the OSR refers to it as a conceptual reference. It is unclear whether TPN46 is prescriptive (must follow exactly) or indicative (preferred but adaptable). Specification REQ-02 treats TPN46 as prescriptive ("shall follow the footprint defined"), while Addendum 03 §1.20 implies post-award refinement is expected. These are in tension and create a blocking ambiguity for design direction. Resolution is required before design can proceed with confidence. | OSR §10.3.1 ("preferred site location and orientation of the building is defined in Appendix E — Site Grading") | Addendum 03 §1.20 (survey files to be provided after award — implying post-award design refinement) | Specification REQ-02; Procedure Phase A Step 2; Datasheet Building Siting | Treat TPN46 as prescriptive for building location zone/area (the western developable portion); treat exact coordinates and precise boundaries as post-award refinement pending receipt of civil survey files from the Owner. This allows compliance with TPN46 intent while accommodating post-award survey-based precision. | TBD |
| CON-02 | DEL-03-01 site plan and DEL-03-02 stormwater management both claim responsibility for drainage-related content. REQ-09 requires "positive drainage coordination with DEL-03-02," but Scope exclusions state drainage is "covered by DEL-03-02." The interface boundary — which drawing shows drainage direction arrows, slopes, and drainage infrastructure — is not precisely defined, creating risk of gap or duplication. (Lensing item E-001) | Specification REQ-09 (requires positive drainage on site plan) | Specification Scope exclusions (drainage covered by DEL-03-02) | Specification REQ-09; Specification Scope section; DEL-03-02 | DEL-03-01 shows surface drainage direction arrows and positive drainage away from buildings; DEL-03-02 provides detailed grading design and stormwater calculations | TBD |
