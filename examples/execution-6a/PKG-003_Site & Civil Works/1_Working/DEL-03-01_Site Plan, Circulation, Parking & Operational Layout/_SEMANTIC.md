# Deliverable: DEL-03-01 Site Plan, Circulation, Parking & Operational Layout

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the spatial arrangement of buildings, circulation routes, parking zones, and operational surface areas on a flood-constrained parcel. It must carry the knowledge of how site layout reconciles regulatory boundaries, emergency and heavy-equipment access demands, surfacing zone designations, and future expansion capacity into a coordinated civil design that aligns with existing grading engineering.
