## Requirements

### REQ-01: Site Development Area
**Statement:** The developable site area is approximately 12 acres within the 20-acre parcel. The eastern ~8 acres (storm retention pond, dog park, flood fringe) shall not be used for building construction.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.1
**Verification:** Site plan confirms building footprints and hardscape are within the ~12-acre developable area.

### REQ-02: Building Location and Orientation
**Statement:** The preferred building location and orientation shall follow the footprint defined in the Site Grading drawings (Tagish Engineering TPN46, Appendix E of RFP). The Design-Builder shall coordinate with civil survey/grading files provided after award.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.1; Addendum 03 §1.20
**Verification:** Building footprint on site plan overlays with TPN46 drawing reference; coordination note references survey files.

### REQ-03: Circulation Design Basis
**Statement:** Traffic circulation and parking shall be reviewed and designed to suit exterior flow, safe access to Waskasoo Avenue (RR280), and truck turning radii, while considering site restrictions (flood fringe, existing features).
**Source:** OSR §10.3.1
**Verification:** Turning templates demonstrate swept-path compliance for Type 1 engines, Type 1 aerial apparatus, and Public Works heavy equipment (graders, tandem dump units, loaders). Circulation route from each bay to Waskasoo Avenue is shown on site plan.

### REQ-04: Heavy-Duty Asphalt — Fire Apparatus Route
**Statement:** Heavy-duty asphalt shall be provided for the direct routing of fire apparatus to Waskasoo Avenue. Fire access routes shall also comply with fire code requirements for minimum road width, surface load capacity, turnaround dimensions, and fire lane signage/markings. **TBD:** Confirm specific Alberta Fire Code or National Fire Code of Canada requirements for fire access routes (minimum 6 m road width is typical; surface load capacity, signage, and fire lane markings requirements to be sourced). (Lensing item C-002)
**Source:** OSR §10.3.7; Alberta Fire Code / National Fire Code of Canada (**location TBD**)
**Verification:** Site plan designates the fire apparatus route zone as heavy-duty asphalt; fire access route width, signage, and markings verified against applicable fire code requirements (TBD); pavement design basis (to be detailed in DEL-03-03) is consistent.

### REQ-05: Light-Duty Asphalt — Parking
**Statement:** Light-duty asphalt shall be provided for parking near the main structure.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.7
**Verification:** Parking layout identifies light-duty asphalt zone; extent consistent with DEL-03-03.

### REQ-06: Aggregate — Heavy Equipment Yard Areas
**Statement:** Suitable aggregate shall be used for heavy equipment yard areas (the remainder of the site suitable for equipment to drive).
**Source:** OSR §10.3.7
**Verification:** Site plan designates aggregate yard areas; aggregate specification basis to be detailed in DEL-03-03.

### REQ-07: Concrete Aprons at Overhead Doors
**Statement:** Concrete aprons shall be provided at all overhead door access points, designed for expected service vehicle loads.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.10
**Verification:** Site plan and/or apron detail drawings show concrete aprons at every overhead door opening (main building and cold storage building).

### REQ-08: Civil Design and Construction Drawings
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall provide civil design and construction drawings for building pads, site services, and civil works meeting OSR requirements, applicable codes/standards, and good construction practice.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.2
**Verification:** Drawing set issued for construction is complete, sealed by Alberta-registered civil engineer, and addresses all OSR §10.3 site requirements.

### REQ-09: Positive Drainage Away from Buildings
**Statement:** The site plan and grading coordination shall ensure appropriate positive drainage away from all three buildings.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.2 (civil works general requirement); coordination with DEL-03-02
**Verification:** Site plan cross-references grading plan; drainage arrows/slopes confirm positive drainage. (Detailed grading design in DEL-03-02.)
**Interface Note (Lensing item E-001):** The boundary between DEL-03-01 and DEL-03-02 responsibility for drainage must be explicitly defined during proposal development. Proposed interface boundary: DEL-03-01 site plan shall show surface drainage direction arrows and positive drainage slope arrows away from all buildings and hardscape (conceptual). DEL-03-02 shall provide the detailed grading design, grade break lines, swales, stormwater calculations, and drainage infrastructure (detailed). This clarification eliminates the current ambiguity between the Scope exclusion ("drainage covered by DEL-03-02") and REQ-09 ("positive drainage coordination with DEL-03-02"). Coordinate with DEL-03-02 lead early in proposal development to confirm this boundary.

### REQ-10: Flood Hazard Constraint Compliance
**Statement:** Development works shall respect flood hazard constraints. Areas shown as floodway on the Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit and parcel flood zone exhibit are prohibited for building construction. The flood boundary shown on the site plan shall be confirmed against the authoritative regulatory authority responsible for flood hazard determination in the jurisdiction.
**Source:** Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit; Addendum 03 §1.1; SOW-0114 (shared constraint with DEL-03-05)
**Verification:** Site plan shows flood hazard boundary; all building footprints and hardscape confirmed outside prohibited areas. (Regulatory compliance documentation in DEL-03-05.) **TBD:** Identify which regulatory body (AEP or municipal authority) provides the authoritative flood boundary determination for compliance verification. For compliance verification at the IFC stage, designate the responsible authority (AEP if applicable, otherwise municipal authority) before final approval. (Lensing item A-003)

### REQ-11: Adequate Parking and Exterior Storage Space
**Statement:** The designated lands shall provide adequate parking and exterior storage space to allow for safe access onto adjacent roadways. Parking count shall be determined by a defensible methodology referencing: (a) Town of Penhold Land Use Bylaw minimum stall requirements for the applicable land use classification (TBD -- **location TBD**, bylaw not accessible), (b) occupancy calculations based on FD personnel (40 current, 50 future max) and PW personnel (20 current, 50 future max) per OSR §10.3.5, and (c) shift pattern analysis for simultaneous occupancy. The parking methodology shall explicitly account for current operations and documented future capacity requirements, including accessible parking stalls as required by applicable accessibility standards.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.1; OSR §10.3.5
**Verification:** Parking count verified against documented methodology; stall count meets or exceeds the greater of (a) bylaw minimum (TBD) or (b) calculated operational demand. **TBD:** Obtain Town of Penhold Land Use Bylaw parking requirements for institutional/industrial use to establish binding minimum. Verify accessible parking stall count and dimensions meet applicable Alberta Building Code requirements (TBD — location TBD). (Lensing items A-001, A-002, C-001)
**Note:** The previous statement "adequate parking" without a numeric threshold or calculation basis was materially ambiguous for implementation. This requirement now requires a traceable methodology that is defensible and verifiable. (Lensing item A-001)

### REQ-12: Safe Pedestrian and Vehicle Access
**Statement:** The buildings shall be accessed by volunteer firefighters and crew members with provision for safe and efficient pedestrian and truck access.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.4
**Verification:** Site plan shows pedestrian paths and vehicle access routes separated where practical; no dead-end fire apparatus lanes without turnaround.

### REQ-13: Future Expansion Consideration
**Statement:** Site planning shall minimize cost and disruption of future expansion capabilities.
**Source:** OSR §10.2.1 (Project Success Metrics)
**Note:** OBJ-007 (adaptability/expansion) is associated with PKG-003 per PACKAGE_HEURISTIC — **ASSUMPTION (best-effort mapping).**
**Verification:** Site plan narrative describes how layout accommodates future expansion (building additions or additional structures on remaining developable area).
