### Circulation & Parking
| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Design basis | Exterior flow, safe access to Waskasoo Avenue, truck turning radii, site restrictions | OSR §10.3.1 |
| Fire apparatus route surfacing | Heavy-duty asphalt — direct routing to Waskasoo Avenue | OSR §10.3.7 |
| Parking area surfacing | Light-duty asphalt — near main structure | OSR §10.3.7 |

| Concrete aprons | Required at all overhead door access points; designed for expected service vehicle loads | OSR §10.3.10 |
| Turning templates | Required to demonstrate truck/apparatus maneuverability | _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts) |
| Geotechnical reference | Geotechnical Investigation Report available (Appendix D of RFP); DB responsible for determining sufficiency. **TBD:** Confirm whether report covers the full developable area or only the proposed building pad area. Geographic coverage within the parcel is not recorded. (Lensing item B-002) | OSR §10.3.2 |
| Fire apparatus design vehicle dimensions | TBD — confirm specific Type 1 engine and Type 1 aerial apparatus dimensions (wheelbase, overall length, minimum turning radius) from Fire Department or apparatus manufacturer specifications. Required for swept-path analysis validation. (Lensing item A-005) | OSR §10.3.5; **ASSUMPTION:** standard Alberta Type 1 apparatus dimensions used as proxy until confirmed |

### Cold Storage Building Siting
| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Cold storage building footprint | 60' x 100' (6,000 sf) | _CONTEXT.md; decomposition (PKG-004 DEL-04-01) |
| Setback from main building | TBD — to be determined based on fire separation and operational access requirements | **ASSUMPTION:** fire separation requirements per Alberta Building Code will govern minimum setback. (Lensing item B-003) |
| Access requirements | TBD — confirm vehicle access route, surface treatment, and turning clearances for cold storage building access. Must include vehicle maneuverability verification for delivery and servicing vehicles accessing the cold storage building. | Procedure Step 2.3; PKG-004 DEL-04-01 (Lensing item B-003) |
| Orientation constraints | TBD — coordinate with main building orientation and overhead door placement | PKG-004 DEL-04-01 (Lensing item B-003) |

### Snow Storage & Winter Operations
| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Snow storage areas | TBD — designate snow storage zones on site plan; avoid blocking fire apparatus routes and overhead doors. Snow storage must accommodate seasonal snow accumulation from site grading and roof snow removal; location should not interfere with emergency access. | **ASSUMPTION:** northern Alberta climate requires explicit snow storage planning as a design driver. (Lensing item F-002) |
| Winter access maintenance zones | TBD — identify priority snow clearing routes (fire apparatus route first, then PW access, then parking). Develop winter maintenance sequence and timing to ensure emergency access is restored first. | **ASSUMPTION:** fire apparatus route is highest winter maintenance priority. (Lensing item F-002) |
| De-icing constraints | TBD — confirm de-icing requirements for asphalt and aggregate surfaces, and any environmental constraints on de-icing agent use near storm retention pond. Coordinate with DEL-03-02 (stormwater) and DEL-03-05 (environmental) regarding de-icing runoff management. | **ASSUMPTION:** proximity to storm retention pond may impose de-icing restrictions. (Lensing item F-002) |
