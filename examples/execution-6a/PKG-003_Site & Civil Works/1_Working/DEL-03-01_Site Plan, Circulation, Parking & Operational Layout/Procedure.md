## Steps

### Phase A — Proposal Stage Production

#### Step 1: Review Source Documents and Establish Design Constraints
1. Read OSR §10.3.1, §10.3.2, §10.3.7, §10.3.10 in full.
2. Read Addendum 03 (all 5 pages) — extract site area constraint (§1.1), service stub locations (§1.6), cash allowance confirmation (§1.7), and survey file commitment (§1.20).
3. Review Tagish Engineering drawings TPN46 — especially:
   - C-1 (Existing Site Conditions): note existing features, fence lines, overhead power, buried services, access point from Waskasoo Avenue
   - C-2 (Cut/Fill Plan): note preferred future building footprint location and orientation
   - P-1 (Access Road Plan/Profile): note proposed access road alignment to Waskasoo Avenue
4. Review Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit: identify flood hazard boundary, floodway zone, and eastern flood-fringe area (~8 acres excluded from building construction).
5. Confirm parcel legal description: Lot 1, Block 1, Plan 212 1668; NW ¼ SEC. 6-37-27 W4M.
6. Review Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) — assess whether report is sufficient for proposal stage design. **ASSUMPTION:** If insufficient for detailed design, additional geotechnical investigation will be required post-award at Design-Builder's cost (per OSR §10.3.2).

**Record:** Design constraint summary note (internal). List any gaps or TBDs that require post-award resolution.

#### Step 2: Establish Building Siting and Orientation
1. Use TPN46 Sheet C-2 (Cut/Fill Plan) as the reference for preferred building location — main building footprint in western developable area fronting Waskasoo Avenue. **Note (CON-01 / Lensing D-001):** Treat TPN46 as prescriptive for the building location zone/area but coordinates as subject to post-award refinement with survey files.
2. Obtain or estimate building footprint dimensions from architectural team (PKG-002 coordination):
   - Four drive-through fire apparatus bays (each approximately 2,000–2,200 sf per Addendum 03 §1.21 indicative sizing)
   - Public Works shop bays (approximately 2,000–2,200 sf each)
   - Support/office spaces
3. Obtain cold storage building footprint (PKG-004): 60' × 100' per Owner direction (_CONTEXT.md; decomposition). **Lensing item B-003:** Record cold storage siting parameters as explicit data attributes (setback from main building, access requirements, orientation constraints).
4. Position all building footprints on the site plan within the developable ~12-acre area, consistent with TPN46 preferred location.
5. Confirm building footprint(s) are outside the flood hazard boundary shown on the Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit.
6. Note on drawings: "Building location and orientation per Tagish Engineering TPN46 (Preferred Site Grading). Coordinates to be refined upon receipt of civil survey files from Owner following contract award per Addendum 03 §1.20."

**Output:** Building siting/orientation coordination layer on site plan.

#### Step 3: Design Site Circulation and Access
1. Establish primary vehicle access point from Waskasoo Avenue — follow TPN46 Sheet P-1 access road alignment. **TBD (Lensing item B-004):** Determine whether a road access permit or approach agreement is required for Waskasoo Avenue (RR280) connection (may be under provincial or county jurisdiction).
2. Design fire apparatus circulation route from apparatus bays to Waskasoo Avenue:
   - Route shall be unobstructed and direct
   - Designate as heavy-duty asphalt zone per OSR §10.3.7; confirm compliance with fire code access route requirements (Specification REQ-04; Lensing item C-002)
   - Confirm drive-through bay configuration (apparatus enter front, exit rear, or enter/exit from front — confirm with architectural team) **Coordination checkpoint (Lensing item F-003):** Obtain confirmed fire apparatus bay configuration from PKG-002 before finalizing circulation design. Document coordination in site plan narrative.
3. Design Public Works heavy equipment circulation:
   - Route from shop bays to aggregate yard areas and to Waskasoo Avenue
   - Identify any shared segments with fire apparatus route and assess conflict risk
4. Design staff/visitor parking access route:
   - Separate from fire apparatus route where possible
   - Designate parking area as light-duty asphalt near main structure per OSR §10.3.7
5. Identify pedestrian routes from parking to building entrances — safe separation from vehicle/apparatus routes per OSR §10.3.4.

**Output:** Circulation diagram on site plan showing labeled routes and surface zones.

#### Step 4: Prepare Turning Templates
1. Obtain design vehicle specifications for the controlling vehicles:
   - Fire apparatus: Type 1 engine and Type 1 aerial apparatus (per OSR §10.3.5) — **TBD (Lensing item A-005):** Specific vehicle dimensions (wheelbase, overall length, minimum turning radius) are required to validate swept-path analysis; obtain from Fire Department or apparatus manufacturer specifications before final proposal submission. Use standard Alberta fire apparatus swept-path templates as proxy at early proposal stage.
   - Public Works heavy equipment: tandem dump truck or grader as controlling vehicle — **ASSUMPTION:** confirm with Public Works department post-award for precise vehicle specs.
2. Run swept-path analysis (using software or manual overlay) for all critical turns:
   - Entry from Waskasoo Avenue onto site access road
   - Fire apparatus bay exits onto heavy-duty asphalt route
   - Any required on-site turning movements (where drive-through is not possible)
   - Cold storage building access **Lensing item X-003:** Include verification of cold storage vehicle access maneuverability (delivery and service vehicle turning clearances)
3. Document swept paths as plan-view overlays on the site plan or as separate turning template sheets.
4. Confirm minimum clearances are maintained to fixed objects (buildings, fencing, other parked vehicles).
5. **Recommended design tools (Lensing item D-002):** Use industry-standard swept-path analysis software (AutoTURN, Vehicle Tracking, or equivalent) capable of modeling custom vehicle profiles. This supports validated swept-path analysis once specific apparatus dimensions are confirmed.

**Output:** Turning template drawings or annotated site plan overlays.

#### Step 5: Design Parking Layout
1. Determine parking count required using a defensible, documented methodology (Lensing items A-001, C-001):
   - **Base calculation:** Fire Department current personnel (40) + Public Works current personnel (20) = 60 stalls minimum
   - **Future growth:** Consider future personnel capacity — FD 50 max + PW 50 max = potential 100 stalls
   - **Shift pattern analysis:** Account for simultaneous occupancy patterns (e.g., day shift overlap with evening volunteers)
   - **Bylaw requirement:** Verify against Town of Penhold Land Use Bylaw parking minimum for institutional/industrial use (TBD — obtain bylaw table)
   - **Final count:** Parking stall count shall meet or exceed the greater of (a) Town bylaw minimum (TBD) or (b) calculated operational demand
   - **Document the methodology:** Include calculation basis in site plan narrative or Design Brief so compliance can be verified
2. Lay out parking stalls in light-duty asphalt zone near main structure:
   - Standard stall dimensions per applicable municipal or provincial standard — **ASSUMPTION:** 2.6 m × 5.5 m standard stall; confirm per Town of Penhold bylaw (TBD). **Lensing item A-002:** Include accessible parking stalls per Alberta Building Code requirements (count and dimensions TBD — location TBD).
   - Include adequate accessible stalls per Alberta Building Code (specific count TBD until code requirements accessible)
   - Include drive aisles of adequate width for two-way circulation.
3. Label parking area on site plan: stall count, accessible stall count, surface designation (light-duty asphalt).

**Output:** Parking layout (stall plan) — may be shown on site plan or as separate sheet. Include calculation methodology documentation.

#### Step 6: Designate Surface Zones and Concrete Aprons
1. On the site plan, delineate and label all surface treatment zones:
   - Heavy-duty asphalt: fire apparatus route to Waskasoo Avenue (confirm compliance with fire access route width and standards per Specification REQ-04; Lensing item C-002)
   - Light-duty asphalt: parking near main structure
   - Concrete aprons: at every overhead door access point (main building all bays; cold storage building)
   - Aggregate: all remaining yard areas suitable for heavy equipment
2. Confirm concrete apron extent at each overhead door:
   - Sized to allow service vehicles to maneuver outside the door before entering
   - Designed for expected service vehicle loads per OSR §10.3.10
   - Coordinated with grading design (positive drainage off aprons — DEL-03-02 interface; Lensing item E-001: clarify DEL-03-01/DEL-03-02 boundary)
3. Ensure surface zone boundary lines are clearly shown and annotated.
4. **Document surface zone boundary rationale (Lensing item A-006):** If any surface zone boundaries differ from strict OSR minimum, document the lifecycle cost or operational rationale for the boundary placement (e.g., extended asphalt coverage in high-traffic areas to reduce dust or long-term maintenance cost).

**Output:** Surface zone plan layer on site plan; apron locations identified.

#### Step 7: Assemble Deliverable Package
1. Compile all drawing layers into final proposal-stage site plan sheet(s):
   - Title block with project name, legal description, scale, north arrow, date, Design-Builder name
   - Drawing reference note: "Conceptual — coordinates to be refined post-award upon receipt of Owner survey files (Addendum 03 §1.20)"
   - Alberta-registered civil engineer review (seal may not be required at proposal stage — **ASSUMPTION:** confirm with RFP §7.1.2 requirements; full IFC seal required at construction document stage)
   - **Note (Lensing item F-001):** Clarify seal requirement timeline — proposal stage vs. IFC stage per Specification REQ-08
2. Prepare turning template sheets (if separate from site plan).
3. Prepare building siting/orientation coordination note or sheet (Lensing item D-003: use consistent cross-reference format for sibling deliverables DEL-03-02, DEL-03-03, DEL-03-04, DEL-03-05).
4. Compile parking layout (if separate sheet). Include methodology documentation (Lensing items A-001, C-001).
5. **Internal peer review checkpoint (Lensing item X-004):** Conduct internal civil engineering peer review before assembly into Design Brief to verify:
   - All requirements addressed
   - Turned templates verified for controlling vehicle clearances
   - Parking count methodology documented and defensible
   - Surface zone boundaries clearly delineated
   - Cold storage integration verified (Lensing item X-003)
6. Assemble as part of Design Brief (RFP §7.1.2) for proposal submission.

**Output:** Complete DEL-03-01 proposal-stage package with peer review sign-off.

### Phase B — Post-Award Refinement

#### Step 8: Obtain and Integrate Civil Survey Files
1. Upon contract award, request civil survey files from Owner (per Addendum 03 §1.20 commitment — files from Tagish Engineering).
2. Import survey files into design software (AutoCAD Civil 3D or equivalent).
3. Reconcile proposed building locations and access road alignment with actual survey coordinates.
4. Update site plan to reflect refined coordinates and actual existing conditions.

#### Step 9: Confirm Geotechnical Adequacy
1. Review Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) against detailed site plan.
2. If report is insufficient for specific areas (e.g., cold storage location, aggregate yard subgrade), commission additional geotechnical investigation at Design-Builder's cost per OSR §10.3.2.

#### Step 10: Produce IFC Civil Drawings
1. Update all site plan drawings to IFC (Issued for Construction) standard.
2. Obtain Alberta-registered civil engineer seal on all civil construction drawings.
3. Submit for Owner review per design milestone schedule (RFP §7.1.8):
   - Building Design Development
   - 60% Detailed Design review
   - 100% Detailed Design
   - 100% IFC
