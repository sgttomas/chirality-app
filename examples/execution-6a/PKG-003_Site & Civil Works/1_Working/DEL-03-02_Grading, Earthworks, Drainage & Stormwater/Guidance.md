# Guidance: DEL-03-02 Grading, Earthworks, Drainage & Stormwater

## Purpose

This deliverable establishes the grading, earthworks, drainage, and stormwater management design for the Penhold Public Services Building site. It exists to demonstrate that the Design-Builder understands and can address the challenging soil conditions on the site, and that the proposed site development will achieve positive drainage away from all buildings, manage stormwater without an on-site storm sewer, protect constructed slopes from erosion, and prepare a stable subgrade for all buildings, roads, and paved areas.

The deliverable is a response to two core scope items:
- **SOW-0105** (OSR §10.3.2): Clearing/stripping, earthworks, grading, and foundation preparation; positive drainage integrated with existing grading.
- **SOW-0106** (OSR §11.2): Stormwater management with no on-site storm sewer; direct drainage to natural drainage off-site; erosion protection.

It supports **OBJ-005** (site civil works for public services facility). **ASSUMPTION (best-effort mapping):** OBJ-005 is associated with this deliverable based on the package-grouping heuristic applied to PKG-003.

## Principles

### 1. Source fidelity — work from the provided geotech report and site grading drawings
The Geotechnical Investigation Report (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File No. USG1123, Feb 2021) and the Site Grading drawings (Tagish Engineering TPN46, Issued for Construction, Jan 6, 2022) are the primary technical inputs for this deliverable. The OSR (§10.3.2) explicitly provides these to the Design-Builder, but also places the responsibility of supplemental investigation on the DB if the existing report is insufficient. All earthworks parameters in the Specification trace to USG1123 or TPN46 — no parameters have been invented.

**Source:** OSR §10.3.2; Geotech Report USG1123 (cover, limitations section)

### 2. Positive drainage is a non-negotiable site-wide requirement
OSR §10.3.2 requires positive drainage away from all three buildings. The geotech report (§5.1.2) specifies minimum slopes: 2% for subgrade surfaces and 3% over 3.0 m at finished grade adjacent to facilities. No water is to pond within or adjacent to buildings, roadways, or grade-supported slabs. This principle must be maintained throughout design and construction, including for the cold storage building and future ancillary buildings.

**Source:** OSR §10.3.2; Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.2

### Terminology normalization note (per item B-004)
The sand layer at approximately 1.35 m below grade has been referred to variously as "Clayey Sand (MUSC SC)," "medium plastic (SC)," and "sand" across the four documents. The **canonical term** for cross-document consistency is **"Clayey Sand (SC)"** (USCS classification). All four documents should use this canonical term when referring to this stratum. The "medium plastic" descriptor refers to the plasticity index of the fines fraction and is a property, not a name.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §4.1.4.

### 3. The clay stratum is a design constraint, not just a note
The site contains high-plasticity clay (MUSC CH) beginning at approximately 1.35 m below grade. This clay is frost active, will experience significant volume changes with moisture fluctuation, and is not suitable as a bearing stratum for shallow foundations. The implication for grading and earthworks is that: (a) high-plastic clay should not be reused as structural fill; (b) imported low-to-medium plastic soils or granular fill are preferred; and (c) subgrade moisture conditioning will likely be required. This is a material cost and schedule risk that the design approach must account for.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5 (items 2, 3); §5.1.1

### 4. No on-site storm sewer — design around natural drainage
OSR §11.2 explicitly states there is no storm sewer on-site. The design must efficiently direct freshwater from roofs and the site to natural drainage off-site. The Tagish Engineering Site Grading drawings (TPN46) show a proposed stormwater retention pond on the east side of the site and a drainage ditch as the primary conveyance approach. The Design-Builder's drainage plan must be compatible with this concept and demonstrate a complete flow path from impervious surfaces to off-site discharge.

**Source:** OSR §11.2; SOW-0106; TPN46

### 5. Geotechnical oversight is required throughout construction — not just at design
The Geotech Report (§5.1.1) specifies that qualified geotechnical personnel must monitor fill quality, proof rolling, and compaction testing. OSR §10.3.6 requires the DB to certify subgrade, imported fill, and granular base. This is not optional supervision — it is a condition of acceptable earthworks completion. The Design-Builder must price and plan for continuous geotechnical inspection throughout earthworks activities.

## Considerations

### Soil moisture conditioning
The geotech report (§5.1.1) notes that native soils will likely require drying or blending with drier soils to achieve required compaction. Alberta's climate and the typically moist subgrade conditions at this site mean that earthworks scheduling (i.e., avoiding spring thaw, wet seasons) significantly affects achievable compaction without expensive moisture conditioning. The Design-Builder should factor seasonal earthworks windows into the project schedule.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.1

### Groundwater management during construction
The groundwater table is approximately 3.0–4.0 m below grade. Excavations for foundations, utilities, and the stormwater pond will approach or encounter this depth. The geotech report notes sloughing in seven of eight deeper boreholes and seepage in eight boreholes. Dewatering plans should be anticipated for any excavation exceeding approximately 3 m, and cast-in-place concrete piles (not in scope of this deliverable) would require casing/pumping if used.

**Prescriptive direction (strengthened per item A-001):** For excavations that will encounter groundwater (generally below 3.0 m), the Design-Builder should address the following in the dewatering plan:
- **Dewatering method:** TBD -- sump pumping, wellpoints, or other method as determined by the geotechnical engineer based on excavation geometry and soil permeability (Clayey Sand SC layer has moderate permeability; underlying Clay CH has low permeability).
- **Discharge management:** TBD -- dewatering discharge shall comply with applicable environmental regulations; discharge location and sediment control to be specified.
- **Monitoring:** TBD -- piezometer or observation well monitoring during dewatering to confirm drawdown is adequate and does not adversely affect adjacent areas.
- **Triggering condition:** Any excavation exceeding 3.0 m depth in areas where groundwater is expected per Geotech Report §4.2, Table 4.3.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §4.2, §5 (item 7). See item A-001.

### Sulphate attack on concrete
Laboratory testing was not performed for water-soluble sulphate content in the soils at this site. The geotech report (§4.3) recommends designing for severe sulphate conditions (Class S-2) as a conservative precaution. All concrete in contact with native or cohesive fill (including drainage structures, culverts, aprons, and any buried slab edges) must use Type HS cement or the Type 10 + fly ash alternative. This affects concrete specification across multiple PKG-003 deliverables and must be coordinated with DEL-03-03 (aprons) and DEL-03-04 (utility structures).

**Cross-deliverable coordination (per item E-003):** The S-2 sulphate resistance requirement applies to all PKG-003 deliverables where concrete contacts native or cohesive fill. To ensure consistent quality coverage across deliverables:
- DEL-03-02 (this deliverable): Drainage structures, culvert headwalls, pond outlet structures.
- DEL-03-03 (Aprons): Concrete apron slabs in contact with subgrade.
- DEL-03-04 (Utility Structures): Buried utility encasements and manholes.

The **canonical vocabulary** for this coordination is: "Class S-2 sulphate exposure, Type HS cement or Type 10 + 25% fly ash, max w/c 0.45, per Geotech Report USG1123 §4.3 and CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Table 3." Each deliverable's Specification should use this consistent language.

### Existing grading drawings are the starting point, not the final design
The TPN46 drawings (Issued for Construction, Jan 6, 2022) represent prior civil engineering work on the site grading. Addendum 03 §1.20 instructs the Design-Builder to coordinate with these civil survey and grading files after award. The TPN46 drawings should be treated as the preferred baseline for building orientation and pond location, but the DB must reconcile them with the current project scope (which now includes the combined PSB + Cold Storage + the excluded pickled-sand building) and conduct a current topographic survey after award.

**Source:** OSR §10.3.1; Addendum 03 §1.20; TPN46

### Flood fringe constraint limits available site area
Approximately 8 acres of the 20-acre parcel (the storm retention pond area and dog park) are in the flood fringe and not suitable for building construction. The remaining ~12 acres must accommodate both departments' operational needs. Grading and earthworks must respect this constraint. See DEL-03-05 for flood hazard compliance detail.

## Trade-offs

### Import clean granular fill vs. reuse native soil
**Tension:** Reusing stripped topsoil and excavated material would reduce import costs and spoil disposal costs. However, the native sand is medium plastic (SC) and the clay is high plastic (CH) — both require moisture conditioning to compact to specification, and high-plastic clay must not be used as structural fill.

**Resolution:** The geotech report recommends using low-to-medium plastic soils as fill but acknowledges native soils may require moisture conditioning. The practical resolution will depend on the cut/fill balance of the site (TPN46 shows significant cut quantities on the east side and fill on the west side). Imported 80 mm minus pit run gravel will likely be needed under slabs and roadways regardless.

**Estimation guidance for imported fill (per item F-004):** At the proposal stage, the estimator should consider the following when pricing imported granular fill:
- **Quantity drivers:** (a) Total area under building slabs, parking, and aprons requiring granular base; (b) net fill deficit if cut/fill balance analysis shows more fill than cut; (c) volume of unsuitable material (high-plastic clay, organics) that must be replaced with imported fill.
- **Unit cost factors:** Source distance for 80 mm minus pit run gravel (City of Red Deer specification); hauling distance from nearest approved pit; placement and compaction cost per m3.
- **Risk contingency:** Native Clayey Sand (SC) may be reusable if moisture-conditioned, but moisture conditioning adds cost. If spring/wet-season conditions prevail, assume higher import percentages.
- **TBD:** Cut/fill balance quantities are not yet extracted from TPN46 (see Datasheet and REQ-3216). Until quantities are available, the cost estimate for imported fill is preliminary.

### Proof rolling vs. compaction testing (verification approach)
**Tension:** Proof rolling is a qualitative check; compaction testing (field density testing) is quantitative. Both are specified, but each has cost implications.

**Resolution:** The geotech report requires both. Proof rolling identifies soft spots; field density testing verifies compaction to specification. The minimum frequency (1 test per lift per 500 m²) should be treated as a floor, not a ceiling. High-risk areas (under slabs, near pond slopes) may warrant higher frequency.

**Rationale for frequency determination (per item A-005):** The 1 per lift per 500 m2 minimum is a standard industry practice for field density testing on sites with relatively uniform fill conditions. Higher frequency should be considered when:
- Fill is placed over variable subgrade conditions (e.g., transition from Clayey Sand (SC) to high-plasticity Clay (CH) at ~1.35 m depth).
- Fill is placed on embankment slopes where compaction is inherently more difficult to achieve.
- Structural fill zones (>1.2 m thick, requiring 100% SPDD) demand greater verification confidence.
- Moisture conditioning has been required, increasing variability in compaction results.
**TBD:** The geotechnical engineer should define the elevated testing frequency for high-risk zones at the start of construction.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.1. See item A-005.

### Stormwater pond sizing vs. off-site drainage capacity
**Tension:** A larger stormwater pond provides more attenuation but consumes more of the limited buildable area. The TPN46 drawing shows the pond in the flood fringe area, which may have regulatory implications.

**Resolution:** The pond location shown in TPN46 is the logical starting point; however, the Design-Builder **must confirm** whether the pond is in the flood fringe and whether environmental or municipal approvals are required. This crosses into DEL-03-05 (Environmental Constraints, Flood Hazard & Regulatory Compliance) territory. The drainage design approach **must be coordinated between DEL-03-02 and DEL-03-05**.

**Critical blocking issue (per item D-001 — unresolved compliance mandate):** REQ-3212 mandates construction of the stormwater retention pond, **but** Conflict Table entry C3202-02 identifies that the pond location may require environmental/municipal approvals that are **outside this deliverable's scope** (DEL-03-05 territory). The mandate is **unresolved** until the regulatory outcome is known.

**Mandatory sequencing constraint:** The Design-Builder **shall not proceed with pond construction** without:
1. Confirmation from DEL-03-05 that flood fringe/environmental approvals are obtained or in progress.
2. Written approval from the Owner/AHJ (Town of Penhold) confirming the pond location is acceptable.
3. Design storm and sizing criteria confirmed (per item X-001 — authoritative sufficiency benchmark).

This is a blocking dependency requiring coordination between DEL-03-02 and DEL-03-05 before design finalization.

### Drainage design benchmark (per item X-001 — authoritative sufficiency benchmark)
**TBD:** No design storm event, rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) data, or return period has been specified in any accessible source for the Penhold site. The stormwater retention pond (REQ-3212), drainage ditches, and outlet protection must be sized to a design standard, but no benchmark is currently stated. This is a critical gap for the drainage design.

**Prescriptive direction for establishing the benchmark:** The civil engineer **shall** complete the following tasks before finalizing the drainage design:
1. Obtain IDF curves for the Penhold/Red Deer area from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) or the Town of Penhold.
2. Confirm the required design storm return period (e.g., 1:25 year, 1:100 year) with the Town of Penhold Municipal Development Standards (see item A-003 — standards applicability TBD).
3. Document the selected design storm (return period, duration, rainfall intensity) in the drainage design basis.
4. Apply the design storm to size: (a) stormwater pond capacity, (b) drainage ditch cross-sections and slopes, (c) outlet flow rate and protection.
5. Confirm the design storm selection with the Owner/AHJ before finalizing the design.

Without an established benchmark, the drainage system design cannot be verified as compliant. This is a blocking prerequisite for design completion.

**Source:** No accessible source currently provides IDF data. See item X-001 and Specification REQ-3212.

## Examples

### Drainage slope application
The geotech report (§5.1.2) specifies that the finished grade adjacent to facilities shall be graded at a minimum slope of 3% over a distance of 3.0 m, and subgrade surfaces directed toward drainage ditches at a minimum 2%. This translates to a minimum of 90 mm of fall in 3.0 m around building perimeters. The TPN46 Sheet C4 (Design Grade Plan) shows contour data and spot grades that reflect this intent.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.2; TPN46 Sheet C4

### Cut/fill plan reference
TPN46 Sheet C2 (Cut/Fill Plan) and Sheet C3 (Cut/Fill Contour Plan) show the proposed building footprint location and the stormwater pond on the eastern portion of the site. Sheet C4 shows the Design Grade Plan with spot elevations, drainage ditches, and outlet control structures. These drawings provide the spatial framework within which the Design-Builder's grading plan must operate.
