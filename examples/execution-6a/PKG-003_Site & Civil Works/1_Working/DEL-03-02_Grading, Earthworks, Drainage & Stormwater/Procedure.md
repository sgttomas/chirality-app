| Addendum 03 — §1.1 (site area/flood fringe), §1.20 (grading coordination) | Available — _Sources/ (specific text location TBD) |
| DEL-03-01 (Site Plan, Circulation, Parking) | Coordinate — building orientation and pond location affect grading |
| DEL-03-05 (Environmental Constraints, Flood Hazard) | Coordinate — flood fringe limits affect stormwater pond location |
| Civil Engineer and Geotechnical Engineer on team | Required for production and certification |

### Part B — Construction Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Status |
|---|---|
| Issued-for-Construction grading plan and drainage plan | To be produced by DB Civil Engineer during design phase |
| Geotechnical Engineer retained | Required per OSR §10.3.6 |
| Current topographic survey after award | Required; coordinate with civil survey files per Addendum 03 §1.20 |
| Approved construction methodology | Earthworks methodology approved by geotechnical engineer |
| Alberta OHS Code 2009, Part 32 compliance plan | Required for all excavations >1.5 m |
| Permits and approvals | TBD — stormwater pond and drainage outlet may require municipal or provincial approvals |
| Seasonal earthworks scheduling assessment | **New (per item D-002):** The Design-Builder shall assess seasonal earthworks scheduling constraints prior to mobilization. Earthworks should avoid spring thaw and wet seasons where practicable, as native Clayey Sand (SC) and Clay (CH) soils require moisture conditioning to achieve specified compaction (Geotech Report §5.1.1). If earthworks must proceed during wet periods, the construction methodology shall include provisions for moisture conditioning, increased drying time, or use of imported granular fill in lieu of native soils.

## Steps

### Part A — Producing the Proposal Deliverable

**Step A-1: Review existing civil documents and establish design storm benchmark**
1. Review the Tagish Engineering TPN46 drawings (Sheets C1–C4, P-1, P-2, D-1) to understand existing site conditions (Sheet C1), proposed cut/fill extents (Sheets C2, C3), design grades (Sheet C4), access road profile (Sheet P-1), and drainage ditch details (Sheet D-1). Note that these drawings were prepared for an earlier development concept and must be reconciled with the current PSB program.
2. **Establish the design storm benchmark (per item X-001):** Obtain or confirm the design storm return period and IDF data for Penhold/Red Deer area. Consult the Town of Penhold Municipal Development Standards (see item A-003) to confirm required design storm (e.g., 1:25 year, 1:100 year). Document this selection in the drainage design basis.

**Source:** TPN46 (all sheets); _SEMANTIC_LENSING item X-001

**Step A-2: Review geotechnical report**
Review USG1123 Section 5.1 (Recommendations for Site Grading and Earthworks) in full, including §5.1.1 (Engineered Fill), §5.1.2 (Drainage), §5.1.3 (Cut Slopes), §5.1.4 (Fill Embankment Slopes), and §5.1.5 (Temporary Excavations). Extract all design parameters (compaction specifications, slope geometry, drainage slopes, proof rolling requirements) and confirm they are reflected in the Specification and Grading Plan.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1

**Step A-3: Identify OSR requirements for grading and stormwater**
Confirm SOW-0105 (OSR §10.3.2) and SOW-0106 (OSR §11.2) requirements are addressed. Key items to verify:
- Positive drainage away from all three buildings confirmed in plan
- No storm sewer on-site — complete off-site discharge path demonstrated
- Erosion protection specified at all outlets and exposed slopes
- DB retains geotechnical services for subgrade and fill certification

**Source:** OSR §10.3.2, §11.2; SOW-0105, SOW-0106

**Step A-4: Confirm flood fringe and stormwater pond regulatory status (blocking dependency per item D-001)**
**Critical:** Confirm with DEL-03-05 whether the proposed stormwater pond location (TPN46 Sheet C2) is within the flood fringe and what regulatory approvals are required. Do not finalize the grading or drainage plan as approved until regulatory status is confirmed.

Specific actions:
1. Consult DEL-03-05 (Environmental Constraints, Flood Hazard & Regulatory Compliance) for flood fringe assessment.
2. Confirm whether the pond location requires municipal or provincial approvals.
3. If approvals are required, flag this as a blocking dependency and ensure the Design-Builder's schedule accounts for approval timelines.
4. Document the approval status and any conditions in the Drainage Plan narrative.

Without approval confirmation, the pond mandate (REQ-3212) remains unresolved and construction cannot proceed.

**Source:** Decomposition SOW-0102, SOW-0114; TPN46 Sheet C2; _SEMANTIC_LENSING item D-001

**Step A-5: Draft grading narrative**
Write the grading narrative addressing:
- Stripping and clearing scope (extent and depth)
- Cut/fill approach (reference TPN46 as baseline, note post-award reconciliation)
- **Cut/fill balance analysis (per item A-002 — mandatory practice):** Include estimated cut and fill quantities, import requirements, and spoil disposal volumes. This is a mandatory deliverable for cost estimation. See REQ-3216.
- Subgrade preparation sequence (strip, proof roll, fill, compact, certify)
- Design grades and positive drainage approach (building perimeters, roadways, yards) — explicitly confirm minimum 3% slope at building perimeters and 2% subgrade slope to ditches
- Earthworks material management (import vs. reuse strategy and constraints) — address moisture conditioning requirements for native Clayey Sand (SC) and Clay (CH) materials; discuss cost implications of imported granular fill (per item F-004 — acceptable valuation baseline)

**Step A-6: Draft earthworks/subgrade preparation narrative**
Write the earthworks narrative addressing:
- Compaction specifications (98% SPDD cohesive, 100% SPDD structural fills)
- Granular fill specification (80 mm minus pit run; City of Red Deer gradation)
- Geotechnical testing frequency (1 test per lift per 500 m²)
- Proof rolling procedure (80 kN axle load; geotechnical observation required)
- Moisture conditioning approach for native soils

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.1

**Step A-7: Draft drainage and stormwater narrative**
Write the drainage narrative addressing:
- No on-site storm sewer; complete flow path to natural drainage off-site
- Roof drainage — direct to natural drainage via grades and swales; no storm sewer connection
- Site drainage — minimum 2% subgrade slopes to ditches; minimum 3% finished grade at building perimeters
- **Stormwater retention pond** — location (TPN46 east side), **size (to be determined by design storm per item X-001)**, outlet control structure, **emergency overflow provisions (per item F-001 — prescribed compliance sufficiency)**. **Critical:** Include dependency note confirming regulatory approvals obtained or in progress (per item D-001).
- Drainage ditch profile (TPN46 Sheet D-1); include **outlet design criteria (per item F-002 — exhaustive statutory scope):** protection type, sizing methodology, permissible outlet velocity, energy dissipation
- **Permanent erosion control at all outlets (per item C-003 — missing operational completeness):** slope seeding, armoring, or other post-grading stabilization
- **Dewatering plan for excavations approaching 3.0–4.0 m depth (per item A-004 — missing operational slot):** dewatering method, discharge management, monitoring; reference Geotech Report §4.2

**Source:** OSR §11.2; Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.2; TPN46; _SEMANTIC_LENSING items X-001, F-001, F-002, C-003, A-004

**Step A-8: Draft erosion control narrative**
Write the erosion control narrative addressing:
- Erosion protection at drainage outlets (riprap or other outlet protection)
- Slope cover (polyethylene sheeting on cut slopes >3.0 m while exposed)
- Construction phasing to minimize exposed subgrade area during precipitation seasons
- Temporary erosion control measures during construction

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.3; SOW-0106

**Step A-9: Assemble and cross-check**
Review the full grading, earthworks, drainage, and erosion control narrative against:
- Specification requirements REQ-3201 through REQ-3215
- Consistency with Datasheet values (slopes, compaction specs, groundwater depth)
- Consistency with DEL-03-01 (site plan building locations affect drainage layout)
- Consistency with DEL-03-03 (aprons and pavement affect subgrade preparation and compaction specs)

### Part B — Design and Construction Implementation

**Phase B-1: Post-Award Design**

1. Obtain current topographic survey of the site after award; reconcile with TPN46 existing conditions drawing (Sheet C1) to identify any changes since January 2022. **Verification step (per item F-003 — essential execution threshold):** Confirm topographic survey is completed and reconciled with TPN46 in writing before grading plan finalization proceeds.
2. Engage civil engineer to produce updated grading plan, drainage plan (including design storm basis per item X-001), and erosion control plan (including permanent post-grading stabilization per item C-003) based on current building program and site survey.
3. Retain geotechnical engineer; confirm whether USG1123 is sufficient or supplemental investigation is required (per OSR §10.3.6). **TBD:** Define trigger criteria for insufficiency (per item X-005).
4. **Confirm stormwater pond regulatory status (blocking dependency per item D-001):** Coordinate with DEL-03-05 to confirm flood fringe assessment and regulatory approvals. Do not finalize pond design without approval status.
5. **Prepare dewatering plan (per item A-004):** For any excavation expected to encounter groundwater below 3.0 m depth, prepare dewatering method, discharge management, and monitoring approach.
6. Submit grading and drainage plans for Owner review as part of design submission. Plans shall include: (a) design storm basis, (b) pond sizing calculations, (c) outlet protection design criteria, (d) permanent erosion control approach, (e) cut/fill balance analysis, (f) dewatering plan (if applicable).

**Phase B-2: Construction Mobilization**

1. Confirm Alberta OHS Code Part 32 compliance plan is in place for all anticipated excavations exceeding 1.5 m.
2. Confirm geotechnical engineer is engaged and available for construction oversight (proof rolling, compaction testing, subgrade certification).
3. Set up erosion controls at construction boundaries prior to disturbing any vegetation.

**Phase B-3: Clearing and Stripping**

1. Strip vegetation, topsoil (average ~72 mm), organics, and non-structural fill from all areas requiring subgrade support.
2. Stockpile suitable stripped material for potential reuse (if within low-to-medium plastic specification and moisture condition allows).
3. **Dispose of unsuitable material (high-plastic clay, organics) off-site (per item E-002 — missing operational completeness).** Document spoil disposal: (a) location (off-site disposal facility approved by environmental/Owner); (b) material type and volume; (c) environmental compliance requirements. Maintain spoil disposal records for submission.
4. Geotechnical engineer to observe stripped subgrade prior to any fill placement.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1; SOW-0105; _SEMANTIC_LENSING item E-002

**Phase B-4: Grading and Earthworks**

1. In areas requiring fill to raise grades: proof roll existing subgrade (two passes, 80 kN single axle dual-wheel truck), observed by geotechnical personnel.
2. Sub-excavate soft spots identified during proof rolling; replace with competent material.
3. Place engineered fill in lifts not exceeding 200 mm (cohesive) or 150 mm (embankment slopes).
4. Compact to specified density (98% SPDD general; 100% SPDD under structural fills >1.2 m thick).
5. Conduct field density testing at minimum 1 test per lift per 500 m²; **for embankment slopes specifically, document compaction testing results (per item X-002 — applied essential requirement)**. Document results; failing tests require remedial action and re-testing.
6. In areas of cut: excavate to design subgrade elevation; compact exposed subgrade; perform proof roll.
7. **Maintain cut slope geometry per REQ-3208 (3H:1V for fine-grained soils 3.0–6.0 m; 2.5H:1V for low moisture conditions ≤3.0 m). Express all slope geometry using canonical notation H:V (horizontal:vertical) for consistency (per item X-004 — normalization).**
8. **For fill slopes exceeding 6.0 m in height, obtain formal written approval from qualified Geotechnical Engineer prior to placing fill (per item E-001 — prescribed sufficiency benchmark). This is a hold point.**

**Phase B-5: Foundation and Subgrade Preparation**

1. Place granular base (80 mm minus pit run gravel) below building slabs, parking lots, and aprons; compact to specification.
2. Geotechnical engineer to certify exposed subgrade and prepared granular base in writing prior to concrete or structure placement.
3. Provide certified imported fill documentation if imported granular material is used.

**Phase B-6: Drainage Infrastructure Construction**

1. Construct drainage ditches per TPN46 Sheet D-1 profile and detail.
2. Construct stormwater retention pond to design geometry; install outlet control structure per design.
3. Install outlet protection (riprap or equivalent) at all drainage outlets to prevent erosion.
4. Confirm all finished grades achieve minimum 2% slope to drainage ditches; minimum 3% over 3.0 m at building perimeters.
5. Verify complete flow path from impervious surfaces to off-site natural drainage.

**Source:** OSR §11.2; TPN46; SOW-0106

**Phase B-7: Erosion Control Maintenance**

1. Maintain erosion controls throughout construction; inspect after each significant precipitation event.
2. Cover exposed cut slopes >3.0 m with polyethylene sheeting during construction to prevent rainfall erosion and drying.
3. Stabilize completed slopes (seeding or other permanent erosion control) promptly after grading is complete.
