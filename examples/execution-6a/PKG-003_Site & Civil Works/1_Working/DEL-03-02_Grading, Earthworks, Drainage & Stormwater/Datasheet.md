### Site Conditions

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Site legal description | Lot 1, Block 1, Plan 212 1668; NW ¼ SEC. 6-37-27 W4M | Decomposition; OSR §10.3.1 |
| Site area (total parcel) | ~20 acres (~9.97 ha at time of geotech investigation) | Decomposition SOW-0102; Geotech Report §2.1 |
| Developable area (approx.) | ~12 acres (excluding storm retention pond and dog park in flood fringe) | Decomposition SOW-0102 |

| Topsoil average thickness | 72 mm | Geotech Report §4.1.3 |
| Sand layer (canonical term) | **Clayey Sand (SC)** — USCS classification SC, average depth ~1.35 m below grade; moisture content avg 11.2%. See item B-004 for terminology normalization. | Geotech Report §4.1.4 |
| Clay layer | High plasticity clay (MUSC CH); avg undrained shear strength 90 kPa (weighted avg design value) | Geotech Report §4.1.5 |

This conservative approach is appropriate given the absence of direct testing. See item B-003. | Geotech Report §4.3 |

## Conditions

| Condition | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Frost active subgrade | Clay is frost active; volume changes during freezing/thawing expected; unheated on-grade structures not recommended | Geotech Report §5 (item 2) |
| High plasticity clay | Not suitable as bearing stratum for shallow foundations; will experience significant volume changes | Geotech Report §5 (items 2, 3) |
| Groundwater variability | Water table depth varies seasonally and near Waskasoo Creek; seepage expected in excavations below ~3–4 m | Geotech Report §4.2 |
| No storm sewer on-site | All stormwater directed to natural drainage off-site | OSR §11.2 |
| Flood fringe constraint | Storm retention pond and dog park in flood fringe not suitable for building construction | Decomposition SOW-0102 |
| Cobbles and boulders | Till may contain random cobbles, boulders, or pockets of granular soils | Geotech Report §4.1.6 |
| Existing grading drawings available | Tagish Engineering TPN46 (Issued for Construction, Jan 6, 2022); design grade, cut/fill, and drainage ditch details shown | Site Grading drawings TPN46 |
| Geotechnical report vintage | Report dated Feb 2021; conditions may have changed; DB may need supplemental geotech if insufficient. **TBD (per item B-002):** Define trigger criteria for "insufficient" — clarify what qualifies as "insufficient" (e.g., site conditions materially different from USG1123, new construction loads not addressed, groundwater levels inconsistent with piezometer readings, geotechnical investigations as-built soil conditions). This definition is essential for cost estimation and schedule planning. See REQ-3214 and item X-005. | OSR §10.3.2 |

## Construction

| Element | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Clearing and stripping | Remove vegetation, organics, topsoil, non-structural fill prior to any earthworks | Geotech Report §5.1; SOW-0105 |
| Grading plan | Integrate with Tagish Engineering TPN46 design grade plan; coordinate with civil survey/grading files after award | OSR §10.3.1; Addendum 03 §1.20; TPN46 Sheet C4 |
| Cut/fill balance | TBD (cut/fill plan shown in TPN46 Sheet C2 and C3; quantities not extracted). **Essential fact for proposal stage (per item B-001):** Cut/fill quantity estimates are mandatory for cost estimation and earthworks planning. Civil engineer must extract from TPN46 or perform independent take-off. This is a critical input for material management and budget forecasting. See REQ-3216 and Specification item A-002. | TPN46 |
