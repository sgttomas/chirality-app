### REQ-3210 — Temporary Excavation Safety
**Statement:** Temporary construction excavations shall comply with Alberta's Occupational Health and Safety Code, 2009, Part 32 — Excavating and Tunnelling. Proper cutback and/or shoring shall be provided for all excavations exceeding 1.5 m in depth where worker access is required. Excavations greater than 1.5 m shall be inspected by a geotechnical engineer for signs of seepage and instability, and at three-month intervals unless slopes are frozen. No water shall be permitted to pond on side slopes or at the base of any excavation.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.5

---

### REQ-3211 — Stormwater Management (No Storm Sewer)
**Statement:** There is no storm sewer on-site. Roof and site drainage shall be directed to appropriate natural drainage off-site. Efficient drainage of freshwater flow from roof structures to natural drainage off-site shall be provided. The Design-Builder shall provide erosion protection at drainage outlets.

**Source:** OSR §11.2; SOW-0106

---

### REQ-3212 — Stormwater Retention Pond
**Statement:** A proposed stormwater retention pond shall be provided on the east side of the site as shown in Tagish Engineering Site Grading drawings TPN46 (Sheets C2, C3, C4). Pond geometry, outlet control structure, and outlet protection shall be designed to direct drainage to natural drainage off-site.

**Sizing criteria (per item F-001):** Pond capacity, design storm event (return period and duration), and outlet flow rate are **TBD**. The stormwater pond shall be designed using:
- Design storm return period: TBD (confirm with Town of Penhold Municipal Development Standards; see item A-003)
- Design storm duration: TBD
- Pond capacity: TBD (m³)
- Outlet flow rate: TBD (L/s)
- Emergency overflow provisions: TBD

These criteria are essential for final sizing and must be determined by the civil engineer in coordination with municipal standards.

**Regulatory approval dependency (per item D-001):** The pond location shown in TPN46 may be in the flood fringe and require environmental/municipal approvals (see DEL-03-05 scope, SOW-0114). The Design-Builder shall not proceed with pond construction without confirmation that necessary approvals are obtained or in progress.

**ASSUMPTION:** The pond configuration shown in TPN46 (Issued for Construction, Jan 6, 2022) is the Owner's preferred starting point for design. Final pond sizing and design is the Design-Builder's responsibility in coordination with the civil engineer.

---

### REQ-3213 — Erosion Control
**Statement:** Erosion protection shall be provided at all drainage outlets and cut slope surfaces exposed to rainfall. Slopes over 3.0 m shall be covered with polyethylene sheeting to protect from rainfall and reduce drying. Surface water shall be directed away from the top of all cut surfaces to prevent erosion and loss of soil strength.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.3; SOW-0106

---

### REQ-3214 — Geotechnical Services
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall retain all necessary geotechnical services to safely excavate material, certify imported fill material, certify the exposed and prepared subgrade, and certify the prepared granular base below buildings and elsewhere on site. If the existing Geotech Report (USG1123, Feb 2021) is found insufficient to effectively design and construct the facilities, the Design-Builder shall undertake and pay for additional geotechnical investigation.

**Source:** OSR §10.3.6; OSR §10.3.2

---

### REQ-3215 — Concrete Sulphate Resistance
**Statement:** All concrete in contact with native or cohesive fill shall be designed for severe sulphate exposure (Class S-2) using sulphate-resistant Portland Cement Type HS (minimum 56-day compressive strength 32 MPa, maximum water-cement ratio 0.45 per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014, Table 3) or Type 10 cement with approximately 25% Type F or CI fly ash by mass. Calcium chloride admixtures shall not be used.

**Source:** Geotech Report USG1123 §4.3

---

### REQ-3216 — Cut/Fill Balance Documentation
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall prepare a cut/fill balance analysis documenting estimated cut and fill quantities, import requirements, and spoil disposal volumes. The analysis shall be based on the current topographic survey (post-award) reconciled with the design grading plan. At the proposal stage, a preliminary estimate based on TPN46 Sheets C2 and C3 shall be provided.

**ASSUMPTION:** This requirement is inferred from the need for earthworks cost estimation and material management planning; the geotech report and TPN46 drawings provide the spatial framework but no requirement explicitly mandates a cut/fill balance deliverable.

**Source:** TPN46 Sheets C2, C3 (spatial framework); Geotech Report USG1123 §5.1.1 (material specifications). See item A-002.

---

### REQ-3217 — Permanent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization
**Statement:** Upon completion of grading, all completed slopes shall be stabilized with permanent erosion control measures (seeding, armoring, or other approved methods) promptly after grading is complete. Permanent erosion control is distinct from the temporary construction-phase erosion protection required under REQ-3213.

**ASSUMPTION:** This requirement is inferred from Procedure Phase B-7 step 3, which describes permanent stabilization. No explicit requirement for permanent erosion control exists in the accessible sources beyond temporary measures in REQ-3213.

**Source:** Procedure.md Phase B-7 step 3; SOW-0106 (erosion protection scope). See item C-003.

---

### REQ-3218 — Drainage Outlet Design Criteria
**Statement:** Drainage outlets (from drainage ditches, stormwater pond outlet, and roof drainage discharge points) shall be designed with outlet protection sized to prevent erosion at the outlet and downstream. Outlet protection type, sizing, velocity limits, and energy dissipation requirements shall be specified in the drainage plan.

**Design criteria (per item F-002 — exhaustive statutory scope):** Specific outlet design criteria **TBD**:
- Outlet protection type (riprap, articulated blocks, gabions, or other): TBD
- Sizing methodology (reference standard or empirical formula): TBD
- Permissible outlet velocity (m/s): TBD
- Energy dissipation approach: TBD

These criteria are to be determined by the civil engineer based on design storm event (see REQ-3212) and municipal standards (see item A-003).

**ASSUMPTION:** This requirement is inferred from REQ-3211 and REQ-3213 which reference erosion protection at drainage outlets without specifying design criteria.

**Source:** REQ-3211; REQ-3213; SOW-0106; _SEMANTIC_LENSING item F-002.
