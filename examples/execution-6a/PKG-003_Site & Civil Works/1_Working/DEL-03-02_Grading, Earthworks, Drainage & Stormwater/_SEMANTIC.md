# Deliverable: DEL-03-02 Grading, Earthworks, Drainage & Stormwater

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to define the types, categories, and values governing how site terrain is shaped, water is managed, and soil is prepared for the Penhold Public Services Building. It must carry knowledge spanning the full lifecycle from stripping and clearing through grading, earthworks compaction, drainage conveyance, stormwater retention, erosion control, and geotechnical certification -- all conditioned by challenging clay subgrade, absence of storm sewer infrastructure, and flood fringe constraints.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
