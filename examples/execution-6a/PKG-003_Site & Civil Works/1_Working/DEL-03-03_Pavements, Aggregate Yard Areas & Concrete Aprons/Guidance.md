# Guidance: DEL-03-03 Pavements, Aggregate Yard Areas & Concrete Aprons

## Purpose

This deliverable establishes the design basis and documentation requirements for all surfaced areas at the Penhold Public Services Building (PSB) site. The facility must support simultaneous operations of a fire hall (24/7 emergency response), public works yard, and cold storage — each with distinct vehicle loading and surfacing requirements.

The purpose of differentiating surfacing zones (heavy asphalt, light asphalt, aggregate yard, concrete aprons) is to:
- Ensure fire apparatus can reach Waskasoo Avenue without surface degradation under emergency loading.
- Provide safe, weather-resistant parking for staff and visitors.
- Provide a durable, all-season surface for heavy public works equipment operations.
- Provide structural concrete at overhead door thresholds that can withstand repeated heavy vehicle ingress/egress without damage.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Match Surface to Load

Surfacing type must be selected based on the actual anticipated loading, not a uniform "heavy everything" approach. The Geotechnical Investigation Report provides AASHTO design thicknesses calibrated to the site's subgrade (Mr = 45,000 kPa). Applying oversized pavement sections universally increases cost without proportional benefit; applying undersized sections risks premature failure under emergency vehicle loading.

The three-zone strategy in OSR §10.3.7 reflects this load-matching philosophy: the most expensive and structurally demanding pavement (heavy duty asphalt) is limited to the fire apparatus routing, while lower-cost aggregate serves the equipment yard where formal pavement durability is not required.

### Principle 2: Design for Frost and Sulphate Conditions

Penhold's frost penetration depth of 2.0 m governs pavement behaviour seasonally. The pavement cross-sections recommended in the Geotechnical Investigation Report account for frost heave risk through appropriate layer depths and use of free-draining granular sub-base material. Do not reduce SGSB layer thickness without geotechnical engineer concurrence.

Sulphate is present in the native soils. Concrete at the aprons will be in direct contact with sub-base and subgrade, creating an exposure pathway. CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Class S-2 requirements (Type HS cement, 32 MPa at 56 days, max w/c 0.45) protect the concrete from sulphate attack over the facility's design life. These requirements are non-negotiable — do not substitute ordinary Portland cement (Type GU) without geotechnical engineer approval.

### Principle 3: Subgrade Quality Controls are Critical

The sand and clay subgrade at this site is moisture-sensitive (Clayey Sand SC, medium plasticity). Subgrade disturbance during construction — particularly in wet conditions — can significantly reduce effective subgrade support and invalidate the pavement design assumptions. Proof rolling and compaction control are therefore not optional quality activities; they are fundamental to the validity of the pavement design.

If proof rolling reveals soft/yielding subgrade zones, the depth of over-excavation and replacement material must be determined by the geotechnical engineer on site. Do not proceed with SGSB placement until soft zones are remediated.

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8.

### Principle 4: Aggregate Yard is Functional, Not Decorative

The aggregate yard surfacing supports heavy public works equipment (graders, dump trucks, backhoes) in a working yard environment. The 80 mm minus pit run gravel specification provides adequate bearing capacity and drainage while minimizing cost. The key performance criteria are:
- No rutting under equipment loads at maximum moisture conditions.
- Positive surface drainage (≥2% cross slope) to prevent ponding, which degrades the subgrade and accelerates deterioration.

Formal pavement design (asphalt or concrete) is not required for these areas per OSR §10.3.7, but adequate depth and compaction are required to achieve functional performance.

### Principle 5: Concrete Aprons Must Match Overhead Door Use

The concrete apron at each overhead door access point is the transition between the paved/aggregate yard and the building interior. These aprons must:
- Support the full weight of vehicles entering and exiting (including fire apparatus and graders).
- Resist freeze-thaw cycles at the door threshold where snowmelt and water accumulation are common.
- Resist sulphate exposure from sub-base and subgrade materials.
- Be dimensioned to extend beyond the door footprint to capture the loaded zone before vehicles enter the building.

Apron dimensions must consider the vehicle swept path — for wide equipment (graders up to 8'2" wide, tandem trucks up to 8'9" wide), aprons will need to be significantly wider than the door opening to capture the full turning/approach zone.

## Considerations

### ESAL Calculation Responsibility

The design ESAL (Equivalent Single Axle Load) count for each zone is the Design-Builder's responsibility. The Geotechnical Investigation Report provides cross-sections for reference ESAL categories (100k, 800k, 2×10^6 ESALs). The Design-Builder must:
1. Estimate the 20-year traffic volume per zone.
2. Apply appropriate vehicle equivalency factors for the equipment mix.
3. Select the appropriate cross-section category.

For the fire apparatus routing (Zone A): given that fire apparatus are very heavy per axle (Type 1 engines commonly exceed 20,000 kg GVW) and trips will be frequent (multiple daily responses plus training), ESAL accumulation will likely place Zone A at the 800,000 ESAL threshold or above over the design life.

For the heavy equipment yard (Zone C): aggregate surfacing is appropriate per OSR, so ESAL calculations for formal pavement design are not required; however, depth and compaction design should be informed by the heaviest anticipated equipment.

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Tables 8.1 and 8.2; OSR Appendix B.

### Concrete Apron Reinforcing

The Geotechnical Investigation Report specifies concrete mix requirements but does not prescribe reinforcing (slab thickness, rebar, jointing). Structural design of the concrete aprons (slab thickness for vehicle loading, joint spacing to control cracking, dowel bars at joints) is the Design-Builder's responsibility and must be performed by a structural engineer.

Source: ASSUMPTION — reinforcing not addressed in Geotech Report Section 8; standard civil/structural practice requires structural engineer involvement for vehicle-loaded slabs.

### Transition Zones

Where Zone A (heavy duty asphalt) meets Zone C (aggregate), and where Zone B (light duty asphalt) meets Zone D (concrete apron), transition design (edge support, curbs or ramps, drainage) must be addressed in the drawings to prevent edge failure and differential settlement.

Source: ASSUMPTION — standard civil design practice; not explicitly stated in OSR.

### Cold Storage Building

If the Cold Storage building has overhead doors, those access points also require concrete aprons per OSR §10.3.10. Confirm with architectural drawings which buildings have overhead doors. The cold storage building is a separate structure and its overhead door count and locations are TBD until architectural design is advanced.

Source: OSR §10.3.10 ("all overhead door access points to the facility"); ASSUMPTION: "facility" includes all buildings on site.

### CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Reference Provenance

The Specification and Datasheet reference CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 for both sulphate exposure class (S-2) and freeze-thaw exposure requirements. However, these requirements are derived from the Geotechnical Investigation Report's interpretation of the standard -- the full CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 text has not been directly accessed for this deliverable.

Implications:
- The sulphate class S-2 requirements (Type HS cement, 32 MPa at 56 days, max w/c 0.45) are well-established and unlikely to change upon direct standard review.
- The freeze-thaw exposure class has not been confirmed (specific class F-1 or F-2 per Table 1 of the standard is TBD). The applicable class determines required air content and may affect mix design.
- Until the full standard is directly consulted, all CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 references should be treated as having **second-hand provenance** and confirmed by the concrete design engineer.

### Coordination Interface: DEL-03-02 Grading, Earthworks, Drainage & Stormwater

Multiple documents within this deliverable reference the "site grading deliverable" or "site drainage infrastructure" generically. The specific deliverable is DEL-03-02 Grading, Earthworks, Drainage & Stormwater (PKG-003). All cross-references should use this deliverable ID for precise traceability. Key interface points include:
- REQ-03-03-11 (drainage cross slopes) directs runoff to drainage infrastructure designed in DEL-03-02.
- Procedure prerequisites reference "site grading deliverable" for finished grade levels.
- Pavement subgrade elevations must be coordinated with DEL-03-02 grading design.

### Hold Points and Inspection Points

The Procedure defines geotechnical engineer sign-off after proof rolling (Step B-1) as a clear hold point -- work cannot proceed without explicit approval. However, the distinction between **mandatory hold points** and **routine inspection points** is not articulated for subsequent construction steps.

The following should be considered for hold point designation:
- Before HMA paving (Step B-6): confirm base course elevation and compaction are acceptable before irreversible paving.
- Before concrete apron pour (Step B-5): confirm formwork, reinforcing, and subgrade/sub-base are inspected and approved before irreversible concrete placement.
- Before aggregate yard final grading (Step B-4): confirm compacted depth meets design requirements.

The rationale for hold points is that they protect against proceeding past a critical checkpoint where deficiencies would require costly demolition to correct. Hold points should be distinguished from inspection points (where work may proceed while awaiting test results, provided the contractor has confidence in compliance).

### Design Life Alignment

The main building has a 50-year design life per project context. Pavement surfaces typically have a maintenance cycle much shorter than 50 years (asphalt resurfacing is common at 15–20 year intervals). The pavement design documents should acknowledge:
- Expected maintenance intervals (resurfacing schedule).
- Where pavement elevation or drainage design accommodates future resurfacing lifts.
- Whether aggregate yard areas will be upgraded to asphalt in the future and whether subbase is designed to accommodate that.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Aggregate vs. Asphalt for Equipment Yard

**Tension:** A full asphalt surface for the equipment yard would provide better dust control, easier maintenance, and a more finished appearance versus the aggregate specified in OSR §10.3.7.

**Resolution:** OSR §10.3.7 explicitly requires aggregate (not asphalt) for the heavy equipment yard. The resolution is that aggregate is the Owner's stated preference and the Design-Builder is bound by it.

**Rationale:** Aggregate allows greater flexibility for yard reconfiguration, is less susceptible to damage from tracked equipment (which can crack asphalt), and is more economical. The dust control trade-off may be mitigated by aggregate gradation selection and periodic watering in summer — but this is an operational consideration, not a design one.

### Trade-off 2: Pavement Section Conservatism vs. Cost

**Tension:** Applying the 550 mm heavy-duty section (Table 8.2) to all paved areas would maximize durability and eliminate uncertainty about ESAL classification. However, it would increase material volume and cost substantially.

**Resolution:** Zone-differentiated design per OSR §10.3.7 is appropriate — use 425 mm (Zone B) and 450 mm (Zone A) and reserve 550 mm for any areas where ESAL analysis confirms collector-road-equivalent loading.

**Rationale:** The geotechnical recommendations are site-specific and well-founded on the Mr = 45,000 kPa subgrade. Applying the zone-differentiated approach respects the engineering rationale without excessive conservatism.

### Trade-off 3: Concrete Apron Extent vs. Cost

**Tension:** Larger aprons extend further from the building, increasing cost, but provide a better transition between paved and aggregate/asphalt zones and reduce the risk of damage at the edge of the concrete.

**Resolution:** Apron dimensions should be set to capture the full vehicle "at rest" position under the overhead door, plus a reasonable transition zone (ASSUMPTION: minimum 1.5 m beyond door footprint on each side, minimum 6 m depth from door face; subject to structural design confirmation).

**Rationale:** Undersized aprons that end before the vehicle is fully clear of the door are quickly damaged as vehicles straddle the concrete-asphalt/aggregate joint at load.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority (PROPOSAL) | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-001 | Geofabric placement position: Datasheet cross-section tables list geotextile as the bottom layer (below SGSB, i.e., at subgrade/SGSB interface), while Procedure Step B-2 line 5 states geofabric installation "at SGSB/Base interface" (above SGSB). These are different layer positions with different functions (separation vs. reinforcement). | Datasheet.md — Pavement Cross-Section: Light Duty; Heavy Duty | Procedure.md — Step B-2, line 5 | Datasheet cross-sections; Procedure Step B-2; Specification REQ-03-03-12 | Geotechnical engineer (confirm intended placement position per Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8) | TBD |
| CONF-002 | Aggregate yard compaction standard: Specification REQ-03-03-05 and Procedure Step B-4 both specify 98% SPDD for aggregate yard (not 100% SPDD like SGSB/Base). The Datasheet Compaction Standards table has been updated to include a separate row for "Aggregate yard (Zone C)" at 98% SPDD for clarity and to prevent misapplication of the 100% standard. | Specification.md — REQ-03-03-05 (98% SPDD) | Datasheet.md — Compaction Standards table (now includes aggregate yard row) | Datasheet Compaction Standards; Specification REQ-03-03-05; Procedure Step B-4 | Specification.md (REQ-03-03-05 is the authoritative source for 98% SPDD) | RESOLVED: Datasheet row added; Specification and Procedure aligned at 98% SPDD |

## Examples

### Example: ESAL Classification for Fire Apparatus Routing (Zone A)

- Fire hall expected to respond 200–500 times/year (ASSUMPTION based on a small municipal fire hall; actual call volume to be confirmed with Owner).
- Each response is one pass out and one pass back = 2 passes per call.
- At 500 calls/year × 2 passes × ~20 years = 20,000 passes minimum.
- A Type 1 engine at ~20,000 kg GVW with two rear axles generates significant ESAL per pass (typically 3–10 ESALs per pass depending on axle loads).
- At 10 ESALs/pass: 20,000 passes × 10 = 200,000 ESALs over 20 years — within the 800,000 ESAL Zone A threshold.
- However, if additional vehicles (training, mutual aid, public works trucks), this approaches the threshold faster.
- **Recommendation:** Design Zone A to the 800,000 ESAL (450 mm) cross-section minimum; the Design-Builder's pavement engineer should confirm with actual ESAL calculations.

### Example: Overhead Door Apron Width Calculation

- Grader width: 8'2" ≈ 2.5 m. Door opening for equipment storage bays: typically 4.3–5.5 m wide.
- Apron must be at minimum as wide as the door opening; ideally ≥ 1.0 m wider than the vehicle on each side for alignment tolerance.
- For a 4.5 m door with a 2.5 m wide grader: apron should be ≥ 4.5 m wide (minimum = door width).
- For a tandem truck at 8'9" ≈ 2.7 m width approaching the door: if turning is involved, swept path analysis should govern apron extent.
