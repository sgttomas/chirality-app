### Pavement Design Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Design method | AASHTO 1993 | Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8 |
| Design Resilient Modulus (Mr) | 45,000 kPa (45 MPa) | Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8 |
| Seasonal adjustment factor | 0.36 | Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8 |
| Frost penetration depth | 2.0 m | Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 5.5 |

### Pavement Cross-Section: Light Duty Asphalt (100,000 ESALs)

| Layer | Material | Thickness |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Surface course | Hot Mix Asphalt Concrete (HMAC) | 75 mm |
| Base course | Crushed Granular Base | 150 mm |
| Sub-grade sub-base (SGSB) | Granular Sub-base | 200 mm |
| Geotextile | Woven geofabric (min 900 N grab tensile strength) | — |
| **Total (excluding geotextile)** | | **425 mm** |

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Table 8.1

**Geofabric Placement Note:** The layer position of the woven geofabric requires clarification. This cross-section table lists geotextile below the SGSB layer (i.e., at the subgrade/SGSB interface), consistent with its function as a separation/filtration layer. However, Procedure Step B-2 line 5 describes installation "at SGSB/Base interface" (above SGSB). These are different layer positions with different functions. The geotechnical engineer must confirm the correct placement position. See Guidance Conflict Table, Conflict ID CONF-001. [Enriched per A-004]

### Pavement Cross-Section: Heavy Duty Asphalt (800,000 ESALs)

| Layer | Material | Thickness |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Surface course | Hot Mix Asphalt Concrete (HMAC) | 100 mm |
| Base course | Crushed Granular Base | 150 mm |
| Sub-grade sub-base (SGSB) | Granular Sub-base | 200 mm |
| Geotextile | Woven geofabric (min 900 N grab tensile strength) | — |

### Pavement Cross-Section: Industrial/Collector Route (2,000,000 ESALs)

**Applicability Note:** This cross-section is not assigned to a specific surfacing zone in the Surfacing Zone Summary above. It is a conditional fallback for Zone A (fire apparatus routing) if the Design-Builder's ESAL analysis exceeds 800,000 ESALs and approaches 2,000,000 ESALs. See Specification REQ-03-03-04 Note for the conditional trigger. [Enriched per B-002; source: Specification.md REQ-03-03-04 Note; Geotechnical Investigation Report, Table 8.2]
