# Deliverable: DEL-03-03 Pavements, Aggregate Yard Areas & Concrete Aprons

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to establish the load-differentiated surfacing design basis for a multi-use public services site, ensuring that each surface zone (heavy asphalt, light asphalt, aggregate yard, concrete aprons) is structurally matched to its anticipated loading while accounting for adverse subgrade, frost, and sulphate conditions. It must carry the knowledge of how surfacing type selection, pavement cross-section design, subgrade quality controls, and material specifications integrate to produce a durable, zone-differentiated site surface system.
