## Steps

### Phase A: Pavement Design Development (Proposal / Design Phase)

**Step A-1: Establish Surfacing Zone Boundaries**

Using the architectural site plan and facility program:
1. Identify the direct fire apparatus routing from apparatus bays to Waskasoo Avenue — this defines Zone A (heavy duty asphalt).
2. Identify parking areas near the main structure — these define Zone B (light duty asphalt).
3. Designate all remaining site areas likely used for heavy equipment travel as Zone C (aggregate yard).
4. Confirm all overhead door locations on all buildings (main PSB, cold storage, etc.) — all thresholds define Zone D (concrete aprons). Note: Overhead door locations from architectural deliverables — confirm source from PKG-002 (PSB) and/or PKG-004 (cold storage). [Enriched per X-001]
5. Produce a surfacing zone plan drawing for review.

**Step A-2: ESAL Calculation per Zone**

For each paved zone (A and B):
1. Estimate annual traffic volume (vehicle trips per year) by vehicle class.
2. Apply ESAL equivalency factors for each vehicle class (per AASHTO 1993).
3. Sum ESALs over the design period (minimum 20 years ASSUMPTION; confirm with geotechnical engineer).
4. Assign the appropriate pavement cross-section from Geotechnical Investigation Report Tables 8.1/8.2:
   - 100,000 ESALs → 425 mm (HMAC 75 + Base 150 + SGSB 200)
   - 800,000 ESALs → 450 mm (HMAC 100 + Base 150 + SGSB 200)
   - 2,000,000 ESALs → 550 mm (HMAC 100 + Base 200 + SGSB 250)

**Step A-3: Concrete Apron Structural Design**

For each overhead door access point (Zone D):
1. Determine design vehicle (heaviest vehicle regularly using each specific door).
2. Structural engineer to calculate slab thickness for vehicle load (static and dynamic loading), frost heave forces, and long-term settlement.
3. Design reinforcing layout (rebar size, spacing, concrete cover).
4. Specify joint locations (control joints, construction joints, dowels at door threshold).
5. Specify concrete mix: Class S-2, Type HS cement, 32 MPa at 56 days, max w/c 0.45.
6. Determine apron plan dimensions based on vehicle swept path analysis.

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8; OSR §10.3.10.

**Step A-4: Produce Design Documents**

Compile the following deliverable documents:
1. Pavement design report (ESAL calculations, subgrade parameters, cross-section selection per zone, design assumptions).
2. Surfacing zone plan (drawing — plan view of all zones A, B, C, D).
3. Pavement cross-section details (typical sections for each zone, dimensions and materials labelled).
4. Concrete apron details (plan per door location, cross-section with reinforcing, mix specification).
5. Aggregate yard specification (material, gradation, depth, compaction).
6. Subgrade preparation and proof rolling protocol (construction specification).

**Step A-5: Internal Design Review**

1. Civil/pavement engineer reviews all pavement cross-sections against Geotech Report recommendations.
2. Structural engineer reviews and stamps concrete apron drawings.
3. Project manager confirms all overhead door locations captured.
4. Confirm consistency between surfacing zone plan, grading plan, and site utility plan.
5. Address any conflicts (e.g., pavement elevations conflicting with grading, apron grades affecting building drainage).

### Phase B: Construction Implementation

**Step B-1: Subgrade Preparation**

1. Strip and remove organic topsoil layer from all Zone A, B, C, and D footprints.
2. Rough-grade subgrade to design elevations per site grading plan.
3. Compact subgrade to 98% SPDD (ASTM D698) within ±2% of optimum moisture content.
4. Perform proof rolling: minimum two passes of a single-axle 80 kN dual-wheel truck in all pavement areas. Geotechnical engineer must be present to observe.
5. Identify and mark any soft/yielding zones during proof rolling.
6. Over-excavate soft zones to firm material and replace with structural fill (compacted to 100% SPDD). Geotechnical engineer to confirm remediation depth.
7. Obtain geotechnical engineer sign-off before proceeding with SGSB placement.

**Geotechnical Engineer Sign-Off Scope Note:** Step B-1 requires geotechnical sign-off for subgrade acceptance before SGSB placement. The scope of required geotechnical inspection/approval for subsequent layers is TBD. Confirm whether the geotechnical engineer must also inspect and approve:
- SGSB compaction results before base course placement (Step B-2 to B-3 transition)
- Base course compaction results before HMA paving (Step B-3 to B-6 transition)
- Aggregate yard compaction and depth before acceptance (Step B-4 completion)
- Sub-base preparation under concrete aprons before formwork/pour (Step B-5)

See Guidance "Hold Points and Inspection Points" section for rationale. [Enriched per D-001]

**Step B-2: SGSB Layer Placement (Zones A and B)**

1. Place granular sub-base (SGSB) material in maximum 200 mm lifts.
2. Compact each lift to 100% SPDD (ASTM D698).
3. Perform nuclear density gauge or sand cone testing at minimum frequency specified in construction quality plan (ASSUMPTION: minimum one test per 500 m² per lift).
4. Maintain minimum 2% cross slope throughout.
5. Install woven geofabric (min 900 N grab tensile strength) at location per geotechnical engineer direction (Note: see Guidance Conflict Table CONF-001 — geofabric placement position requires confirmation: Datasheet cross-sections indicate subgrade/SGSB interface; Procedure references SGSB/Base interface. Geotechnical engineer must confirm correct position before installation.).

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8; REQ-03-03-10.

**Step B-3: Granular Base Course Placement (Zones A and B)**

1. Place crushed granular base course material.
2. Compact to 100% SPDD (ASTM D698).
3. Perform compaction testing (same frequency as SGSB).
4. Install biaxial geogrid if required by cross-section (Zone A heavy duty, or where ESAL analysis triggers Table 8.2 section).
5. Check finished base elevation relative to design surface elevation to ensure correct HMAC thickness can be achieved.

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Section 8; REQ-03-03-03/04.

**Step B-4: Aggregate Yard Surfacing Placement (Zone C)**

1. Place 80 mm minus pit run gravel meeting City of Red Deer gradation (Geotech Report Table 7.1).
2. Place and compact in lifts; compact each lift to 98% SPDD.
3. Achieve design compacted depth as specified in pavement design report.
4. Shape to minimum 2% cross slope for drainage.
5. Confirm gradation by sieve analysis (ASSUMPTION: one test per material source and/or per 1,000 m³ placed).

Source: Geotechnical Investigation Report, Tables 7.1 and Section 8; REQ-03-03-05.

**Step B-5: Concrete Apron Construction (Zone D)**

1. Prepare subgrade for apron areas per Step B-1 (included in proof rolling scope).
2. Place and compact crushed granular sub-base under apron (depth per structural drawings).
3. Install formwork for apron perimeter and joint locations.
4. Install reinforcing steel as per structural engineer's drawings (rebar, dowels, cover specifications).
5. Install vapour barrier/isolation membrane if specified at door threshold.
6. Place concrete: sulphate-resistant mix (Type HS cement, 32 MPa at 56 days, max w/c 0.45).
   - Take minimum 3 test cylinders per truck/batch (for 7-day, 28-day, 56-day breaks).
   - Record batch plant ticket for each truck (verify cement type, water content, slump).
7. Finish surface: broom finish for skid resistance; slope min 1% away from building wall (ASSUMPTION: standard practice to drain away from door threshold).
8. Apply curing compound immediately after finishing; maintain curing for minimum 7 days.
9. Saw-cut control joints per structural drawings within 24 hours of placement (if not formed joints).
10. Protect concrete from frost during cold weather (Penhold design frost depth 2.0 m — winter concrete protection required per CSA A23.1 cold weather concreting provisions).

**Step B-6: HMA Paving (Zones A and B)**

1. Inspect and accept granular base course surface (check level, compaction, cleanliness) before paving.
2. Apply tack coat (emulsified asphalt) to base course surface.
3. Pave HMAC in single lift for light duty (75 mm), or in two lifts (base course HMAC + wearing course) for heavy duty (100 mm total) — lift configuration per pavement design report.
4. Compact HMA immediately after placement; achieve minimum 97% of 75-blow Marshall Density.
5. Perform nuclear density testing on each lot per HMAC specification.
6. Check cross slopes with level or survey instrument; verify minimum 2% maintained.
7. Protect adjacent concrete aprons from HMAC equipment damage during paving.
8. **Cold Weather HMA Paving Restrictions:** Do not place HMA when ambient air temperature is below TBD (ASSUMPTION: typically 10 degrees C minimum for HMA placement per standard practice) or when the receiving surface temperature is below TBD (ASSUMPTION: typically 5 degrees C minimum). HMA placed below minimum temperatures will not achieve adequate compaction and will result in premature pavement failure. Confirm temperature thresholds per the applicable HMA material specification and the project Construction Weather Restrictions specification. [Enriched per F-003]
