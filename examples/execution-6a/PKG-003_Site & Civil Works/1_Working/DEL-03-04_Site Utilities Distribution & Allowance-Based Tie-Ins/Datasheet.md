## Attributes

### Utility Types In Scope

The following utility services require site distribution and/or tie-in coordination for the Public Services Building project:

| Utility | Existing Stub / Proximity | Invert Elevation / Depth | Pipe Diameter / Conduit Size | Service Capacity | Utility Provider | Notes |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Water | Stubbed at site corner | TBD (post-award, from Owner-provided drawings) | TBD | TBD | TBD — confirm with Town of Penhold | Source: Addendum 03 §1.6 |
| Wastewater (sanitary sewer) | Stubbed at site corner | TBD (post-award, from Owner-provided drawings) | TBD | TBD | TBD — confirm with Town of Penhold | Source: Addendum 03 §1.6 |
| Electrical | Within a few feet of the site | TBD (post-award, from Owner-provided drawings) | TBD | TBD | TBD — confirm with local electrical utility | Source: Addendum 03 §1.6 |
| Communications (telecom/data) | Within a few feet of the site | TBD (post-award, from Owner-provided drawings) | TBD | TBD | TBD — confirm with applicable telecom provider(s) | Source: Addendum 03 §1.6 |
| Natural gas | Within a few feet of the site | TBD (post-award, from Owner-provided drawings) | TBD | TBD | TBD — confirm with gas provider (e.g., ATCO Gas — **ASSUMPTION**) | Source: Addendum 03 §1.6 |

> **Note (B-001):** Invert elevation/depth, pipe diameter/conduit size, and service capacity are essential factual data for routing design. These will be available from Owner-provided underground services drawings after contract award (OSR §10.3.2). Placeholders are included as TBD pending receipt of that information.

> **Note (B-003):** Confirmed Utility Provider names for each service type are TBD. Provider identification is essential for coordination planning. Procedure step B2 references examples (e.g., ATCO Gas, Town of Penhold) but these are assumptions pending confirmation during design phase.

### Allowance Structure

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Tie-in allowance type | Cash allowance |
| Included in base proposal price? | No — excluded from base price |
| Allowance dollar value pre-set? | No — value not pre-set (DEC-004) |
| DB responsibility after conditions confirmed | Design coordination and execution (SOW-0110) |

### Buildings Receiving Utility Services

**Scope Clarification (E-001):** This deliverable addresses utility services for exactly **two buildings**: the Main Public Services Building (PSB) and the Cold Storage Building (60' x 100'). The Pickled Sand Storage Building was removed from project scope per Addendum 03 §1.2 and is excluded.

Utility distribution must serve both remaining buildings. Source: Addendum 03 §1.2 (scope removal); OSR §10.2 (scope includes Main PSB and Cold Storage Building).

#### Cold Storage Building — Utility Service Requirements

| Utility | Required for Cold Storage Building? | Estimated Load / Sizing | Notes |
|---------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Water | TBD | TBD | ASSUMPTION: Cold storage may require water for wash-down or fire suppression; to be confirmed during design |
| Wastewater (sanitary sewer) | TBD | TBD | ASSUMPTION: May be needed depending on water service inclusion |
| Electrical | Yes — ASSUMPTION: lighting and electrical plugs required | TBD | OSR §10.2 references "lighting and electrical plugs" for the sand/salt shed; Cold Storage Building has similar basic needs |
| Communications (telecom/data) | TBD | TBD | ASSUMPTION: May not be required for an unheated storage building; to be confirmed |
| Natural gas | TBD | TBD | ASSUMPTION: Cold storage is unheated per OSR §10.2; gas service likely not required unless heating is added |

> **Note (B-002):** The Datasheet previously noted both buildings must be served but did not enumerate which utilities are required specifically for the Cold Storage Building. The table above captures known and TBD requirements per building to ensure comprehensive coverage. Confirmed requirements will depend on design development.

### Anticipated Artifacts

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Utility distribution plan | Drawings/diagrams showing routing from municipal stubs to each building |
| Utility provider coordination | Log/correspondence record of coordination with each Utility Provider |
| Allowance management plan (tie-ins) | Document describing how the cash allowance will be tracked, managed, and drawn against |
| Service activation coordination | Plan for sequencing service activation from each provider at project handover |

## Conditions

### Site Conditions (from sources)

| Condition | Detail | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Site location | Lot 1, Block 1, Plan 212 1668; N.W. ¼ SEC. 6-37-27 W4M, Penhold, Alberta | RFP §10.3.1 (OSR) |
| Total parcel area | ~20 acres | Addendum 03 §1.1 |
| Developable area | ~12 acres (remainder after storm retention pond and dog park in flood fringe) | Addendum 03 §1.1 |
| Underground services drawings | DB to be provided existing drawings showing underground services adjacent to the site and within the municipal street after award | OSR §10.3.2 |
| Survey files | DB to be provided survey files from the civil engineering firm after award | Addendum 03 §1.20 |

### Constraints

- Utility tie-ins (tie-in to municipal stubs and distribution to buildings) are explicitly excluded from the base proposal price and treated as a cash allowance (DEC-004; Addendum 03 §§1.6–1.7).
- DB remains responsible for design coordination and execution of tie-ins once site conditions are confirmed (SOW-0110).
- DB to be provided with existing underground services drawings showing services adjacent to site and within the municipal street to produce site servicing drawings (OSR §10.3.2 / location TBD in OSR).
- All civil design and construction drawings must meet OSR requirements, applicable codes and standards, and good construction practice (OSR §10.3.2 / location TBD).

## Construction

### Execution Approach (inferred from sources)

ASSUMPTION: The utility distribution work involves two distinct phases:
1. **Design phase**: Confirming service connection points, routing alignments, trenching/boring requirements, and provider connection standards for each utility type.
2. **Construction phase**: Physical connection from municipal stubs to the buildings, once conditions are confirmed and the allowance mechanism is engaged.

### Coordination Requirements

- Design-Builder must coordinate with each Utility Provider for each service type (water, wastewater, electrical, communications, gas). Source: RFP §7.3.3.
- Coordination includes service applications, provider design reviews, inspection scheduling, and activation sequencing.
- ASSUMPTION: Alberta One-Call (or equivalent) locate requirements apply prior to any excavation.

### Governing Discipline / Responsible Party

- Civil/Utilities engineering lead; procurement and provider-coordination role also required.
- Professional engineer stamp required for civil design documents per RFP quality management requirements (RFP §7.2 / location TBD).
