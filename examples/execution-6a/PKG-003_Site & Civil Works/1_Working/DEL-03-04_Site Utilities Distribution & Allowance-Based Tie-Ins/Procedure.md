## Prerequisites

### Information Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Source | When Available |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Existing underground services drawings (adjacent to site and within municipal street) | To be provided by Owner after contract award | Post-award |
| Survey files from civil engineering firm | To be provided by Owner after contract award (Addendum 03 §1.20) | Post-award |
| Geotechnical investigation report | Appendix D of RFP — available during proposal phase | Proposal phase |
| Addendum 03 §§1.6–1.7 — stub location and allowance confirmation | Accessible | Available now |
| Town of Penhold municipal servicing standards | To be obtained from Town | Design phase |
| Utility Provider connection standards and applications | To be obtained from each provider | Design phase |

### Declared Upstream Dependencies (A-004)

No formal blocking dependencies declared in `_DEPENDENCIES.md`. However, the following PKG-003 deliverables should be coordinated during design:
- **DEL-03-01 (Site Plan)** — building locations and site layout affect utility routing; coordination ensures consistency
- **DEL-03-02 (Grading and Stormwater)** — grading design affects trench depths, grades, and positive drainage requirements; must align with utility trench design
These are procedural prerequisites for successful utility design finalization but are expected to progress in parallel rather than strictly sequential. Documented coordination between these deliverables should be recorded in the design file (BIM or drawing markup).

### Personnel Prerequisites

- Civil/Utilities Engineer (P.Eng. registered in Alberta) — responsible for site servicing drawings
- Procurement/coordination lead — responsible for Utility Provider correspondence
- Project Manager — responsible for allowance management oversight

## Steps

### Phase A — Proposal Preparation

**A1. Confirm allowance scope and approach in proposal narrative.**
- State explicitly that utility service tie-in costs are excluded from the base proposal price and treated as a cash allowance per DEC-004 and Addendum 03 §1.7.
- Describe the DB's preliminary understanding of utility stub locations (water/wastewater at site corner; electrical, communications, gas within a few feet of site) per Addendum 03 §1.6.
- Source: DEC-004; Addendum 03 §§1.6–1.7.

**A2. Develop preliminary utility routing concept.**
- Using available information (site plan, grading drawings in Appendix E, geotechnical report in Appendix D), prepare a preliminary utility routing concept showing approximate alignment for each utility from stubs to each building.
- Label as preliminary — to be confirmed after award using Owner-provided underground services drawings.
- Source: OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD); Addendum 03 §1.20.

**A3. Describe provider coordination approach in proposal.**
- Identify each Utility Provider that will need to be engaged (municipal water/wastewater authority, electrical utility, gas utility, telecom/communications provider).
- Describe the DB's coordination process (early contact, application submission, review and approval, inspection scheduling, activation).
- Source: RFP §7.3.3; SOW-0109.

**A4. Describe allowance management approach in proposal.**
- Briefly describe how the DB will track and manage costs against the cash allowance (e.g., cost log per utility, drawdown request process, Owner/PM approval mechanism).
- Source: DEC-004; SOW-0110.

### Phase B — Post-Award Design Development

**B1. Request and receive Owner-provided information.**
- Upon contract award, formally request from the Owner: (a) existing underground services drawings showing services adjacent to site and within the municipal street, and (b) survey files from the civil engineering firm.
- Source: OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD); Addendum 03 §1.20.

**B2. Engage each Utility Provider.**
- Submit service applications to each Utility Provider (water/wastewater — Town of Penhold or applicable authority; electrical — local utility; gas — ATCO Gas or applicable provider; communications — applicable telecom provider(s)).
- Obtain provider design standards and connection requirements.
- ASSUMPTION: Applications must be submitted early given potential lead times.

**B3. Finalize utility routing and distribution design.**
- Using Owner-provided underground services drawings and survey files, finalize routing alignments, trench depths, service sizing, and connection details for each utility type.
- Ensure positive drainage away from all buildings is maintained in trench design (consistent with OSR grading requirements).
- Prepare site servicing drawings (utility distribution plan) sealed by P.Eng.
- Source: OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD); RFP §7.2 Quality Management (p. 20).

**B4. Confirm permit requirements.**
- Identify all permits required for utility connections (e.g., excavation permits, electrical service permits, gas line permits, AHJ inspections).
- Obtain, manage, and pay for required permits and inspections.
- ASSUMPTION: Permit costs may be included within the cash allowance or separately tracked — TBD based on Owner direction. Reference: SOW-0009 (permits and inspections coordination).

**B5. Issue Allowance Management Plan.**
- Produce the Allowance Management Plan (tie-ins) document:
  - Scope of work covered by the allowance
  - Cost tracking mechanism (log per utility type)
  - Drawdown request and Owner/PM approval process
  - Reporting frequency
- Review with Owner/PM and obtain approval of the management approach.
- Source: DEC-004; SOW-0110; _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts.

### Phase B.5 — Design Readiness Gate (F-003)

**B5. Validate design readiness before proceeding to construction.**
- Confirm that the following conditions are satisfied before issuing the Notice to Proceed for construction Phase C:
  - (a) Owner-provided drawings received and reviewed (100% DD utility distribution plan complete and stamped)
  - (b) Provider design approvals obtained in writing for each utility type (REQ-01 compliance verification complete)
  - (c) All permits applied for and approved or on track for approval before construction start date
  - (d) Allowance Management Plan approved by Owner/PM (REQ-09 verification complete)
  - (e) Site servicing drawings reviewed against Owner-provided underground services drawings to confirm no conflicts with existing services (X-003 verification requirement)
- If any condition is not satisfied, do not proceed to Phase C; issue a readiness hold notice to Owner/PM with required corrective actions and revised completion dates.
- Document the readiness gate sign-off (a brief check form or email confirmation from Owner/PM and Civil/Utilities Engineer).
- Source: F-003 (Semantic Lensing); standard gating practice for design-to-construction transition.

### Phase C — Construction Execution

**C1. Execute utility trench and connection work.**
- Conduct all required locates (Alberta One-Call or equivalent) prior to excavation. This is a legal requirement under Alberta provincial regulations, not a discretionary practice (REQ-12).
- Execute trenching, bedding, pipe/conduit installation, and backfill for each utility service in accordance with IFC drawings, provider standards, applicable codes, and good construction practice. Trench backfill and compaction shall comply with REQ-13 (minimum compaction percentage and testing).
- Source: REQ-06, REQ-12, REQ-13 (Specification); OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD).

**C2. Coordinate provider inspections and connections.**
- Arrange and facilitate provider-side inspections, metering installation, and physical connection to the municipal stubs for each utility type.
- Maintain a coordination log documenting all interactions, submissions, inspections, and final approvals for each provider. This log is a key evidence item for REQ-01 verification.
- For each provider, record: (i) request/application date, (ii) provider response date, (iii) inspection date(s), (iv) any deficiencies noted and corrective actions taken, (v) final connection approval/sign-off date.
- Source: SOW-0109; RFP §7.3.3; F-002 (Semantic Lensing — provider design approval as a conformance proof gate).

**C3. Track costs against the cash allowance.**
- Record all costs associated with utility tie-in work against the cash allowance tracking log.
- Submit drawdown requests to Owner/PM per the approved Allowance Management Plan process.
- Source: DEC-004; SOW-0110.

### Phase D — Service Activation and Commissioning

**D1. Coordinate service activation timing.**
- Schedule activation of each utility service with the respective provider, coordinated with the overall project commissioning and occupancy readiness timeline.
- ASSUMPTION: Activation should be completed prior to substantial performance to allow building systems testing.
- Source: RFP §7.5 (p. 24); implied by operational readiness requirements.

**D2. Test and verify each service.**
- Confirm each utility service (water pressure/flow, sanitary drainage, electrical energization, gas pressure test, communications signal) is operational and meets service requirements.
- Record test results in the service activation coordination record.
- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts (service activation coordination).

**D3. Obtain AHJ sign-offs and utility confirmations.**
- Obtain all required Safety Codes Officer sign-offs and Utility Provider confirmations that connections are complete and accepted.
- ASSUMPTION: Required before occupancy permit can be issued.

---

### Phase E — Closeout

**E1. Compile utility provider coordination record.**
- Assemble complete record of all Utility Provider correspondence, applications, approvals, and inspection certificates for each utility type.
- Include in the project closeout package.
- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; RFP §7.5 (As-Built and O&M documentation).

**E2. Provide as-built inputs for utility connections.**
- Record actual as-constructed locations, depths, and connection details for all utility services.
- Provide this information to the surveyor for inclusion in the certified as-built legal/topographical survey.
- Source: RFP §7.4 (p. 24); SOW-0113.

**E3. Close out the allowance.**
- Prepare final allowance reconciliation showing total costs incurred against the cash allowance.
- Submit to Owner/PM for review and final accounting.
- Source: DEC-004; SOW-0110.
