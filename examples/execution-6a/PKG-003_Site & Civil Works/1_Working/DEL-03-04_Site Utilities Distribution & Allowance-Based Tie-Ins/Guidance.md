# Guidance: DEL-03-04 Site Utilities Distribution & Allowance-Based Tie-Ins

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to establish the Design-Builder's approach to connecting the new Public Services Building site to all required municipal utility services — including water, wastewater, electrical power, communications, and natural gas — and to govern the cash allowance mechanism that covers the cost of those connections.

The deliverable serves two interrelated functions:
1. **Technical**: Confirm and document the routing and design for all utility services from existing stubs/connections to the buildings on site.
2. **Commercial**: Manage the cash allowance treatment for utility tie-ins (DEC-004) in a way that is transparent to the Owner, separates these costs from the base proposal price, and preserves the Design-Builder's execution responsibility.

## Principles

### P1 — Design Responsibility Is Unconditional
Even though the cost of utility tie-ins is treated as a cash allowance (excluded from base price), the Design-Builder retains full responsibility for design coordination and execution once site conditions are confirmed. This is a firm requirement, not discretionary. Source: SOW-0110; DEC-004.

### P2 — Coordinate Early with Each Utility Provider
Each Utility Provider (municipal water/wastewater authority, electrical utility, gas utility, telecom/communications provider) has their own application, review, and connection processes. These processes can take weeks to months. Early engagement is essential to avoid schedule impact. ASSUMPTION: best practice for Alberta municipal utility coordination.

> **Defined Term (B-004):** "Utility Provider" (capitalized) is the standard term used throughout this deliverable to refer to any entity that owns, operates, or supplies a utility service to the site. This includes but is not limited to: the Town of Penhold (water/wastewater), the local electrical utility, the gas provider, and telecom/communications provider(s). Use this term consistently across all four documents.

### P3 — Use Existing Information Provided by Owner
The Owner will provide existing drawings showing underground services adjacent to the site and within the municipal street after contract award (OSR §10.3.2 / location TBD), as well as survey files from the civil engineering firm (Addendum 03 §1.20). The Design-Builder should use this information rather than re-surveying unless gaps are identified and clearly costed. Source: OSR §10.3.2; Addendum 03 §1.20.

### P4 — Allowance Management Must Be Transparent
Because the tie-in costs are outside the base price and the allowance value is not pre-set, the Owner and Project Manager will need to understand how these costs are being tracked and how drawdowns against the allowance are requested and approved. The allowance management plan must establish a clear, simple process. ASSUMPTION: Owner will expect a log-based tracking approach consistent with standard change management processes.

### P5 — Service Activation Must Be Coordinated with Project Closeout
Utility services must be live and tested before occupancy. Service activation (particularly for electrical and gas, which require inspections and utility-side energization) can involve AHJ inspections and utility scheduling that are outside the DB's direct control. Activation planning should begin well before the intended occupancy date. Source: RFP §7.5 Substantial Performance (p. 24); implied by operational readiness requirements.

## Considerations

### Existing Stub Locations
Addendum 03 §1.6 confirms that water and wastewater are stubbed at the corner of the site, and electrical, communications, and gas are within a few feet of the site. This means the DB does not need to bring services from a remote location — the stubs are immediately adjacent. This proximity reduces tie-in complexity and risk.

### Cash Allowance Rationale
The Owner agreed to the cash allowance approach (DEC-004) because the cost of pulling services into the building is not always easily estimated before conditions are confirmed (Addendum 03 §1.7). This was a deliberate risk-sharing mechanism, not an oversight. The DB should not attempt to price tie-ins in the base proposal.

### Two Buildings to Serve
ASSUMPTION: Both the Main PSB and the Cold Storage Building require utility connections. The Pickled Sand Storage Building was removed from project scope (Addendum 03 §1.2). The utility distribution plan should address both remaining buildings and show how services are routed and sized to serve each.

### Permit and Inspection Requirements
ASSUMPTION: Utility connections in Alberta require permits and inspections through the relevant Safety Codes Officers (e.g., electrical permits through Alberta Safety Codes Act). Permit fees are to be obtained, managed, and paid by the DB per SOW-0009, though the pricing approach may also be via allowance for utility connections (SOW-0009 cross-reference; location TBD in decomposition).

### Provider Process Variation (D-001)
Different Utility Providers have different connection processes. For example:
- **Municipal water/wastewater (Town of Penhold):** Typically allows the DB to self-perform the tie-in to the municipal stub, but the Town may require their own contractor to complete the final connection to the main line or install specific fittings.
- **Electrical utility:** Most utilities require their own contractors to perform the final energization and metering installation; the DB typically completes the trench/conduit to the service point.
- **Gas (e.g., ATCO Gas):** Often requires their own contractor for the final connection and pressure testing.
- **Telecom:** May allow self-performed fiber/cable installation in the conduit, but may require their technician to perform splicing and testing.

The allowance management plan should clarify with each provider early in design (Phase B) whether the DB or the provider will perform the final connection, as this affects cost estimation and schedule. Source: D-001 (Semantic Lensing).

### Site Access to Underground Services Information
The DB will be provided existing underground services drawings after award (OSR §10.3.2). Until then, exact routing decisions depend on that information. The proposal should acknowledge this dependency and describe the process for finalizing routing once that information is received.

### Minimum Burial Depth (Frost Depth) (C-003)
Utility service lines in Alberta must be installed below the frost penetration depth to avoid freezing and damage. In the Penhold area (central Alberta), typical frost depth is approximately 1.8 meters (6 feet), but this may vary based on local soil conditions and site-specific geotechnical investigation. The Datasheet references the geotechnical investigation report (Appendix D of RFP), which should be reviewed during design to confirm frost depth for the site. All water, gas, and wastewater lines must be installed below this depth unless heated tracing or other protection is provided. This is a critical design parameter that affects trench depth and cost. Source: C-003 (Semantic Lensing); geotechnical best practice for Alberta.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1: Routing Efficiency vs. Separation Requirements
- **Tension**: Consolidating utility trenches (running multiple services in a shared trench) reduces excavation cost but may conflict with separation requirements between utilities (e.g., gas and electrical, water and wastewater).
- **Resolution**: ASSUMPTION — consolidate where permitted by applicable codes and Utility Provider standards; maintain required separation distances. Exact requirements TBD pending review of Town of Penhold and Utility Provider standards.
- **Rationale**: Cost efficiency is important for a budget-sensitive municipal project, but code compliance is non-negotiable.

### Trade-off 2: Early Design Commitment vs. Confirmation of Conditions
- **Tension**: Utility routing design requires committing to trench alignments, depths, and connection points, but the exact conditions at the stubs may not be confirmed until after award and receipt of Owner-provided drawings.
- **Resolution**: The DB's proposal should describe a phased design approach — provide a preliminary routing concept in the proposal; finalize routing in the design development phase after Owner-provided drawings are received.
- **Rationale**: This approach is consistent with the allowance mechanism (costs not pre-set) and the post-award provision of survey files (Addendum 03 §1.20).

### Trade-off 3: Cash Allowance Transparency vs. Administrative Simplicity
- **Tension**: Rigorous allowance tracking (line-by-line cost logs for each utility type) provides Owner transparency but adds administrative burden.
- **Resolution**: ASSUMPTION — a simple allowance tracking log per utility type, with drawdown requests reviewed and approved by the Owner/PM, provides adequate transparency without excessive complexity. Specific format TBD pending Owner direction.
- **Rationale**: Consistent with the project's preference for practical, cost-effective management approaches.

## Additional Considerations

### Cost Estimation and Allowance Budgeting (D-003)
The allowance value is not pre-set (DEC-004), which means the Owner has not established an expected budget for utility tie-ins. The DB should develop preliminary cost estimates for each utility type during the proposal phase (based on best available information from Addendum 03 and the RFP) and present these estimates to the Owner/PM early in design. This helps the Owner understand the expected allowance magnitude and plan accordingly. Estimates should be broken down by utility type and identified as preliminary pending post-award confirmation of conditions. As design develops and exact conditions are confirmed, the DB should refine estimates and communicate revisions to the Owner proactively to avoid surprises at drawdown time. Source: D-003 (Semantic Lensing).

### Dispute Resolution and Overrun Risk (E-002)
The allowance mechanism does not pre-set a dollar value, which creates ambiguity about what happens if actual tie-in costs exceed the Owner's unstated expectations. For example, if utility provider requirements (e.g., specialized conduit, deeper burial depth) result in actual costs significantly higher than preliminary estimates, who bears the overrun — the DB, the Owner, or is there a renegotiation? This is a commercial risk that should be clarified with the Owner early in design. Recommended: establish an Owner-approved budget or cap for the allowance during the 60% DD milestone, and define escalation procedures if actual costs threaten to exceed that cap. Source: E-002 (Semantic Lensing). Owner direction required.

## Examples

TBD — examples of utility distribution plans and allowance management approaches from comparable municipal projects are not available in the current accessible sources. To be developed from DB's project precedents during design.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No conflicts identified between sources in Pass 1/2 for this deliverable. All source information is consistent.

**Note on Semantic Lensing (Pass 3):** Item E-002 regarding dispute resolution and overrun risk identifies a commercial gap that requires Owner direction. This is not a document inconsistency but rather a missing contractual clarification. Recommend raising this issue in pre-design owner coordination meeting.
