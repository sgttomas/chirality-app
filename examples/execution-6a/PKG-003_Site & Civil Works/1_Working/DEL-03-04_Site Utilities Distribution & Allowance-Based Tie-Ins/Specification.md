# Specification: DEL-03-04 Site Utilities Distribution & Allowance-Based Tie-Ins

## Scope

### In Scope

This deliverable covers:

1. **Utility distribution design**: Routing and design of all required utility services from existing municipal stubs/adjacent connections to the Main Public Services Building (PSB) and Cold Storage Building on site.
2. **Utility types**: Water, wastewater (sanitary sewer), electrical power, communications (telecom/data), and natural gas. Source: Addendum 03 §1.7.
3. **Utility provider coordination**: All correspondence, applications, and coordination activities with each Utility Provider required to achieve connections and service activation. Source: RFP §7.3.3.
4. **Allowance management**: Management of the cash allowance mechanism for utility tie-ins (DEC-004), including tracking of costs against the allowance and reporting to the Owner.
5. **Service activation coordination**: Sequencing and coordination of service activation from each provider at or prior to handover/occupancy.
6. **Civil design drawings**: Site servicing drawings produced from existing underground services drawings provided by the Owner. Source: OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD within OSR).

### Out of Scope

- Utility costs are **excluded from the base proposal price** (treated as cash allowance per DEC-004; Addendum 03 §1.7). The dollar value of the allowance is not pre-set.
- Stormwater management on-site (no storm sewer on-site) — addressed under DEL-03-02 (SOW-0106).
- Utility work within the buildings themselves (mechanical/electrical building systems) — addressed under PKG-002 deliverables.
- Pickled Sand Storage Building utility services — that building was removed from project scope per Addendum 03 §1.2.

## Requirements

### REQ-01: Utility Coordination Responsibility
The Design-Builder shall complete and coordinate all required services and utilities connections to the building(s) with the Utility Provider(s). The Design-Builder shall obtain each Utility Provider's specific connection standards and demonstrate compliance with those standards as part of the coordination record.
- Source: RFP §7.3.3 (p. 21); SOW-0109.
- Applies to: water, wastewater, electrical, communications, gas.
- **Note (F-001):** Provider-specific connection standards compliance is required in addition to general coordination correspondence. Evidence of compliance with provider standards shall be part of the verification record (see Verification table, REQ-01 row).

### REQ-02: Scope of Utility Services
The following utility services shall be provided/coordinated:
- (a) Water — tie-in from municipal stub at site corner.
- (b) Wastewater (sanitary sewer) — tie-in from municipal stub at site corner.
- (c) Electrical power — tie-in from service within a few feet of the site.
- (d) Communications (telecom/data) — tie-in from service within a few feet of the site.
- (e) Natural gas — tie-in from service within a few feet of the site.
- Source: Addendum 03 §1.6–§1.7.

### REQ-03: Cash Allowance Treatment for Tie-Ins
Utility service tie-ins (tie-in to municipal stubs and distribution to buildings) shall be treated as a cash allowance and **excluded from the base proposal price**. No dollar value is pre-set.
- Source: Addendum 03 §§1.6–1.7; DEC-004; SOW-0110.

### REQ-04: Design Coordination and Execution Responsibility
Notwithstanding the cash allowance treatment, the Design-Builder remains responsible for design coordination and execution of utility tie-ins once site conditions are confirmed.
- Source: SOW-0110 (Decomposition); DEC-004.

### REQ-05: Site Servicing Drawings
The Design-Builder shall produce site servicing drawings using existing underground services drawings (showing services adjacent to the site and within the municipal street) to be provided by the Owner after contract award.
- Source: OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD).

### REQ-06: Civil Design Standards
All civil design and construction drawings shall meet OSR requirements, applicable codes and standards, and good construction practice.
- Source: OSR §10.3.2 (location TBD); SOW-0104.

### REQ-07: Professional Sealing
All civil design documents (planning, design, and construction drawings) shall be sealed by a professional engineer registered to practice in Alberta.
- Source: RFP §7.2 Quality Management section (p. 20) — general requirement for professional design documents.

### REQ-08: Utility Distribution Plan
A utility distribution plan shall be produced showing routing from each municipal stub/service point to each building on site.
- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; consistent with SOW-0109 and OSR §10.3.2.

### REQ-09: Allowance Management Plan
An allowance management plan shall be produced describing the mechanism for tracking, managing, and drawing against the utility tie-in cash allowance. The plan shall include, at minimum: scope of work covered by the allowance, cost tracking mechanism, drawdown request and approval process, and reporting frequency.
- **Reporting Frequency (F-004):** The reporting frequency shall be no less than monthly or per drawdown event, whichever is more frequent. Owner direction on specific frequency is required.
- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; DEC-004; SOW-0110. ASSUMPTION: specific format requirements for the allowance management plan are TBD pending Owner direction.
- **Note (A-002):** The mandatory format for the allowance management plan is ambiguous — the requirement exists but its prescriptive content is deferred. This could lead to rejected submittals if the Owner has unstated expectations. Clarification of format requirements is recommended early in the design phase.
- **Note (F-004):** Reporting frequency is now specified at a minimum threshold to ensure the Owner receives timely cost information.

### REQ-10: Service Activation Coordination
The Design-Builder shall coordinate service activation with each Utility Provider to ensure all utilities are live and tested prior to or at substantial performance/occupancy.
- Source: _CONTEXT.md Anticipated Artifacts; SOW-0109 (coordination with Utility Providers); RFP §7.3.3. ASSUMPTION: timing requirement (prior to occupancy) inferred from operational readiness requirements.

### REQ-11: As-Built Survey — Service Connections
The certified as-built legal/topographical survey at project completion shall show service connections.
- Source: RFP §7.4 (p. 24); SOW-0113.

### REQ-12: Alberta One-Call Locate Requirement
The Design-Builder shall conduct all required utility locates through Alberta One-Call (or equivalent provincial locate service) prior to any excavation on site. This is a legal requirement under Alberta provincial regulations, not a discretionary practice.
- Source: Alberta provincial law (Alberta Utilities Commission rules and Alberta Safety Codes Act); **specific regulation reference TBD** — to be confirmed with applicable Alberta regulatory authority.
- **Note (X-001):** Alberta One-Call locates prior to excavation are a well-established legal requirement in Alberta. This requirement was previously tagged as an ASSUMPTION in Procedure step C1. Elevated to a binding specification requirement to reflect actual regulatory status.

### REQ-13: Trench Backfill and Compaction Standards
Utility trench backfill and compaction shall comply with applicable standards. The Design-Builder shall specify: (a) backfill material requirements, (b) compaction percentage (minimum — typically 90–95% Standard Proctor per local standards), and (c) compaction testing requirements (density tests at specified intervals) for all utility trenches.
- Source: ASSUMPTION — this is a standard civil engineering requirement for underground utility installation. Specific standards (e.g., Town of Penhold servicing standards, CSA standards for utility-specific installation) are TBD pending review during design.
- **Note (D-002):** Procedure step C1 references "bedding, pipe/conduit installation, and backfill" but no specification requirement previously governed backfill quality. This is a standard civil engineering requirement that was absent.
- **TBD:** Confirm Town of Penhold standard compaction percentage and testing frequency for municipal utility trenches; coordinate with each Utility Provider for provider-specific compaction requirements.
