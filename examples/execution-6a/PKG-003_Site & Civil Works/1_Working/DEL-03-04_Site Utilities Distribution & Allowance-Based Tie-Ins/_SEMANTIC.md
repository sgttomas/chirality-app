# Deliverable: DEL-03-04 Site Utilities Distribution & Allowance-Based Tie-Ins

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the knowledge framework for connecting a new municipal site to required utility services through coordinated design, provider engagement, and transparent allowance-based cost governance. It must carry the knowledge needed to ensure all distribution routing, tie-in execution, and service activation sequencing are properly planned, tracked, and verified across both technical and commercial dimensions.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=1: Resolved Value Orientation * Thorough Directive Span = "comprehensive value direction"
- k=2: Resolved Merit Application * Comprehensive Application Span = "total merit deployment"
- k=3: Definitive Worth Ruling * Comprehensive Judgment Scope = "exhaustive worth finding"
- k=4: Resolved Quality Examination * Comprehensive Audit Scope = "complete quality audit"

L = {comprehensive value direction, total merit deployment, exhaustive worth finding, complete quality audit}

**I(evaluative, completeness, L):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = "total valuation"

Step 2:
- p1 = total valuation * comprehensive value direction = "full worth steering"
- p2 = total valuation * total merit deployment = "exhaustive merit coverage"
- p3 = total valuation * exhaustive worth finding = "thorough value accounting"
- p4 = total valuation * complete quality audit = "comprehensive quality review"

Step 3: Centroid of {full worth steering, exhaustive merit coverage, thorough value accounting, comprehensive quality review} --> u = "Exhaustive Value Accounting"

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
- k=1: Resolved Value Orientation * Harmonized Directional Coherence = "aligned value coherence"
- k=2: Resolved Merit Application * Principled Practice Reliability = "reliable merit practice"
- k=3: Definitive Worth Ruling * Principled Adjudication Coherence = "coherent worth adjudication"
- k=4: Resolved Quality Examination * Principled Audit Coherence = "principled quality coherence"

L = {aligned value coherence, reliable merit practice, coherent worth adjudication, principled quality coherence}

**I(evaluative, consistency, L):**

Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = "coherent value"

Step 2:
- p1 = coherent value * aligned value coherence = "unified worth alignment"
- p2 = coherent value * reliable merit practice = "dependable value method"
- p3 = coherent value * coherent worth adjudication = "consistent merit ruling"
- p4 = coherent value * principled quality coherence = "principled value integrity"

Step 3: Centroid of {unified worth alignment, dependable value method, consistent merit ruling, principled value integrity} --> u = "Principled Value Integrity"
