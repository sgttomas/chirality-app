## Requirements

### REQ-3505-001 — Flood Hazard Zone Avoidance (SOW-0114)
The Design-Builder shall design and execute all site works in a manner that respects flood hazard constraints shown on Town of Penhold planning exhibits. Development within the identified floodway is prohibited. Development within the flood fringe shall be designed to avoid impacting the continuity of the floodway.

**Source:** Decomposition §Scope Ledger SOW-0114 (citing Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit; Addendum 03 §1.1); Desktop Environmental Assessment — Table 1 (Ghostpine, June 2021)

---

### REQ-3505-002 — Developable Area Constraint (SOW-0102)
The Design-Builder shall limit building construction to the approximately 12-acre developable area of the 20-acre parcel. The approximately 8-acre area containing the storm retention pond and dog park, both located in the flood fringe, shall not be used for building construction.

**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.1; Decomposition §Scope Ledger SOW-0102

---

### REQ-3505-003 — Flood Hazard Constraints Map
The Design-Builder shall produce a flood hazard constraints map that illustrates:
- The 100-Year Floodway extent relative to the site parcel
- The 100-Year Flood Fringe extent relative to the site parcel
- The developable envelope (approximately 12 acres) and excluded flood fringe areas (approximately 8 acres)
- The proposed building location(s) and site works relative to the flood hazard zones

The map shall be based on Town of Penhold planning exhibits (Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit; Parcel Flood Zone exhibit) and shall be updated to reflect exact floodway/fringe limits confirmed during design.

**Source:** _CONTEXT.md (Anticipated Artifacts); Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit (Penhold/PCPS, Dec. 2022); Parcel Flood Zone exhibit (Town of Penhold)

---

### REQ-3505-004 — Exact Floodway/Fringe Limit Confirmation
The exact floodway/fringe limits shall be confirmed during the design phase in coordination with the Town of Penhold and/or applicable regulatory authorities. The flood hazard constraints map shall be updated once confirmed limits are available.

---

### REQ-3505-005 — Alberta Water Act Approval
Prior to impacting any wetland or waterbody within the project area, the Design-Builder shall obtain approval under the Alberta Water Act (Government of Alberta, 2000) from Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (AEPA; formerly Alberta Environment and Parks [AEP]). The Wetland Assessment and Impact Report (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021) forms the basis of the Water Act application; the Design-Builder shall confirm whether this application is current, has been submitted, and whether approval has been received or conditions have been issued.

**Source:** Wetland Assessment Executive Summary (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021); Alberta Water Act (Government of Alberta, 2000; location TBD — not directly accessed)

---

### REQ-3505-006 — Wetland Replacement Fee
The Design-Builder shall budget for and arrange payment of the ABWRET-A wetland replacement in-lieu fee of $10,769.54 to the Government of Alberta, as determined by the Wetland Assessment and Impact Report. Payment shall be made once Water Act approval is received.

**Note:** This fee value ($10,769.54) is as of August 2021 and may have changed. The current ABWRET-A wetland replacement fee must be confirmed with AEPA prior to payment (TBD -- pending confirmation of current AEPA fee schedule). The value determination is not settled until the current fee is confirmed by AEPA at the time of Water Act approval.

**Source:** Wetland Assessment Executive Summary (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021)

---

### REQ-3505-007 — Wetland/Setback Integration
The Design-Builder shall integrate the delineated wetland and waterbody boundaries (DW01, DW02, DW03, DD01, DD02, and the Anthropogenic Ditch [field code: LC_20210520_045]) and any required setbacks into the site plan. Setback distances from wetland and waterbody boundaries shall be as prescribed by AEPA Water Act approval conditions and/or Town of Penhold development permit conditions. Where setback distances have not yet been prescribed, they shall be recorded as TBD and confirmed prior to design freeze. Site works shall avoid impacting wetland features to the maximum extent practicable.

**Prescriptive Requirements:** Setback distances are not specified in this requirement because they are not yet available. The Design-Builder shall obtain setback distance prescriptions from one or both of the following authorities:
1. Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (AEPA) — as conditions attached to the Water Act approval letter; or
2. Town of Penhold — as conditions attached to the Development Permit or as provisions in the Municipal Development Plan / Land Use Bylaw.

If AEPA and the Town issue conflicting setback requirements, the Design-Builder shall apply the more restrictive setback and document the conflict resolution with the Owner.

**Note:** The source authority for numeric setback distances is the AEPA Water Act approval conditions and/or the Town of Penhold development permit. Until these are issued, specific setback distances remain TBD (see Datasheet.md -- Wetland/Waterbody Setback Distances table). Setback confirmation is a critical path item; lack of confirmed setback distances may delay design freeze.

### REQ-3505-012 — Migratory Bird Nesting Season Restriction & Wildlife Disturbance Mitigation

Vegetation clearing within the Waskasoo Creek corridor and all adjacent wetland/waterbody buffer zones shall comply with Alberta Wildlife Act and federal Migratory Birds Convention Act nesting season restrictions. The Design-Builder shall adhere to the following nesting season window and verification approach:

**Nesting Season Window:** Approximately April 1 to August 31 for central Alberta (confirm current dates with Alberta Wildlife Act regulations and Migratory Birds Convention Act provisions at the time of construction).

**Mandatory Requirement:** Vegetation clearing shall not be conducted during the nesting season (April 1 – August 31) unless a pre-clearing nest survey by a qualified biologist (Professional Biologist) has been completed within 5 days before clearing commences, and the survey confirms no active nests are present in the clearing area.

**Permitted Actions:**
1. **Outside Nesting Season (September 1 – March 31):** Vegetation clearing may be conducted without prior nest survey.
2. **During Nesting Season (April 1 – August 31):** Pre-clearing nest survey is required. If survey results confirm no active nests, clearing may proceed. If active nests are found during survey, no clearing shall occur within the setback distances specified in the biological survey report until nesting is complete and young have fledged.
3. If active nests are discovered during construction operations (after clearing has commenced), all work in the vicinity shall cease immediately until a qualified biologist confirms the nest is no longer active.

**Responsible Party:** Design-Builder Site Superintendent (for clearing scheduling and compliance confirmation); Design-Builder Environmental Consultant or contracted Professional Biologist (for nest surveys if required).
