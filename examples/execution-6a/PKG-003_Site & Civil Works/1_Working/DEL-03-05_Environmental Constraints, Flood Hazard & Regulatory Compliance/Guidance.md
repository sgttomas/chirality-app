# Guidance — DEL-03-05
## Environmental Constraints, Flood Hazard & Regulatory Compliance

---

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to ensure the PSB site development on the NW ¼ SEC. 6-37-27 W4M parcel is carried out within the legal and regulatory framework governing flood hazard, wetland impacts, and environmental protection in Alberta. Its outputs — the flood hazard constraints map, wetland/setback integration, environmental mitigation notes, and regulator coordination log — serve as the authoritative constraint reference for all PKG-003 civil design work.

The purpose is therefore both:
1. **Compliance:** To satisfy Alberta Water Act, Alberta Wetland Policy, and Town of Penhold MDP obligations before and during construction; and
2. **Design enablement:** To define the developable envelope clearly so that all other PKG-003 deliverables (site plan, grading, pavements, utilities) are designed within known constraints rather than discovered after the fact.

**Objective Support (ASSUMPTION: best-effort mapping per PACKAGE_HEURISTIC):**
- **OBJ-005:** This deliverable supports OBJ-005 by establishing the environmental and regulatory constraints that define the buildable site envelope. Without a confirmed flood hazard constraints map and resolved Water Act approval, the project cannot proceed to construction with regulatory certainty -- directly affecting the objective of delivering a functional facility within the project timeline. (ASSUMPTION: OBJ-005 relates to project delivery/schedule objectives; confirm exact OBJ-005 definition from decomposition.)
- **OBJ-008:** This deliverable supports OBJ-008 by ensuring that site development respects Alberta Wetland Policy, Water Act, and flood hazard requirements, thereby avoiding regulatory non-compliance, enforcement actions, or project delays due to environmental violations. (ASSUMPTION: OBJ-008 relates to regulatory compliance objectives; confirm exact OBJ-008 definition from decomposition.)

**Naming Convention Note:** Throughout this deliverable's documents, the Alberta provincial environmental regulator is referred to as "Alberta Environment and Protected Areas" (abbreviated **AEPA**). This ministry was formerly known as "Alberta Environment and Parks" (abbreviated "AEP"). Some source documents (particularly the 2021 Ghostpine reports and the Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit) use the former name. All references in these four documents have been standardized to AEPA. Where source documents are quoted directly, the original name is retained with a parenthetical note.

## Principles

### Principle 1 — Avoidance Before Mitigation
The Alberta Wetland Policy hierarchy is avoidance, then minimization, then replacement. The site layout should first seek to avoid wetland and waterbody features (DW01, DW02, DW03, DD01, DD02, and the anthropogenic ditch). Where avoidance is impracticable, minimization of impact area is required. The $10,769.54 in-lieu replacement fee (ABWRET-A; Wetland Assessment, Aug. 2021) applies only to the residual unavoidable impact — it does not pre-authorize unlimited impact.

### Principle 2 — Flood Fringe Is Not a Buildable Zone
The storm retention pond and dog park (~8 acres) occupy flood fringe that is explicitly identified as not suitable for building construction. The approximately 12-acre developable area is the binding constraint for all building placement and site works. The Design-Builder should not treat unused flood fringe land as an expansion reserve.

### Principle 3 — Regulatory Approvals Precede Ground Disturbance
Alberta Water Act approval from AEPA must be in hand before any ground-disturbing works impact wetlands or waterbodies. Construction sequencing must reflect this: the Water Act approval (and possibly any conditions thereof) must be resolved before mobilization in affected areas. The Wetland Assessment (Aug. 2021) was prepared in advance specifically to support this application.

### Principle 4 — Exact Flood Limits Must Be Confirmed, Not Assumed
The parcel flood zone exhibit and Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit provide indicative flood hazard mapping. These are planning-level tools; they are explicitly noted as "for reference only" and "may or may not be accurate, current, or otherwise reliable." The exact floodway/fringe limits must be confirmed with the Town of Penhold and/or AEPA during design before final building locations and earthworks are fixed.

### Principle 5 — Waskasoo Creek Is a Sensitive Receiving Water
All stormwater, erosion, and sediment control measures must be designed with Waskasoo Creek as the primary sensitive receiving water feature. The creek lies east of the site and receives drainage via the anthropogenic ditch on the southeast property boundary. Wildlife habitat along the creek corridor (including crow nesting observed in 2021) warrants awareness during construction activities near that boundary.

## Considerations

### Consideration 1 — Status of Water Act Application
The Wetland Assessment (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021) was prepared to support a Water Act application for the original "Public Works Yard" development footprint (~7.8 hectares + 0.42 ha access road). The current PSB project scope may differ from this footprint. The Design-Builder should confirm with the Town of Penhold whether:
- The Water Act application has been submitted to AEP
- Approval has been received (and any conditions issued)
- The approved footprint remains consistent with the current site plan

If the footprint has changed materially, an updated Water Act application may be required.

**Source:** Wetland Assessment Executive Summary and Introduction (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021); ASSUMPTION: the 2021 application was for a precursor project; current DB scope must be reconciled

### Consideration 2 — Wetland Feature Reconciliation with Current Site Plan
The wetland delineation fieldwork was conducted in May 2021. Three years have elapsed and the site conditions (particularly given agricultural cultivation activity) may have changed. The Design-Builder's environmental team should verify that the current wetland extents are still consistent with the 2021 delineations prior to finalizing setback integration.

**Source:** Wetland Assessment §2.2 (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021); ASSUMPTION: field conditions may have changed since 2021 survey; re-verification is prudent

### Consideration 3 — Waskasoo Creek and the Anthropogenic Ditch
The anthropogenic ditch (LC_20210520_045) along the southeast boundary of the project drains into Waskasoo Creek. Depending on construction activities near this ditch, separate approvals or notifications under the Alberta Water Act may be required for any works affecting it. The Design-Builder's environmental team should assess whether the ditch is classified as a watercourse under the Water Act.

**Source:** Desktop Environmental Assessment (Ghostpine, June 2021); ASSUMPTION: ditch classification under Water Act should be confirmed with AEP; this is a common regulatory ambiguity

### Consideration 4 — Wildlife Nesting Season Constraints
Three crow nests were observed along Waskasoo Creek during the May 2021 field survey. No raptor nests were confirmed. However, migratory bird nesting season (approximately April 1 to August 31 in Alberta) creates a timing constraint for vegetation clearing within proximity of the creek corridor. The Design-Builder should consider scheduling vegetation clearing outside nesting season where practicable, or obtain a qualified biologist to confirm nest activity prior to clearing.

**Source:** Desktop Environmental Assessment (Ghostpine, June 2021); ASSUMPTION: Alberta Wildlife Act nesting season provisions apply; location TBD

### Consideration 5 — Relationship with DEL-03-02 (Grading and Stormwater)
The environmental mitigation notes within this deliverable must be coherent with the stormwater management approach established in DEL-03-02. In particular, the Wetland Assessment references a Stormwater Management plan (Appendix F of the WAIR) as a component of mitigation. The Design-Builder should ensure the grading and stormwater design (DEL-03-02) is reviewed for compatibility with any AEPA-imposed conditions on stormwater management relative to wetland and creek protection.

**Timing Dependency Guidance:** The following sequencing should be observed between DEL-03-05 and DEL-03-02 (ASSUMPTION: sequencing is inferred from the nature of the deliverables; no formal dependency is declared in _DEPENDENCIES.md):
- **DEL-03-05 outputs that must precede DEL-03-02 grading design finalization:**
  1. Confirmed flood hazard constraints map (showing floodway/fringe limits and developable envelope) -- grading design cannot finalize grades and earthwork volumes in the flood fringe without knowing the authoritative flood limits.
  2. Wetland/setback integration output -- grading design must avoid encroaching on setback zones.
  3. Any AEPA conditions of Water Act approval that affect grading, stormwater, or fill placement -- must be available before DEL-03-02 design freeze.
- **DEL-03-02 outputs that inform DEL-03-05:**
  1. Stormwater management approach and discharge points -- needed to complete environmental mitigation notes (Section 5 of Step A6 in Procedure.md).
  2. Proposed earthwork cut/fill volumes and locations relative to flood fringe -- needed to assess fill placement compliance (REQ-3505-010).
- **Concurrent work is possible** for preliminary stages (e.g., DEL-03-05 can produce the initial flood hazard constraints map while DEL-03-02 begins preliminary grading layout), but design freeze for both deliverables should be coordinated to avoid rework.

**Scheduling Guidance:** Based on the nature of the two deliverables' outputs:
- **Critical Path Item:** Confirmation of flood hazard constraints (floodway/fringe limits and developable envelope) must be completed before DEL-03-02 grading design can finalize elevations and earthwork volumes. This is typically the longest-lead item (requires Town of Penhold coordination).
- **Concurrent Feasible:** Preliminary flood hazard mapping and initial wetland delineation can proceed in parallel with DEL-03-02 preliminary grading layout, but formal design freeze for both should be coordinated to avoid redesign.
- **Downstream Dependency:** DEL-03-02 stormwater discharge points and earthwork volumes are needed to finalize environmental mitigation notes (Step A6 Section 5 in Procedure) and to verify fill placement compliance (REQ-3505-010).

Recommend: Design-Builder PM should schedule a 2-week overlap during initial design to allow concurrent work on both deliverables, with formal coordination meeting(s) to align outputs before design freeze.

### Consideration 6 — Municipal Development Plan Alignment
The Town of Penhold MDP identifies a narrow floodway and flood fringe surrounding Waskasoo Creek. Alignment with the MDP is a prerequisite for development permit issuance by the Town. The Design-Builder should confirm with the Town which permits/approvals are required under the MDP and Land Use Bylaw specifically in relation to the flood fringe portions of the site.

**Source:** Desktop Environmental Assessment — Table 1 (Ghostpine, June 2021; citing Town of Penhold Municipal Development Plan); ASSUMPTION: Development Permit will be required from Town of Penhold; flood fringe provisions will be reviewed by Town at permit stage

## Trade-offs

### Trade-off 1 — Maximize Developable Area vs. Wetland Impact Minimization
**Tension:** Maximizing the usable yard area and building footprint within the ~12-acre developable envelope may push the design toward the wetland boundaries (DW01, DW02, DW03), increasing impact area and potentially increasing the in-lieu replacement fee or triggering additional AEP conditions.

**Resolution:** The Water Act application approach (in-lieu fee of $10,769.54 already calculated) indicates the intended mitigation strategy is replacement, not complete avoidance. However, the Alberta Wetland Policy requires that avoidance and minimization be genuinely pursued before replacement. The Design-Builder should document the layout alternatives considered to demonstrate the mitigation hierarchy was followed.

**Source:** Wetland Assessment §12.1–§12.4 (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021); Alberta Wetland Policy (location TBD)

### Trade-off 2 — Confirm Flood Limits Now vs. Proceed on Indicative Mapping
**Tension:** Confirming exact floodway/fringe limits requires regulatory engagement with the Town and/or AEP, which takes time. Proceeding on the indicative parcel flood zone exhibit allows design to advance faster but creates risk of redesign if confirmed limits differ from what was assumed.

**Resolution:** Given the explicit open issue noted in both the decomposition (SOW-0114) and _CONTEXT.md, flood limit confirmation should be treated as a critical path item to be resolved early in design. Proceeding with building location assumptions that encroach on the flood fringe without confirmed limits is a material regulatory risk.

### Trade-off 3 — Use 2021 Wetland Assessment vs. Commission Updated Survey
**Tension:** The 2021 Wetland Assessment was prepared for the original Public Works Yard footprint and was field-completed in May 2021. Using it as-is is efficient; commissioning an update delays the Water Act application process.

**Resolution:** If the project footprint is materially consistent with the 2021 survey area, and AEP does not require an updated delineation (given the 3+ year gap), the 2021 report may be sufficient. The Design-Builder should seek early guidance from AEP on the acceptability of the 2021 report before assuming it is current.

## Examples

The Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit (Penhold/PCPS, Dec. 2022) provides a directly applicable example of how flood hazard zones are shown on a planning map alongside the Future Public Works Yard footprint. The legend distinguishes:
- Floodway (hatched, darker)
- West Edge of Flood Hazard (dotted line)
- Environmental Reserve (ER) as a land use designation

This exhibit serves as the starting point for the flood hazard constraints map and illustrates the expected level of graphic representation.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-3505-01 | The Wetland Assessment (Aug. 2021) was prepared for a ~7.8 ha Public Works Yard footprint. The current PSB scope includes a combined Public Works + Fire Hall building on approximately 12 acres. It is unclear whether the 2021 Water Act application footprint encompasses the current project scope or is materially different. | Wetland Assessment Introduction §1 (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021): "approximately 7.8 hectare, Public Works Yard and 0.42 hectare access road" | Addendum 03 §1.1: "remaining 12-acre site"; Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit: Future Public Works Yard = 7.92 ha | REQ-3505-005, REQ-3505-006, Consideration 1 | Design-Builder to verify with Town of Penhold and AEP whether existing application is current and covers current footprint; if not, an updated application is required | TBD |
| CONF-3505-02 | The parcel flood zone exhibit explicitly states it is "for reference only" and "may or may not be accurate, current, or otherwise reliable." However, SOW-0114 requires the Design-Builder to respect flood hazard constraints "shown on Town planning exhibits." The applicable authority for definitive flood limit mapping is unclear — it may be the parcel exhibit, the Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit, or a separate regulatory document from AEP or the Town. | Parcel Flood Zone exhibit legend note: "for reference only... THIS MAP IS NOT TO BE USED FOR NAVIGATION" | Decomposition SOW-0114: "respects flood hazard constraints shown on Town planning exhibits" | REQ-3505-001, REQ-3505-004, Trade-off 2 | Confirm with Town of Penhold which exhibit(s) and which flood mapping dataset(s) are authoritative for permit/approval purposes | TBD |
