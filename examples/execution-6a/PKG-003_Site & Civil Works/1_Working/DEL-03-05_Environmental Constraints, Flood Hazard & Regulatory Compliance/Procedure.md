# Procedure — DEL-03-05
## Environmental Constraints, Flood Hazard & Regulatory Compliance

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes two complementary workflows:

1. **Production Procedure** — Steps to produce the four deliverable artifacts (flood hazard constraints map, wetland/setback integration, environmental mitigation notes, regulator coordination log) during the proposal and early design phases.
2. **Implementation Procedure** — Steps to carry out environmental and flood hazard compliance obligations through design, construction, and closeout phases.

Both workflows are presented because this deliverable defines ongoing operational constraints, not just a static document output.

## Steps

### Part A — Production of Deliverable Artifacts (Proposal Through Design Phases)

**Step A1 — Assemble Existing Constraint Data**
1. Obtain and review the parcel flood zone exhibit (Town of Penhold) and Adjacent Subdivision Design exhibit (Penhold/PCPS, Dec. 2022) to extract:
   - 100-Year Floodway and 100-Year Flood Fringe extents as georeferenced or scaled polygons
   - The ~12-acre developable envelope boundary
   - ER and storm pond areas
2. Note that these exhibits are reference-only; flag the need to confirm authoritative flood mapping with the Town (REQ-3505-004).
3. Obtain the Wetland Assessment (Ghostpine, Aug. 2021) wetland delineation boundaries from Appendix A figures (GIS/PDF) for DW01, DW02, DW03, DD01, DD02, and the anthropogenic ditch.
4. Record all sources, dates, and access limitations in the regulator coordination log.

**Step A2 — Confirm Water Act Application Status**
1. Contact the Town of Penhold to confirm:
   - Whether the Water Act application based on the 2021 Wetland Assessment has been submitted to AEPA
   - Current status: submitted / pending / approved / conditions issued
   - Whether the current PSB project footprint is covered by the 2021 application
2. If the application has not been submitted, or if the footprint has materially changed, engage an environmental consultant (ASSUMPTION: environmental consultant required; Ghostpine is the originating firm) to either reactivate or update the application.
3. Record all interactions in the regulator coordination log with dates and contact details.

**Step A3 — Confirm Flood Hazard Limits with Town of Penhold**
1. Contact the Town of Penhold Planning/Engineering department to identify:
   - The authoritative flood hazard mapping dataset used for development permit review
   - Whether the parcel flood zone exhibit represents the current adopted mapping
   - Any conditions or development permit requirements specific to flood fringe development on this parcel
2. Obtain written confirmation or official mapping if available.
3. Record all interactions in the regulator coordination log.

**Step A3.5 — Initiate Town of Penhold Development Permit Application**
1. Confirm with the Town of Penhold whether a Development Permit is required for this project in relation to flood hazard compliance. (Development Permits are typically required for projects within flood fringe zones or that may affect flood continuity; see Guidance Consideration 6.)
2. Prepare and submit a Development Permit application package that includes:
   - Site plan showing proposed buildings, site works, and flood/wetland constraint overlays
   - Flood hazard constraints map (preliminary version from Step A4, if available)
   - Environmental mitigation notes (draft from Step A6, if available)
   - Any other materials required by Town submission requirements
3. Record the submission date, file number, and contact details in the regulator coordination log.
4. Coordinate with the Owner to confirm the timing of the Development Permit application relative to the Water Act application (Step A2) and flood limit confirmation (Step A3). Both may need to proceed in parallel.

**Note:** Development Permit approval from the Town of Penhold is a prerequisite for construction commencement in flood fringe areas (Guidance Consideration 6, Procedure Step B1). This step should be initiated as soon as preliminary flood/wetland constraint mapping is available to avoid delays in the critical path. Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md A-004.

**Step A4 — Produce Flood Hazard Constraints Map**
1. Using confirmed (or best-available) flood zone data, produce a site plan overlay showing:
   - 100-Year Floodway extent and 100-Year Flood Fringe extent
   - Site parcel boundary (NW ¼ SEC. 6-37-27 W4M)
   - Developable envelope (~12 acres) and excluded flood fringe areas (~8 acres: storm pond + dog park)
   - Proposed building location(s), access routes, and major site works relative to flood zones
   - Waskasoo Creek channel location (east boundary)
2. Annotate the map with:
   - Confirmation status of flood limits (confirmed / indicative / pending)
   - Any no-build zones within floodway
   - Fill constraint notation (where applicable)
3. Mark any areas where design assumptions are pending regulatory confirmation as "PENDING CONFIRMATION."

**Step A5 — Produce Wetland/Setback Integration**
1. Using the Wetland Assessment Appendix A figure (field-delineated boundaries) as the base:
   - Plot DW01 (seasonal marsh), DW02 (temporary marsh), DW03 (ephemeral waterbody), DD01, DD02 (ephemeral drainages), and anthropogenic ditch on the site plan
   - Apply any required setbacks per AEPA Water Act approval conditions (TBD — conditional on approval)
   - Identify areas of proposed works that overlap or approach wetland/waterbody boundaries
2. If any AEPA approval conditions have been issued, incorporate the conditions as constraints on the overlay.
3. Note any features that may require updated field verification (given 2021 delineation; see Consideration 2 in Guidance.md).

**Step A6 — Prepare Environmental Mitigation Notes**
Draft environmental mitigation notes addressing the following sections (minimum):

- **Section 1 — Wetland Avoidance and Minimization:** Identify how the proposed layout minimizes overlap with DW01, DW02, DW03, and drainage features; document layout alternatives considered (for AEPA/Alberta Wetland Policy hierarchy compliance).
- **Section 2 — Water Act Replacement Obligation:** State the in-lieu fee ($10,769.54; confirm current value with AEPA) and payment obligation upon approval.
- **Section 3 — Wildlife Disturbance Mitigation:**
  - Vegetation clearing near Waskasoo Creek corridor to avoid active nesting season (approximately April 1 – August 31; confirm with current Alberta Wildlife Act requirements; location TBD)
  - Pre-construction nest surveys if clearing is planned during nesting season
  - No disturbance of confirmed active nests
- **Section 4 — Erosion and Sediment Control:**
  - Install silt fencing, sediment traps, or equivalent measures downslope of disturbed areas before ground disturbance
  - Protect anthropogenic ditch and Waskasoo Creek from sediment and construction runoff
- **Section 5 — Stormwater Management Interface:** Cross-reference with DEL-03-02 for stormwater management measures; ensure they do not concentrate flows toward wetland remnants or the Waskasoo Creek corridor

**Step A7 — Initialize and Maintain Regulator Coordination Log**
1. Create a tabular log with the following columns (minimum):
   - Entry date
   - Regulator / contact
   - Subject / topic
   - Method of communication
   - Key information received or communicated
   - Action items and responsible party
   - Status (open / closed)
2. Populate all entries retroactively from Step A2 and A3.
3. Update continuously throughout design and construction.

### Part B — Implementation During Design, Construction, and Closeout

**Step B1 — Pre-Construction Regulatory Clearance (Formal Gate Review)**
1. Conduct a formal pre-construction regulatory clearance review before any ground-disturbing work in or adjacent to wetland, waterbody, or flood fringe areas. This is a critical path gate and must be satisfied before site mobilization.
2. Confirm the following documents are in project file and in force:
   - Water Act approval letter from Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (AEPA), including any conditions of approval and their implementation timeline
   - Town of Penhold Development Permit (and any related flood fringe approval or conditional approval letter)
   - Fill placement acceptance letter(s) or written confirmation from Town of Penhold and AEPA (where applicable, per REQ-3505-010)
3. Confirm that the Site Superintendent has received a briefing on:
   - All environmental conditions of approval (from both AEPA and Town)
   - No-go zones (floodway boundaries, wetland setback zones, sensitive waterbody buffers)
   - Erosion and sediment control requirements and inspection frequency
   - Vegetation clearing restrictions and nesting season windows
   - Points of contact for environmental issues during construction
4. Document the clearance gate review in the regulator coordination log, including sign-off by the Design-Builder PM and the Site Superintendent.
5. Retain all regulatory approval documents and clearance documentation in the project file.

**Step B2 — Construction Phase Monitoring**
1. **Installation of Erosion and Sediment Control Measures (Timing Prerequisite):** Before any ground disturbance commences in environmentally sensitive areas (wetland buffers, near waterbodies, within flood fringe), verify that erosion and sediment control measures have been installed and are in place. These measures must include:
   - Silt fencing installed downslope of disturbed areas
   - Sediment traps or filter dikes in stormwater discharge paths
   - Inlet protection devices on storm drains
   - Any other measures specified in environmental mitigation notes or AEPA conditions
   Verify installation by Site Superintendent or Environmental Monitor before issuing work authorization for ground disturbance. (Source: _SEMANTIC_LENSING.md C-002 -- missing operational readiness threshold for erosion/sediment control installation timing.)
2. Inspect silt fencing and erosion/sediment control measures at the start of each work phase and after significant rainfall events (within 24 hours of rainfall).
3. Confirm vegetation clearing is conducted outside nesting season (approximately April 1 – August 31), or confirm that a qualified biologist has completed a pre-clearing nest survey with documented results showing no active nests in the clearing area.
4. Monitor any areas of residual wetland or drainage feature for evidence of unauthorized impact; document in field reports and notify Environmental Monitor immediately if impacts are observed.
5. Update regulator coordination log with any agency site visits, inspections, or notices; record any non-compliance observations and corrective actions taken.

**Step B3 — Wetland Replacement Fee Payment**
1. Upon receipt of Water Act approval, arrange payment of the ABWRET-A in-lieu replacement fee (amount confirmed with AEPA at time of approval — $10,769.54 as of 2021 assessment).
2. Retain payment receipt in project file and record in regulator coordination log.

**Step B4 — Post-Construction Condition Compliance & AEPA Condition Closeout**
1. If AEPA issued conditions of approval as part of the Water Act approval (e.g., monitoring of residual wetland features, revegetation requirements, sediment control inspection records, erosion control removal timeline), implement and document all required compliance activities with photos and dated records.
2. Compile evidence of condition compliance (monitoring reports, revegetation completion documentation, remediation records, etc.) and submit to AEPA with a formal closeout request.
3. Obtain written confirmation from AEPA that all Water Act approval conditions are satisfied and the approval file is closed out. Record the closeout date and reference number in the regulator coordination log.
4. If AEPA identifies any outstanding conditions or non-compliance, record the issues in the regulator coordination log with expected closure timeline and responsible party.

**Step B5 — Closeout Documentation & As-Built Map Update**
1. Consolidate the regulator coordination log as a project closeout record, including all regulatory interactions, approvals, conditions, and their closure status.
2. Confirm that the flood hazard constraints map has been updated to reflect as-built site conditions. Specifically:
   - Update floodway and flood fringe boundaries to reflect the confirmed (final) limits as they were executed/built on site
   - Update the map to show the final location of buildings, site works, and utilities as-built
   - Update setback zone boundaries based on the actual layout of wetland/waterbody features as constructed
   - Note any discrepancies between the preliminary flood hazard constraints map (REQ-3505-003) and the as-built conditions
3. Retain all regulatory approval documents (Water Act approval, Development Permit, fee receipts, condition closeout confirmation) in the project O&M/closeout package.
4. Update the Records table entries (Records section below) to note final location and version of all deliverable artifacts.
