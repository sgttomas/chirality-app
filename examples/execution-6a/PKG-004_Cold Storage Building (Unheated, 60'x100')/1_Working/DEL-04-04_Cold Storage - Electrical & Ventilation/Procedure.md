## Steps

### Phase A: Narrative Production (Proposal Phase)

**Step 1 — Establish Building and Equipment Parameters**
- Confirm building dimensions (60'×100'), ceiling/ridge height, and structural bay spacing from DEL-04-01 or architectural concept.
- Confirm maximum equipment height (tallest vehicle/equipment to be stored) from OSR §10.3.5 and operational input.
- Confirm number of person doors (2) and overhead door locations and sizes (2 × 16'×16') from DEL-04-02 or OSR §10.3.9.
- Obtain and record key climate data for Penhold, AB (design temperatures, heating degree days, humidity ranges) from Environment Canada climate normals **[B-003]**.
- Record parameters as inputs to lighting and ventilation sizing.

**Step 2 — Select and Justify Ventilation Approach**
- Evaluate ventilation options for an unheated 60'×100' cold-climate storage building:
  - Option A: Passive ventilation (ridge vents, gable louvres, soffit vents)
  - Option B: Active ventilation (circulation fans, exhaust fans)
  - Option C: Hybrid (passive openings supplemented by circulation fans)
- Select the approach based on moisture management effectiveness, maintenance burden, and cost.
- Include a detailed lifecycle cost comparison of ventilation approach options **[A-005, F-004]**, addressing:
  - Capital cost of equipment, wiring, and controls
  - Annual energy consumption (kWh/year) if active components selected
  - Maintenance cost over 20-year design life
  - Risk-adjusted cost of condensation/icing damage if passive-only proves insufficient
  - Operational staffing burden (thermostat/humidity control requirements)
- Consider secondary effects of ventilation on stored equipment **[C-004]**:
  - Corrosion risk from high-velocity air over wet metal surfaces
  - Moisture exposure to parked equipment under passive-only approach
  - Balance between adequate drying and equipment protection
- Document the selected approach with a brief rationale addressing condensation and icing prevention (OSR §11.1.2).
- Note: If Option A or C includes passive openings, coordinate opening locations with building envelope design (DEL-04-01).

**Step 3 — Develop Condensation and Icing Mitigation Notes**
- Identify the primary condensation risk mechanisms:
  - Temperature differential at doors (warm exterior air entering cold interior, or vice versa)
  - Vehicle/equipment moisture ingress (snow and rain on incoming equipment)
  - Humidity from stored materials and equipment off-gassing
  - Floor icing from condensation freezing on concrete surfaces (primary safety hazard)
- Describe how the selected ventilation approach mitigates each mechanism.
- Include any supplemental measures (e.g., drainage channels at door thresholds, vapour detailing at penetrations, floor slope to drain, drain plugs or gutters at door thresholds).
- Cross-reference to OSR §11.2 (positive drainage of condensation within wall construction).
- Reference applicable engineering standards or published guidance for condensation analysis in unheated storage buildings (ASHRAE guidelines for cold-climate storage, NBCC Section 9 moisture control, or equivalent) — if no authoritative reference is available, note this gap and document the assumptions underlying the ventilation sizing **[B-004]**.
- Explicitly address condensation risk on electrical components and corrosion prevention measures.

**Step 4 — Develop Basic Lighting/Power Basis**
- Estimate electrical service size **[A-004]**:
  - Connected loads: lighting, interior and exterior receptacles, two motorized door openers, ventilation fans if active, block heater circuits if required **[E-002]**, margin for future flexibility (OSR §10.4).
  - Document load calculation assumptions (fixture wattages, receptacle demand factors, door opener specifications).
  - Preliminary service size (amps) shall be confirmed in detailed design once load calc is complete.
- Develop a conceptual circuit layout:
  - Lighting circuits (interior, emergency exit lights)
  - Receptacle circuits (interior general-purpose, exterior weatherproof, block heater if required)
  - Door opener circuits (dedicated per opener, safety reversing sensor, remote receiver)
  - Panel location accessible and protected from weather/moisture.
- Confirm whether block heater receptacles are required for stored equipment in the unheated building **[E-002]**; if yes, include in receptacle requirements, load calculation, and circuit layout. Coordinate with Owner operations team.
- Select LED fixture type appropriate for cold storage environment and equipment clearance height; confirm compliance with IES recommendations (OSR §10.5).
- Establish target foot-candle value per applicable IES storage occupancy category **[A-003]**; confirm specific value with IES category definition.
- Provide minimum receptacle quantity or spacing guidance for interior receptacles to support design development **[C-003]** (e.g., "one receptacle per 30 linear feet of wall, or TBD per operational needs assessment").
- Confirm emergency exit light locations (above each person door, cold-rated battery backup units rated for unheated building winter temperatures).
- Confirm weatherproof switch locations at each person door.
- Address maintenance access approach for high-mounted lighting fixtures and ventilation equipment **[E-003]**:
  - Coordinate with structural design (DEL-04-01) on fixed access points (roof catwalks, ladders)
  - Specify LED lifespans sufficient to minimize maintenance frequency over 20-year service life
  - Document maintenance procedure assumptions (frequency, staffing, equipment needed)
- Document as a "basic lighting/power basis" narrative — not a full electrical design, but sufficient to demonstrate feasibility, code awareness, and operational readiness.

**Step 5 — Compile and Review Proposal Documents**
- Assemble the three anticipated artifacts:
  1. Ventilation/air circulation approach (from Step 2)
  2. Condensation/icing mitigation notes (from Step 3)
  3. Basic lighting/power basis (from Step 4)
- Review for consistency with other PKG-004 deliverables (DEL-04-01, DEL-04-02, DEL-04-03).
- Ensure all requirements from OSR §10.4, §10.5, and §11.1.2 are addressed.
- MEP lead to review and approve before submission.

- Develop condensation risk analysis demonstrating proposed ventilation approach is sufficient for Penhold climate conditions **[X-001]**.
- Coordinate electrical conduit routing with floor/foundation system (DEL-04-03) — confirm slab penetrations or surface-mounted conduit approach.
- Coordinate overhead door opener electrical connections with door supplier (DEL-04-02).
- Confirm Alberta Fire Code compliance for emergency exit lighting placement and quantity **[D-001]**.
- Submit for AHJ review and electrical permit.

**Step 7 — Procurement and Submittal Review**
- Select and procure LED fixtures, emergency exit lights (cold-rated), weatherproof switches and covers, ventilation equipment (fans or louvre assemblies), and electrical components.
- Submit product data sheets for Owner/Design-Builder review.
- Confirm cold-temperature ratings for battery-backup emergency lighting units.
