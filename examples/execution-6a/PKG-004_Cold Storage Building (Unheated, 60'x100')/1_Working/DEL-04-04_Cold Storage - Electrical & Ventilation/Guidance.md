# Guidance: DEL-04-04 — Cold Storage Electrical & Ventilation

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to establish the electrical and ventilation design basis for the 60'×100' unheated cold storage building within the Penhold Public Services Building project. Its primary function is to demonstrate that the Design-Builder has a credible, practical approach to:

1. Preventing moisture damage (condensation and icing) through adequate ventilation or air circulation — the central performance challenge for an unheated building in the Penhold, Alberta climate.
2. Providing safe, functional, code-compliant electrical power and lighting for large-equipment storage operations.

The deliverable supports **OBJ-004**: deliver the unheated cold storage building with practical access, moisture management, and door configuration compatible with the main building. (Source: Decomposition, OBJ-004 definition)

The anticipated artifacts — a ventilation/air circulation approach narrative, condensation/icing mitigation notes, and a basic lighting/power basis — are proposal-phase documents that will inform detailed design in the post-award phase.

## Principles

### P-1: Moisture management is the primary design driver
The building is unheated. In the Penhold, Alberta climate (cold winters, significant temperature cycling), condensation forms on cold metal surfaces when warm, moist air enters the building — particularly when equipment is brought in or out. Ice formation on floors and structure is a serious safety hazard. The ventilation strategy must address this directly.
**Source:** OSR §11.1.2 (RFP PDF p.43); SOW-0300 (Decomposition)

### P-2: Design-Builder has flexibility in the ventilation approach
The OSR explicitly permits "adequate ventilation or alternate air circulation" — it does not mandate a specific system type. This means the DB may propose passive ventilation (ridge vents, gable vents, louvred openings), active ventilation (circulation fans, exhaust fans), or a hybrid approach, provided the proposed method credibly prevents condensation and icing.
**Source:** OSR §11.1.2 (RFP PDF p.43)

### P-3: Electrical design must support current operations and future flexibility
The electrical system should accommodate the operational load of heavy equipment storage and maintenance activities today, while not foreclosing future additions (additional receptacles, charging stations, future equipment). The OSR explicitly calls for future flexibility.
**Source:** OSR §10.4 (RFP PDF p.42)

### P-4: Lighting must be safe and practical for heavy equipment operations
The cold storage building stores the same equipment types as the main building: pickup trucks, tractors, graders, loaders, and other construction-type equipment (OSR §10.3.5). Fixture mounting heights must clear this equipment. LED fixtures provide long service life and reduced maintenance burden — appropriate for a 20-year design life ancillary building.
**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP PDF p.42); OSR §10.3.5 (RFP PDF p.40)

### P-5: Materials must be durable and watertight in a cold, unheated environment
Electrical enclosures, conduits, and ventilation components must withstand an unheated cold-climate environment — including freeze-thaw cycling, condensation on interior surfaces, and potential moisture ingress at penetrations. The OSR requires watertight, non-combustible construction. Specific quality benchmarks for material selection — such as NEMA enclosure rating and corrosion resistance class appropriate for unheated cold-climate environments — should be established by the DB MEP engineer with reference to CEC requirements. TBD — confirm applicable NEMA rating and corrosion resistance standards. (Source: OSR §11.3; **[D-003]**)

## Considerations

### C-1: Condensation formation mechanisms in unheated storage buildings
When vehicles or equipment enter from the cold exterior into a slightly warmer interior (or vice versa), temperature differentials across metal cladding and structure create condensation. Floor icing is the most dangerous consequence — ice forming on a concrete or asphalt floor creates a slip/fall hazard for workers and traction risk for equipment. The ventilation strategy should specifically address floor-level moisture.

This understanding is currently based on general engineering knowledge and should be strengthened with reference to published engineering guidance for unheated storage buildings (e.g., ASHRAE guidelines for cold-climate storage facilities or equivalent). TBD — confirm applicable authoritative engineering references for condensation analysis in unheated storage buildings. (Source: **[B-004]** ASHRAE or cold-climate building design references — location TBD)

**Source:** OSR §11.1.2 (RFP PDF p.43); general engineering knowledge (ASSUMPTION — no detailed moisture analysis in available sources).

### C-2: Passive vs. active ventilation trade-off
Passive ventilation (ridge/gable vents) has no operating cost and no mechanical components to maintain, but its effectiveness depends on wind and stack effect — which may be insufficient during calm, cold weather periods when moisture risk is highest. Active ventilation (circulation fans or exhaust fans) provides controllable, year-round moisture management but adds mechanical components, electrical load, and maintenance requirements. A hybrid approach (passive openings with supplemental circulation fans) may offer the best balance for this building type.

**Cost-benefit framing [A-005]:** The selection among passive, active, and hybrid approaches has lifecycle cost implications that should be quantified. A brief cost-benefit or lifecycle-cost comparison shall be developed by DB estimating / MEP engineer to inform the ventilation approach selection during detailed design. Key factors include:
  - Capital cost of fan equipment, wiring, and controls
  - Annual energy consumption of active components (kWh/year × electricity rate)
  - Maintenance cost over the 20-year design life (bearing replacement, motor service, etc.)
  - Risk-adjusted cost of condensation/icing damage if passive-only proves insufficient
  - Operational burden on staff to manage thermostats or humidity controls if active approach selected

The lifecycle cost analysis shall be documented in the ventilation design narrative (anticipated artifact) and presented to the Owner for validation before final design. (Source: Guidance C-2; **[A-005]**, **[F-004]**)

**Source:** OSR §11.1.2 (general design practice context; ASSUMPTION — specific approach not mandated by OSR).

### C-3: Overhead door electrical coordination
Two 16'×16' motorized overhead door openers require dedicated electrical circuits, safety reversing sensors, and remote control receivers. The electrical design must coordinate with DEL-04-02 (Doors, Openings & Hardware) to confirm opener model, electrical demand, and control requirements.
**Source:** OSR §10.4; OSR §10.3.9 (RFP PDF p.42, p.41); SOW-0302 (Decomposition)

### C-4: Emergency exit lighting placement
With two person doors (one per side), emergency exit lights are required above each. The unheated environment requires that the battery-backup units selected are rated for cold-temperature operation. Standard emergency lighting units are often rated to 0°C at the battery; an unheated Alberta storage building will routinely fall below this threshold.
**Source:** OSR §10.5 (RFP PDF p.42); ASSUMPTION — cold-temperature battery rating constraint is a standard engineering consideration not explicitly addressed in OSR.

### C-5: Fixture height and equipment clearance
The building is intended to house equipment of the same types as the main Public Works shop: tractors, graders, tandem dump units, loaders, bobcats. Fixture mounting heights must provide clearance for these vehicles. Typical clearance for a loader or grader may require fixtures mounted near the ridge or on high sidewalls rather than at mid-height. The DB should confirm maximum equipment height when establishing fixture mounting height, taking into account the height of any attachments (snow plows, buckets, boom extensions) that may extend the effective height of parked equipment.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.5 (RFP PDF p.40); OSR §10.5 (RFP PDF p.42)

### C-6: Design life alignment — 20-year ancillary building
The cold storage building has a 20-year design life (OSR §10.2 General; "20 year life expectancy for the sand/salt and cold storage"). Electrical and ventilation components should be selected with this service life in mind — LED fixtures with appropriately rated lifespans (typically 50,000–100,000 hours), fan motors with adequate MTBF (mean time between failure), and enclosures with corrosion protection appropriate for the cold, unheated climate. A 20-year service life in an unheated Alberta building means outdoor-equivalent thermal and humidity stress on indoor electrical components; material durability and corrosion resistance shall be specified accordingly (see **[D-003]** material quality benchmarks).
**Source:** OSR §10.2 General (RFP PDF p.36); **[D-003]**

### C-7: Coordination with building envelope and drainage
Ventilation openings (if passive or hybrid approach is used) require coordination with the building envelope design (DEL-04-01). Opening locations, flashing, and insect/bird screening details must be resolved with the architectural/structural team. The OSR also requires positive drainage of condensation within wall construction directed to the exterior (OSR §11.2).
**Source:** OSR §11.2 (RFP PDF p.44)

### C-8: Ventilation impact on stored equipment [C-004]
The selected ventilation approach may have secondary effects on stored equipment and materials. For example, high airflow rates over metal equipment surfaces that have residual moisture (snow, rain) could accelerate corrosion in certain conditions; conversely, inadequate ventilation allows condensation to persist on equipment surfaces. The DB should consider whether the ventilation strategy appropriately balances moisture removal with minimizing adverse effects on stored assets (e.g., corrosion risk from extended moisture exposure or from high-velocity air over wet metal surfaces).
TBD — DB MEP / operations to assess ventilation impact on stored equipment.
**Source:** General engineering consideration (ASSUMPTION — not addressed in OSR); **[C-004]**

### C-9: Energy consumption of active ventilation [F-004]
If active ventilation components (fans) are selected, the annual energy consumption and associated operating costs over the 20-year design life should be considered. While individual fan energy consumption may be modest, the cumulative operating cost is a relevant factor in the lifecycle merit assessment of the ventilation approach (see also C-2 cost-benefit framing and C-6 design life alignment).
TBD — DB MEP engineer / estimating to quantify expected annual energy consumption for active ventilation options.
**Source:** General engineering consideration (ASSUMPTION — operating energy cost not addressed in OSR); **[F-004]**

### C-10: Maintenance access for high-mounted equipment [E-003]
Lighting fixtures and ventilation equipment (fans, louvres) may be mounted at significant heights to clear stored heavy equipment. The maintainability of these components should be considered in the design — including safe access methods for lamp replacement (e.g., LED fixtures rated for 50k–100k hour lifespans to minimize replacement frequency), fan motor servicing, and louvre cleaning. The building will house heavy equipment, which limits the use of standard lifts or scaffolding in some configurations. Access strategy options include:
  - Fixture placement at accessible height on walls rather than only at ridge height
  - Use of extra-long-life LED units to reduce maintenance frequency over 20-year design life
  - Specification of fan equipment with modular/cartridge-style motors that allow field replacement without complete unit removal
  - Provision of fixed roof access (catwalk or ladder) for high-mounted equipment inspection and service

The DB should address maintenance access strategy as part of the fixture and ventilation equipment placement design, coordinating with building structural design (DEL-04-01) and the facility operations team.
TBD — DB MEP / operations to confirm preferred maintenance access approach and maintenance resource availability.
**Source:** General engineering consideration (ASSUMPTION — maintenance access not explicitly addressed in OSR); OSR §10.5 (fixture height requirement implies access challenge); **[E-003]**

## Trade-offs

| Tension | Resolution | Rationale | Source |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Passive ventilation (low cost, no moving parts) vs. Active ventilation (reliable moisture control) | ASSUMPTION: Hybrid approach is likely optimal — passive openings sized for normal conditions, supplemental circulation fan(s) for high-humidity events | Penhold winters include prolonged still-air periods when passive ventilation may be inadequate; active supplement provides controllable moisture management at modest additional cost | OSR §11.1.2; general engineering practice |
| Cold-rated vs. standard emergency battery units | Cold-rated units required | An unheated Alberta building will fall below standard battery ratings in winter; specifying cold-rated units ensures code compliance and reliable operation | OSR §10.5; ASSUMPTION re: temperature thresholds |
| Future electrical flexibility vs. minimal initial cost | Provide conduit/stub-outs for future circuits at panel | OSR explicitly requires future flexibility; provision during construction is far less costly than future retrofit | OSR §10.4 |
| LED fixture height (high for equipment clearance) vs. adequate foot-candle levels at floor | Increase fixture quantity or wattage to compensate for height | IES compliance must be maintained regardless of mounting height; LED technology allows this trade-off to be resolved with appropriate fixture selection | OSR §10.5 |

## Examples

TBD — No specific ventilation or electrical design examples for unheated storage buildings were identified in the accessible source materials. The Design-Builder should draw on comparable cold-climate storage building precedents during the detailed design phase.

## Terminology Normalization Note [X-002]

**Issue:** Terminology consistency for ventilation scope across the four documents:
- Datasheet uses: "Ventilation requirement" / "Ventilation approach"
- Specification uses: "Ventilation — Condensation and Icing Prevention" / "Ventilation — Method and Sizing"
- Guidance uses: "ventilation strategy"
- Procedure uses: "Ventilation/air circulation approach"

**Action for next phase:** Standardize on a consistent terminology:
- **Recommended primary term:** "Ventilation system" or "Ventilation approach" (covers both passive and active options)
- **Recommended secondary terms:** "Condensation mitigation" / "Icing prevention" (the functional objectives), "Ventilation method" (passive vs. active choice), "Ventilation sizing" (the technical design step)

This will be harmonized in detailed design documentation (Stage 2) to ensure AHJ communications and contractor submittals use consistent language. For proposal purposes, the slight terminological variation is acceptable as long as the functional intent remains clear.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No unresolvable conflicts identified at time of drafting. The following items are flagged for human awareness:

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | PROPOSAL | Human Ruling |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| C-DEL04-04-01 | OSR §10.3.8 Flooring section describes two floor options for cold storage (Option 1: compacted asphalt millings + concrete strips; Option 2: full concrete floor), but the decomposition assigns floor/foundation scope to DEL-04-03, not DEL-04-04. Concrete floor aprons at overhead doors may generate electrical coordination implications (e.g., in-floor heating — though OSR does not specify this). | OSR §10.3.8 (RFP PDF p.41) | Decomposition DEL-04-03 scope boundary | Specification R-01 to R-05; Procedure Step 3 | Floor system selection (DEL-04-03) should be confirmed before finalizing electrical layout to avoid rework | TBD |
| C-DEL04-04-02 | Exterior lighting for cold storage building is neither explicitly required nor excluded in OSR; creates ambiguity about whether exterior fixtures are needed. Interior lighting is clearly required (OSR §10.5), and exterior receptacles are required (OSR §10.4), but exterior lighting is silent. **[B-002, B-005]** | OSR §10.5 (interior lighting requirements) | OSR §10.4 (exterior receptacles required, lighting silent) | Specification Scope; Datasheet Lighting Attributes | OSR review / DB design team to confirm exterior lighting requirement or exclusion | TBD |
