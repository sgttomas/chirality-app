# Specification: DEL-04-04 — Cold Storage Electrical & Ventilation

## Scope

### In Scope
This specification governs the electrical and ventilation design for the Cold Storage Building (60'×100', unheated) within the Penhold Public Services Building project. It covers:

- Electrical power distribution and receptacle layout (interior and exterior)
- Overhead door opener electrical supply
- Interior lighting design (LED, IES-compliant)
- Emergency exit lighting
- Ventilation and air circulation system to prevent condensation and icing
- Weatherproofing of electrical devices at person door locations
- Grounding system

### Out of Scope
- IT/data and telecommunications infrastructure (applies to main building only; OSR §10.6)
- PA system (applies to main building only; OSR §10.6)
- Heating systems (building is intentionally unheated; OSR §10.2)
- Sand-salt storage building electrical/ventilation (separate scope)
- Main building electrical and mechanical systems (covered under PKG-002 deliverables)
- Access control and security camera systems (optional items under PKG-005)

### Scope Clarifications
- **Exterior lighting:** TBD — Confirm whether exterior building-mounted lighting is required for the cold storage building, or explicitly exclude from scope. OSR §10.5 addresses lighting generally but does not differentiate interior vs. exterior for cold storage. (Source: OSR §10.5; **[B-005]**)
