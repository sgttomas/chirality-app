| Hardware grade | Standard grade (ASSUMPTION; consistent with overhead door hardware grade; lifecycle adequacy for 20-year design life TBD [Lensing items A-005, F-004]) | ASSUMPTION; OSR §10.3.9 (p.41-42) |

### Concrete Aprons

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Location | At all overhead door access points (2 locations) | OSR §10.3.10 (p.42) |
| Design loading | To support weight and operation of service vehicles (graders, tandem dump trucks, loaders, bobcats) | OSR §10.3.10 (p.42); OSR §10.3.5 (p.40) |
| Dimensions | TBD (DB to design; minimum width/depth sufficient for safe vehicle approach and door operation; minimum thickness per structural/civil design for service vehicle loading) | ASSUMPTION |
| Minimum cure time before vehicle loading | TBD (DB structural/civil to specify; no vehicle loading before cure requirement is met) | ASSUMPTION [Lensing item X-004] |

### Opening Axis Decision

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Axis (long 100' walls vs. short 60' ends) | TBD -- DB to determine based on site access routing, equipment turning radii, and prevailing wind orientation | OSR §10.2 (p.36); ASSUMPTION |
| Decision criteria | Site traffic flow (PKG-003), equipment turning radii for graders/tandem dump trucks, building orientation relative to prevailing winds (cold air infiltration), coordination with DEL-04-01 | ASSUMPTION [Lensing item B-003] |
| Resolution pathway | DB to confirm with Owner input per DEL-04-01 and PKG-003 site layout; document in DEL-04-01 design basis | ASSUMPTION [Lensing item B-003] |
