## Requirements

### REQ-4202-01: Overhead Door Quantity and Location
The cold storage building shall be provided with two (2) overhead doors, one on each of two opposite sides of the building.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.2 (p.36); SOW-0302

### REQ-4202-02: Overhead Door Size
Each overhead door shall be 16' wide x 16' high.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.41)

### REQ-4202-03: Overhead Door Window Profile
Each overhead door shall incorporate a window profile identical to the overhead doors on the main Public Services Building.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.41)

**Note:** The OSR describes the main building overhead doors as having windows of "material suitable for the direction the doors face (poly vs metal for natural lighting)" (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.41). The Design-Builder shall select the appropriate glazing material for the cold storage overhead doors based on door orientation, consistent with this principle. This requirement supports OBJ-004 (campus aesthetic coherence); see Guidance P2 for rationale.

### REQ-4202-04: Overhead Door Openers
All overhead doors shall be equipped with motorized openers with remote control capability.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.41-42)

### REQ-4202-05: Overhead Door Hardware Grade
Hardware for the cold storage building overhead doors shall be standard grade.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.41-42)

### REQ-4202-06: Person Door Quantity and Location
The cold storage building shall be provided with two (2) person doors, one on each of the two opposite sides that also contain the overhead doors.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.2 (p.36); Section 10.3.9 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-07: Person Door Lock Hardware
Each person door shall be equipped with a keyed deadbolt door lock.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-08: Key Commonality
The deadbolt key for the cold storage building person doors shall be the same as the key for the pickled-sand storage building, to allow ease of access across ancillary buildings.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-09: Person Door Building Code Compliance
Person doors shall be adequate to meet applicable building code requirements for egress, size, and hardware.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.9 (p.41)

**Note:** The Design-Builder shall confirm the applicable Alberta Building Code (ABC) edition and verify minimum door width, swing direction, and egress hardware requirements against that edition before detailed design submission. ASSUMPTION: code-minimum commercial egress dimensions apply (indicative 32" wide x 80" high minimum per typical ABC commercial egress requirements). [Lensing item A-003]

### REQ-4202-10: Concrete Aprons at Overhead Doors
Concrete aprons shall be provided at all overhead door access points. Aprons shall be designed to support the weight and operation of service vehicles expected to use the facility.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.10 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-11: Emergency Exit Lighting at Person Doors
Emergency exit lights shall be installed above each person door. Exit lights shall include internal batteries per applicable code requirements.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.5 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-12: Weatherproof Switches at Person Doors
Light switches at person door locations shall be weatherproof.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.5 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-13: Vehicle Clearance
The overhead door opening height and structural clearance shall be sufficient to accommodate typical Public Works equipment, including graders, tandem dump trucks, loaders, and bobcats.

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.5 (p.40); Section 10.3.9 (p.41)

**Note:** The 16'x16' opening dimension is specified (REQ-4202-02). The Design-Builder shall verify this clears the equipment inventory expected to use the cold storage building by documenting the actual equipment list and their maximum heights against the 16' door opening (see Procedure for verification step). ASSUMPTION: 16' clear height satisfies Public Works equipment clearance for this building. [Lensing item F-003]

### REQ-4202-14: Electrical Coordination for Door Openers
The overhead door opener electrical requirements shall be coordinated with the electrical system design for the cold storage building (DEL-04-04).

**Source:** OSR Section 10.4 (p.42)

### REQ-4202-15: Overhead Door Wind-Load Rating
TBD -- The Design-Builder shall confirm whether overhead doors (16'x16' openings) require a wind-load rating per Alberta Building Code for the Penhold, Alberta location. Given the large opening size and Alberta climate conditions, wind-load performance is a regulatory threshold consideration. If no specific rating is required by code, this shall be explicitly documented. ASSUMPTION: wind-load rating may be required for 16'x16' overhead doors in Alberta; DB to confirm per applicable ABC edition. [Lensing item C-002]

**Source:** OSR Section 10.3.5 (p.40) (building loads reference); ASSUMPTION

### REQ-4202-16: Fire Separation at Door Openings
TBD -- The Design-Builder shall confirm whether any fire separation rating is required at door openings between the cold storage building and any adjacent structure, per Alberta Building Code. If the cold storage building is a standalone structure with no fire separation requirements (standalone unheated ancillary building), this shall be explicitly stated in the design narrative. ASSUMPTION: as a standalone building, fire separation at door openings may not be required; AHJ to confirm. [Lensing item C-001]

**Source:** ASSUMPTION; ABC (not directly accessed -- location TBD)

### REQ-4202-17: Weatherstripping and Sealing at Door Openings
Overhead doors and person doors shall be provided with weatherstripping/sealing appropriate for an unheated building in Alberta conditions. Sealing shall be sufficient to limit snow infiltration and support operational usability of the building.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION; Procedure Step A4 references weatherstripping for person door hardware sets; Guidance C5 addresses weatherproof requirements. [Lensing item C-003]

### REQ-4202-18: Concrete Apron Minimum Cure Time
Concrete aprons shall not be subjected to vehicle loading until a minimum cure time has been achieved, as specified by the structural/civil designer. The minimum cure time and any early loading restrictions shall be documented in the construction specifications.

**Source:** ASSUMPTION; Procedure Step B8 references cure time requirement. [Lensing item X-004]
