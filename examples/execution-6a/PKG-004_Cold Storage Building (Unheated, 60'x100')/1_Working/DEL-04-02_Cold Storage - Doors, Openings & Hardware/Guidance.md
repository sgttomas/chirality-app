# Guidance: DEL-04-02 Cold Storage — Doors, Openings & Hardware

## Terminology

> **Note:** This deliverable uses "person doors" as the standard term throughout all four documents. The OSR and some project documents also use "man doors." These terms are synonymous. The term "person doors" is preferred for consistency. [Lensing item B-004]

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to define the door schedule and hardware basis for the unheated cold storage building (60'x100') in sufficient detail for the proposal submission. The cold storage building serves as a covered storage solution for seasonal Public Works equipment, materials, and supplies.

The Owner requires openings on two opposite sides to support practical through-access for loading/unloading and equipment movement (OSR Section 10.2, p.36). The window profile alignment requirement ensures the cold storage building reads as architecturally coherent with the main Public Services Building, directly supporting OBJ-004: "Deliver the unheated cold storage building (60'x100') with practical access, moisture management, and door configuration compatible with the main building" (Decomposition, OBJ-004). The hardware and opener specifications are sized for a practical, low-maintenance ancillary building appropriate for public works operations.

**Source:** Decomposition -- OBJ-004, SOW-0302; OSR Section 10.2 (p.36), Section 10.3.9 (pp.41-42)

## Principles

### P1: Bilateral Access Configuration
The two-opposite-sides opening layout is explicitly required by the Owner (OSR Section 10.2, p.36). This configuration enables drive-through movement of Public Works equipment (e.g., tractors, loaders, bobcats), eliminating the need to reverse large vehicles inside the building. The Design-Builder should position the two openings on the long sides (100' walls) or short ends (60' walls) based on site access routing -- the OSR does not specify which axis. ASSUMPTION: the axis of access should align with site traffic flow as established in DEL-04-01 and PKG-003 site works.

### P2: Profile Consistency with Main Building (OBJ-004 Linkage)
The overhead door window profile must be identical to the main building (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.41). This ensures visual coherence across the facility, which directly supports OBJ-004's requirement for "door configuration compatible with the main building" (Decomposition, OBJ-004). The window profile match contributes to a turnkey campus appearance (OSR Section 10.2.1, p.37) by ensuring that the cold storage building, although an unheated ancillary structure, reads as part of the same facility when viewed from the site approach. The window material (poly vs. metal) should be selected based on door orientation and natural lighting needs, consistent with the main building approach. The merit of this requirement is assessed through the documented specification cross-reference artifact (see Specification REQ-4202-03 verification). ASSUMPTION: the Design-Builder will cross-reference the main building door specification (PKG-002) to confirm exact window panel configuration. [Lensing item D-002]

### P3: Standard Grade Hardware — Appropriately Scoped
The OSR explicitly assigns standard grade hardware to the cold storage building and "car wash" grade hardware to the main building (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.41-42). This distinction is deliberate -- the cold storage building is an unheated ancillary structure with lower use intensity and no vehicle wash environment. Standard grade hardware is appropriate for this context and the 20-year design life because: (a) the cold storage building is expected to experience significantly lower daily cycle counts than the main building's apparatus bays, (b) the unheated environment, while exposing hardware to freeze-thaw cycling, does not subject it to the corrosive vehicle-wash environment that drives the main building's "car wash" grade requirement, and (c) standard grade commercial hardware with galvanized or zinc-plated finish (see C4) is commonly rated for 15-25 year service life under similar conditions -- ASSUMPTION based on general industry practice; no project-specific lifecycle cost data is available. The Design-Builder should not over-specify hardware for cost efficiency, nor under-specify in a way that would compromise long-term durability. TBD: lifecycle cost estimate or maintenance interval projection for standard grade hardware in this environment, to substantiate the 20-year adequacy assumption. [Lensing items A-005, F-004]

### P4: Key Commonality Across Ancillary Buildings
The keyed deadbolt locks on the cold storage person doors must use the same key as the pickled-sand storage building (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.42). This is an operational ease-of-access requirement for public works and fire department staff who may need to access either building. The Design-Builder must coordinate the keying scheme across both buildings to ensure this is achievable in the final hardware specification.

### P5: Building Code Adequacy for Egress
Person doors must meet applicable building code requirements (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.41). For an unheated storage building in Alberta, this includes minimum door width, swing direction, and egress hardware. Emergency exit lights with internal batteries are required above each person door (OSR Section 10.5, p.42). The Design-Builder should confirm requirements with the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) during detailed design.

## Considerations

### C1: Door Opening Axis — Not Specified in OSR
The OSR states openings on "two opposite sides" but does not specify whether these are the long sides (100') or short ends (60') of the building. This is an essential decision that affects equipment routing, wind exposure, concrete apron orientation, and drainage design for the entire deliverable. The Design-Builder must select the axis based on:
- Site access routing (relationship to yard and driveway network -- see PKG-003/DEL-03-02)
- Equipment turning radii for the largest expected vehicles (graders, tandem dump trucks)
- Building orientation relative to prevailing winds (to reduce cold air infiltration through overhead doors)
- Coordination with site grading and drainage (PKG-003)

ASSUMPTION: this decision is delegated to the Design-Builder with Owner input and should be documented in DEL-04-01 (Design Basis & Configuration). A resolution deadline should be established early in the proposal phase to avoid cascading impacts on other deliverables. [Lensing item B-003]

### C2: Concrete Apron Design — Loading Basis
Aprons at overhead door access points must support service vehicle loads (OSR Section 10.3.10, p.42). The Design-Builder should determine apron dimensions, thickness, and reinforcing based on the heaviest expected vehicle (likely a tandem dump truck or loader). Apron design should coordinate with the floor system in DEL-04-03 (Cold Storage -- Floor & Foundation).

### C3: Overhead Door Opener Power Supply
Motorized openers require electrical power at each door. The Design-Builder must coordinate rough-in for overhead door operator power with the electrical design (DEL-04-04). This includes confirming panel capacity and outlet location.

### C4: 20-Year Design Life Implications for Hardware
The cold storage building has a 20-year design life (ancillary building, OSR Section 10.2, p.36). Standard grade hardware should be selected with longevity in this environment in mind -- particularly for components exposed to freeze-thaw cycling, Alberta winters, and the unheated interior. ASSUMPTION: hardware should be at minimum commercial/standard grade with galvanized or zinc-plated finish appropriate for exterior/cold storage use. TBD: the Design-Builder should provide a lifecycle cost estimate or maintenance interval projection for the proposed hardware in an unheated Alberta environment, to confirm that standard grade hardware will not require premature replacement within the 20-year design life. If replacement is expected (e.g., at 10-15 year intervals), this should be documented as part of the Owner's maintenance expectations. [Lensing items A-005, F-004]

### C5: Weatherproof Requirements at Person Doors
Light switches at person door locations must be weatherproof (OSR Section 10.5, p.42). Since the cold storage building is unheated, interior conditions will be similar to exterior in winter. All electrical devices at person door locations (switches, exit lights) should be rated for the temperature range expected in an unheated Alberta structure.

### C6: Concrete Apron Drainage Direction and Coordination
Concrete aprons at overhead doors must be designed with positive drainage away from the building (see Procedure Step B8 and Procedure verification table). The drainage direction and slope of the aprons should be coordinated with the overall site grading and drainage design (PKG-003/DEL-03-02) to ensure apron runoff does not create ponding, ice hazards, or conflict with the site drainage plan. This consideration is particularly important for an unheated building in Alberta where freeze-thaw cycling can exacerbate drainage deficiencies. The Design-Builder (civil) should address apron drainage direction as part of the site grading coordination with PKG-003, establishing the minimum drainage slope and confirming positive drainage is achievable given site topography. ASSUMPTION: the apron drainage slope will be established during detailed design in coordination with site grading. [Lensing item X-001]

## Trade-offs

### T1: Overhead Door Size vs. Vehicle Clearance
The 16'x16' overhead door dimension is explicitly specified by the Owner (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.41). This matches the main building. The Design-Builder should verify that 16' clear height accommodates the tallest expected equipment using the cold storage building. If equipment taller than the opening is identified, this should be flagged as a potential conflict for Owner resolution before detailed design is finalized.

**Tension:** Owner-specified fixed dimension vs. actual equipment clearance needs.
**Resolution:** Per OSR, 16'x16' is specified -- treat as a hard requirement unless confirmed otherwise by the Owner.

### T2: Window Profile in Overhead Doors — Poly vs. Metal
The OSR notes that window material for the main building doors is selected based on door face direction (poly vs. metal for natural lighting, OSR Section 10.3.9, p.41). For the cold storage building, the same principle applies. Metal-framed windows offer durability; poly (polycarbonate) panels offer better natural light transmission. For an unheated storage building, polycarbonate is generally preferred for natural lighting and cost, but the Design-Builder should confirm based on orientation.

**Tension:** Thermal performance (minimal in an unheated building) vs. natural lighting vs. cost.
**Resolution:** ASSUMPTION: poly glazing is appropriate for the cold storage building given the unheated environment and natural lighting benefit. DB to confirm based on door face orientation.

### T3: Keying — Master Key vs. Common Key
The OSR requires the same key across the cold storage and pickled-sand buildings (OSR Section 10.3.9, p.42). This simplifies operations but reduces the ability to restrict access independently to each building. Given these are ancillary public works storage buildings (not high-security areas), the common-key approach is operationally appropriate.

**Tension:** Operational simplicity vs. access differentiation.
**Resolution:** OSR explicitly requires same-key -- treat as a hard requirement.
