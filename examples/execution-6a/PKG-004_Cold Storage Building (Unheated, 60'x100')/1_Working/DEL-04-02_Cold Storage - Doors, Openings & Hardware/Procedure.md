# Procedure: DEL-04-02 Cold Storage — Doors, Openings & Hardware

## Purpose

This procedure describes two complementary processes:

1. **Production Process** -- Steps to produce the Door Schedule, Hardware Basis, and related artifacts required for the DEL-04-02 proposal deliverable.
2. **Implementation Process** -- Steps for detailed design, construction, and commissioning of the cold storage doors, openings, and hardware through the project lifecycle.

## Steps

### Part A: Proposal Phase — Producing the Deliverable Artifacts

**Step A1: Confirm Building Orientation and Opening Sides**
- Review DEL-04-01 concept design or site layout (PKG-003) to determine which two sides of the cold storage building will receive the overhead door and person door openings.
- Document the selected axis (long sides vs. short ends) and rationale in the door schedule notes or a design basis narrative.
- Consider site access routing, equipment turning radii, prevailing wind orientation, and site drainage coordination (see Guidance C1, C6).
- If DEL-04-01 is not yet available, document the opening axis as ASSUMPTION and flag for resolution with a target resolution deadline.

**Step A2: Establish Overhead Door Basis**
- Confirm door quantity: 2 overhead doors (one per opposite side), per OSR Section 10.3.9.
- Confirm door size: 16' wide x 16' high nominal, per OSR Section 10.3.9.
- Select window profile basis: poly vs. metal glazing per door face orientation, consistent with the main building specification.
- Confirm opener type: motorized with remote control, per OSR Section 10.3.9.
- Confirm hardware grade: standard grade, per OSR Section 10.3.9.
- Record manufacturer basis of design (for proposal purposes -- final selection may be revised at detailed design).

**Step A3: Establish Person Door Basis**
- Confirm door quantity: 2 person doors (one per opposite side, co-located with overhead door openings), per OSR Section 10.2 and Section 10.3.9.
- Confirm lock type: keyed deadbolt, per OSR Section 10.3.9.
- Note key commonality requirement: same key as pickled-sand storage building, per OSR Section 10.3.9.
- Confirm code compliance intent: doors to meet Alberta Building Code requirements for egress. Note specific code edition and confirm with AHJ at detailed design phase.
- Establish nominal door size (ASSUMPTION: code minimum for egress; DB to confirm -- typically 32" wide x 80" high minimum for commercial egress in ABC).

**Step A4: Establish Hardware Schedule Basis**
- Define hardware sets for overhead doors (opener, operator hardware, track hardware, safety features) -- standard grade.
- Define hardware sets for person doors (deadbolt lock, door closer if required by code, threshold, weatherstripping).
- Establish keying scheme: cold storage building and pickled-sand building to share a common key -- coordinate with hardware supplier.
- Confirm with Owner whether keying scheme extends to any additional ancillary buildings or the main building (see Datasheet, Lensing item E-002).
- Note finish requirements: suitable for unheated exterior-grade environment (Alberta winters, freeze-thaw cycling); ASSUMPTION: galvanized or zinc-plated standard.

**Step A5: Establish Concrete Apron Basis**
- Confirm apron locations: at each overhead door access point (2 locations), per OSR Section 10.3.10.
- Establish loading basis: sized to support service vehicle weights (graders, tandem dump trucks, loaders). Note coordination with floor/foundation design (DEL-04-03).
- Establish apron extent: TBD by structural/civil design -- minimum sufficient for full vehicle approach and safe door operation. Document as TBD for proposal; provide indicative dimensions if available.
- Note minimum cure time requirement before vehicle loading (see Specification REQ-4202-18).
- Note drainage direction requirement: positive drainage away from building, coordinated with site grading (PKG-003/DEL-03-02; see Guidance C6).

**Step A6: Confirm Emergency Exit Light and Switch Basis**
- Confirm emergency exit lights above each person door with internal batteries, per OSR Section 10.5.
- Confirm weatherproof switches at person door locations, per OSR Section 10.5.
- Cross-reference with DEL-04-04 electrical design for circuit routing.

**Step A7: Compile Door Schedule**
- Prepare door schedule tabular document listing each door by:
  - Mark/Tag (e.g., D-CS-01, D-CS-02 for overhead; D-CS-03, D-CS-04 for person doors)
  - Type (overhead or person)
  - Nominal size (width x height)
  - Material/construction
  - Hardware set reference
  - Opener type (if overhead)
  - Special requirements (window profile, key type, code compliance notes, weatherstripping)
- Include notes on window profile match with main building and key commonality.

**Step A8: Compile Hardware Basis Statement**
- Prepare a brief hardware basis-of-design statement summarizing:
  - Hardware grade (standard)
  - Keying scheme (common key across cold storage and pickled-sand buildings; scope confirmation from Owner)
  - Manufacturer basis or approved equal (for proposal purposes)
  - Finish standard (galvanized or zinc-plated for unheated environment -- ASSUMPTION)
  - Code compliance reference

**Step A9: Prepare Vehicle Clearance Confirmation**
- Document the equipment inventory expected to use the cold storage building (graders, tandem dump trucks, loaders, bobcats) with their maximum heights.
- Compare maximum equipment heights against the 16' overhead door opening height.
- Retain a clearance confirmation artifact (table or narrative) documenting the comparison result.
- If any equipment exceeds 16' clear height, flag for Owner resolution per Guidance T1.
[Lensing item F-003]

**Step A10: Cross-Check with Other PKG-004 Deliverables**
- Confirm rough opening sizes in door schedule are consistent with structural framing (DEL-04-01).
- Confirm apron design intent is consistent with floor/foundation approach (DEL-04-03).
- Confirm electrical power requirements for door openers are noted for DEL-04-04 coordination.

**Step A11: Internal Review**
- Review door schedule and hardware basis against all requirements in Specification.md (REQ-4202-01 through REQ-4202-18).
- Confirm all OSR requirements are addressed or explicitly noted as TBD with reason.
- Confirm cross-document consistency with Datasheet.md values.
