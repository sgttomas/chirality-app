**Intermediate collection:**
```
k=guiding:   Grounded Value Direction * Foundational Directive Basis = "value-anchored foundation"
k=applying:  Substantiated Merit Delivery * Critical Practice Mandate = "mandated merit"
k=judging:   Comprehensive Merit Judgment * Critical Determination Basis = "decisive worth"
k=reviewing: Harmonized Quality Oversight * Mandatory Assurance Baseline = "quality imperative"
```
`L_E(evaluative, necessity) = {value-anchored foundation, mandated merit, decisive worth, quality imperative}`

**Step 1:** `a = evaluative * necessity = essential worth`

**Step 2:**
```
p_1 = essential worth * value-anchored foundation = "fundamental value grounding"
p_2 = essential worth * mandated merit = "obligatory quality"
p_3 = essential worth * decisive worth = "non-negotiable value"
p_4 = essential worth * quality imperative = "indispensable assurance"
```

**Step 3:** Centroid of {fundamental value grounding, obligatory quality, non-negotiable value, indispensable assurance} -> `u = "Non-Negotiable Value Assurance"`

#### Cell E(evaluative, sufficiency)

**Intermediate collection:**
```
k=guiding:   Grounded Value Direction * Validated Guidance Sufficiency = "sufficient value guidance"
k=applying:  Substantiated Merit Delivery * Demonstrated Delivery Adequacy = "proven merit delivery"
k=judging:   Comprehensive Merit Judgment * Evidence-Based Adjudication = "evidence-grounded merit"
k=reviewing: Harmonized Quality Oversight * Validated Oversight Adequacy = "adequate quality assurance"
```
`L_E(evaluative, sufficiency) = {sufficient value guidance, proven merit delivery, evidence-grounded merit, adequate quality assurance}`

**Step 1:** `a = evaluative * sufficiency = adequate worth`

**Step 2:**
```
p_1 = adequate worth * sufficient value guidance = "adequate value direction"
p_2 = adequate worth * proven merit delivery = "demonstrated quality"
p_3 = adequate worth * evidence-grounded merit = "substantiated appraisal"
p_4 = adequate worth * adequate quality assurance = "sufficient merit assurance"
```

**Step 3:** Centroid of {adequate value direction, demonstrated quality, substantiated appraisal, sufficient merit assurance} -> `u = "Demonstrated Value Sufficiency"`

#### Cell E(evaluative, completeness)

**Intermediate collection:**
```
k=guiding:   Grounded Value Direction * Exhaustive Guidance Coverage = "total value direction"
k=applying:  Substantiated Merit Delivery * Comprehensive Implementation Scope = "full merit delivery"
k=judging:   Comprehensive Merit Judgment * Exhaustive Adjudication Scope = "total worth ruling"
k=reviewing: Harmonized Quality Oversight * Exhaustive Assurance Coverage = "complete quality audit"
```
`L_E(evaluative, completeness) = {total value direction, full merit delivery, total worth ruling, complete quality audit}`

**Step 1:** `a = evaluative * completeness = total worth`

**Step 2:**
```
p_1 = total worth * total value direction = "exhaustive value scope"
p_2 = total worth * full merit delivery = "comprehensive merit"
p_3 = total worth * total worth ruling = "absolute valuation"
p_4 = total worth * complete quality audit = "whole-quality accounting"
```

**Step 3:** Centroid of {exhaustive value scope, comprehensive merit, absolute valuation, whole-quality accounting} -> `u = "Absolute Value Completeness"`

#### Cell E(evaluative, consistency)

**Intermediate collection:**
```
k=guiding:   Grounded Value Direction * Principled Guidance Coherence = "principled value guidance"
k=applying:  Substantiated Merit Delivery * Consistent Execution Standard = "uniform merit delivery"
k=judging:   Comprehensive Merit Judgment * Coherent Adjudication Standard = "coherent worth ruling"
k=reviewing: Harmonized Quality Oversight * Systematic Assurance Governance = "systematic quality governance"
```
`L_E(evaluative, consistency) = {principled value guidance, uniform merit delivery, coherent worth ruling, systematic quality governance}`

**Step 1:** `a = evaluative * consistency = coherent worth`

**Step 2:**
```
p_1 = coherent worth * principled value guidance = "principled merit direction"
p_2 = coherent worth * uniform merit delivery = "consistent value transfer"
p_3 = coherent worth * coherent worth ruling = "harmonized valuation"
p_4 = coherent worth * systematic quality governance = "disciplined quality coherence"
```

**Step 3:** Centroid of {principled merit direction, consistent value transfer, harmonized valuation, disciplined quality coherence} -> `u = "Disciplined Value Governance"`
