**Status:** Informational constraint — confirm with AHJ during permitting process.

### REQ-04-01-008 — Openings Configuration (Summary for Coordination)
**Requirement:** The building shall have openings on two opposite sides. Each side shall include one overhead door (16'×16') and one person door. Full door/hardware specifications are in DEL-04-02; this deliverable establishes the configuration basis for general arrangement.
**Source:** OSR §10.2; OSR §10.3.9.
**Status:** Mandatory. Cross-reference DEL-04-02 for door schedule requirements.

### REQ-04-01-009 — Aesthetic Coordination with Main Building
**Requirement:** The overhead door window profile shall be identical to the main building overhead doors. Person door hardware shall use the same key as the main building (keyed deadbolt) for ease of access. The overall external appearance of the cold storage building shall coordinate with the main building aesthetic.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.9.
**Status:** Mandatory (window profile and key match); broader aesthetic coordination is a design objective.

### REQ-04-01-010 — Weather-Tight Envelope
**Requirement:** The roof and exterior structure shall be made of weather-tight materials preventing water and moisture from entering the building. The building envelope shall be watertight at joints, non-combustible in construction, and of durable, flexible materials appropriate for general storage operations.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.9; OSR §11.3.
**Status:** Mandatory.

### REQ-04-01-011 — Condensation and Icing Prevention
**Requirement:** The building shall incorporate adequate ventilation or alternate air circulation to prevent condensation and icing within the cold storage space.
**Source:** OSR §11.1.2; SOW-0300.
**Status:** Mandatory. Design approach (ventilation type/placement) to be proposed by DB and detailed in DEL-04-04.
**Performance Criterion (TBD):** DB shall propose measurable acceptance criteria for ventilation adequacy (e.g., "ventilation system shall maintain interior relative humidity below the condensation threshold for the lowest anticipated interior surface temperature during winter storage conditions," or equivalent performance standard). The acceptance criterion shall be submitted for Owner review during design development. **ASSUMPTION:** Quantitative ventilation performance criteria are required but the specific threshold must be established by the DB based on engineering analysis of the unheated building's thermal and moisture behavior. (Ref: Lensing item X-002; source: Specification.md REQ-04-01-011; OSR §11.1.2.)

### REQ-04-01-012 — Positive Drainage Away from Building
**Requirement:** Grading and drainage around the cold storage building shall ensure positive drainage away from the building. Since there is no storm sewer on-site, roof and site drainage shall be directed to appropriate natural drainage off-site.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.2; OSR §11.2.
**Status:** Mandatory. Detailed design in PKG-003 (site and civil works); building-level coordination required.

### REQ-04-01-013 — Concrete Aprons at Overhead Door Access Points
**Requirement:** Concrete aprons shall be provided at all overhead door access points to the cold storage building. Aprons shall be designed to support the weight and operation of service vehicles expected to use the facility.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.10.
**Status:** Mandatory. Floor/apron interface with building is also addressed in DEL-04-03.

### REQ-04-01-014 — Site Placement Within Developable Area
**Requirement:** The cold storage building shall be located within the 12-acre developable area of the PSB site. The preferred siting shall reference the ideal cold storage location identified in the Addendum 03 site map. Precise placement shall be confirmed during design in coordination with PKG-003 site and civil works.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.1.
**Status:** Mandatory (within developable area); precise location is DB-proposed subject to design coordination.
**Note — Fire Separation / Spatial Separation (TBD):** The cold storage building site placement must satisfy ABC spatial separation distance requirements from the main building (and any other buildings on the same property). DB shall confirm that the proposed location meets ABC fire separation/spatial separation requirements and document the analysis. If the preferred Addendum 03 location does not satisfy ABC spatial separation, an alternate location within the developable area must be proposed. **ASSUMPTION:** ABC spatial separation requirements apply to buildings on the same property; the specific requirements depend on occupancy classification and building construction type. (Ref: Lensing item F-002; source: Specification.md REQ-04-01-014, REQ-04-01-015; ABC, location TBD.)

### REQ-04-01-015 — Code Compliance and Permits
**Requirement:** The cold storage building design and construction shall comply with all applicable Alberta Building Code (ABC) requirements, applicable provincial/municipal standards, and all other governing codes and regulations. Design-Builder shall obtain all required permits and inspections.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.2; RFP §7.1.2; RFP §7.2 (Permits).
**Status:** Mandatory.
**Note — Accessibility (TBD):** Confirm whether ABC barrier-free accessibility requirements apply to the cold storage building. As an unheated ancillary storage building with person doors, the building may qualify for an accessibility exemption under ABC; however, this should be explicitly confirmed with the AHJ rather than assumed. DB shall document the accessibility determination (exemption basis or applicable requirements) during the permitting process. **ASSUMPTION:** An unheated storage building may be exempt from barrier-free access requirements, but confirmation is needed. (Ref: Lensing item E-001; source: Specification.md REQ-04-01-015; ABC, location TBD.)
