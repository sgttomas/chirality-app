# Deliverable: DEL-04-01 Cold Storage -- Design Basis & Configuration

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the design basis, spatial configuration, and structural framing concept for an unheated clear-span cold storage building. It must carry knowledge about how building massing, structural system selection, envelope integrity, and aesthetic coordination with a parent facility collectively define a utilitarian storage structure's fitness for purpose. Downstream door, floor, foundation, and MEP deliverables build upon this foundational architectural and structural knowledge.

**E(evaluative, sufficiency):**
- Step 1: a = evaluative * sufficiency = "value adequacy"
- Step 2:
  - p1 = value adequacy * adequate value guidance = "sufficient merit steering"
  - p2 = value adequacy * proven merit range = "demonstrated worth scope"
  - p3 = value adequacy * balanced worth coverage = "proportionate value range"
  - p4 = value adequacy * audited valuation fitness = "verified appraisal adequacy"
- Step 3: Centroid of {sufficient merit steering, demonstrated worth scope, proportionate value range, verified appraisal adequacy} -> u = "Demonstrated Worth Fitness"

**E(evaluative, completeness):**
- Step 1: a = evaluative * completeness = "total value scope"
- Step 2:
  - p1 = total value scope * total value steering = "exhaustive merit direction"
  - p2 = total value scope * complete merit deployment = "full worth realization"
  - p3 = total value scope * full worth assessment = "total valuation evaluation"
  - p4 = total value scope * total appraisal verification = "comprehensive merit review"
- Step 3: Centroid of {exhaustive merit direction, full worth realization, total valuation evaluation, comprehensive merit review} -> u = "Total Valuation Assurance"

**E(evaluative, consistency):**
- Step 1: a = evaluative * consistency = "value coherence"
- Step 2:
  - p1 = value coherence * aligned value steering = "harmonized merit direction"
  - p2 = value coherence * uniform merit practice = "consistent worth application"
  - p3 = value coherence * principled worth order = "disciplined valuation standard"
  - p4 = value coherence * coherent appraisal review = "unified merit examination"
- Step 3: Centroid of {harmonized merit direction, consistent worth application, disciplined valuation standard, unified merit examination} -> u = "Disciplined Valuation Coherence"
