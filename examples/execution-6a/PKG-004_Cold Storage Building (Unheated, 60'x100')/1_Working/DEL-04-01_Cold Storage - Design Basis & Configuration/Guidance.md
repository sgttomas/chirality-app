## Purpose

This deliverable establishes the design basis and overall configuration concept for the unheated cold storage building at the Town of Penhold Public Services Building site. It exists to:

1. Confirm the agreed building size (60'×100' clear-span) and demonstrate that the proposed structural framing concept achieves an unobstructed interior for seasonal equipment and materials storage.
2. Establish how the cold storage building integrates aesthetically and functionally with the main building (door profile coordination, key matching).
3. Provide the evaluator (Town of Penhold) with sufficient design information — general arrangement, elevations, sections, framing concept — to assess the DB's approach to OBJ-004 (delivering practical access, moisture management, and compatible door configuration).
4. Serve as the foundational design document that downstream DEL-04-02 (doors/openings/hardware), DEL-04-03 (floor and foundation), and DEL-04-04 (electrical and ventilation) build upon.

## Principles

### P1 — Clear Span is Non-Negotiable
The 60'×100' footprint with full clear-span interior is an Owner-confirmed, Gate 2-approved dimension (DEC-001). It supersedes any earlier Functional Program dimensions (e.g., 30'×40'). The DB's structural solution must deliver an unobstructed interior floor area. This is the highest-priority configuration constraint for this deliverable.
**Source:** OSR §10.2; SOW-0301; DEC-001.

### P2 — Cost-Effective Structural Solution is Preferred
The OSR explicitly states no foundation or structural framing preference for the cold storage building, and uses post-and-frame (pole shed) as an example of an acceptable approach. The DB is encouraged to pursue the most cost-effective, code-compliant clear-span solution. Optional or alternative solutions may be presented (priced separately) but one primary proposal is required.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.6; DEC-002; DEC-003.

### P3 — Aesthetic Integration with the Main Building is Required
The cold storage building must coordinate visually with the main building, specifically: overhead door window profiles must be identical to the main building, and person door hardware must share the same key. This coordination signals to the Owner that the site will have a cohesive appearance and practical operational consistency (one key for all buildings). The DB should address aesthetic coordination in elevations and a short coordination note.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.9; OBJ-004.

### P4 — Moisture Management is a Core Design Consideration
As an unheated structure in an Alberta climate, condensation and icing are the primary building performance risks. The design must incorporate adequate ventilation or air circulation from the outset — this should be reflected in the building configuration (location/sizing of openings, ventilation paths) even though MEP detail is in DEL-04-04. The building envelope must also be weather-tight.
**Source:** OSR §11.1.2; OSR §10.3.9; OSR §11.3; SOW-0300.

### P5 — Practical Operational Access Drives Massing Decisions
The cold storage building serves the same fleet types as the main building (Public Works equipment). The height and opening configuration must enable safe truck and loader access for loading and unloading. Height is stated as "minimum height" in the OSR, but the DB must verify minimum height is sufficient for the expected equipment envelope.
**Source:** OSR §10.2; OSR §10.3.4; OSR §10.3.5.

### P6 — 20-Year Design Life Sets Material Selection Context
The OSR specifies 20-year life expectancy for ancillary storage buildings (versus 50-year for the main building). This creates an opportunity for cost-effective material choices relative to the main building, while still meeting "durable, flexible materials for longevity and easy maintenance" criteria.

## Considerations

### C1 — Structural Framing Options
The OSR specifically names post-and-frame (pole shed) construction as an example for cold storage. Pre-engineered metal building systems are another common clear-span solution for this size range. The DB should consider:
- **Pole shed (post-and-frame):** Lower upfront cost, fast erection, good for agricultural/storage buildings; foundation may be minimal (embedded posts or surface piers); suitable for 20-year life.
- **Pre-engineered metal building (PEMB):** Factory-fabricated, predictable lead times, clear-span widths up to and exceeding 100' are routine; higher initial cost than pole shed but more predictable performance.
- **Structural considerations:** Both system types are workable for 60'×100' at minimum height in Alberta climate. Snow load, wind uplift, and lateral bracing requirements for Penhold, AB should be confirmed per Alberta Building Code.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.6; ASSUMPTION (comparison of system types is general engineering knowledge applied to OSR context).

### C1a — Geotechnical Considerations for Foundation/Framing Selection
The Geotechnical Investigation Report (RFP Appendix D) provides site ground conditions data. The DB is responsible for adequacy of geotechnical information (per Datasheet Conditions table). The choice of structural framing system has direct implications for geotechnical requirements and long-term foundation performance:

**Pole Shed (Embedded Posts):**
- Requires knowledge of soil bearing capacity at post embedment depth (typically 4'--6' below grade)
- Frost penetration depth is critical: posts must be embedded below seasonal frost line to prevent frost heave and post uplift
- Lateral soil resistance at embedment depth is needed for lateral load distribution (snow/wind)
- Geotechnical report should be reviewed for suitability of embedded post foundations at the proposed cold storage location
- If the report borehole locations do not align with the proposed building footprint, additional site-specific investigation may be warranted

**Pre-Engineered Metal Building (Conventional Foundations):**
- Requires slab-on-grade or pier/strip footing bearing capacity data
- Frost depth for footing design (frost line determines footing depth below grade)
- Settlement characteristics for the proposed location
- Concrete floor system must account for freeze-thaw cycling in an unheated building (air entrapment, durability)

**Frost Depth (Critical for Both Systems):**
Penhold, AB frost penetration depth is a critical design parameter for foundation selection. The DB should confirm the frost depth from:
- Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) site-specific borings, or
- Alberta Building Code Table 4.1.8.9 (frost penetration depth by region)
- Proposed cold storage location must be evaluated for subsurface conditions relative to available geotechnical data

**DB Responsibility for Adequacy:**
The DB should evaluate the Geotechnical Investigation Report for applicability to the cold storage building location specifically, as the report borehole locations may not coincide with the proposed building footprint. If additional geotechnical investigation is warranted for the cold storage location, this should be identified early in design development (preferably in Phase B after site placement is confirmed). **ASSUMPTION:** The Geotechnical Investigation Report (Appendix D) contains data relevant to the cold storage building area, but applicability to the specific building location should be confirmed by the DB.

### C2 — Building Height and Equipment Clearance
The OSR requires "minimum height" sufficient for fleet operations. The DB should verify height against the tallest Public Works equipment expected to use the space (e.g., based on the Public Works Critical Design Equipment List in Functional Program Appendix B -- the Elgin/Nissan Sweeper reaches 22' with raised hopper; graders are ~10'5" T). **ASSUMPTION:** The cold storage building is not intended to store the sweeper with raised hopper; however, DB should confirm with the Owner which specific equipment will be stored in the cold storage building versus the main building shop bays, as this determines minimum clear height. This confirmation should happen prior to finalizing structural framing design.

**TBD (External Input Required):** The Owner must confirm which specific Public Works equipment types will be stored in the cold storage building (versus the main building). This confirmation is a prerequisite for establishing the minimum clear height requirement (see REQ-04-01-003 Acceptance Criterion and Procedure Step A1). Until this input is received, the minimum clear height cannot be finalized. (Ref: Lensing item A-004; source: Guidance.md C2; Procedure.md Step A1.)

### C3 — Site Placement and Coordination with Site/Civil (PKG-003)
Addendum 03 identifies an "ideal cold storage location" on the site map (within the 12-acre developable area, near the main building). The DB should coordinate placement with:
- Access routes (aggregate yard/heavy equipment area per OSR §10.3.7)
- Drainage grading requirements (positive drainage away from building)
- Proximity to main building (for aesthetic coordination and operational convenience)
- Flood hazard constraints (cold storage must be outside the flood fringe)
- **Fire separation / spatial separation distance** from the main building per ABC requirements (see Specification REQ-04-01-014 note on spatial separation; Ref: Lensing item F-002)
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.1; OSR §10.3.7; SOW-0114.

### C4 — Ventilation Path in Building Configuration
Since the building is unheated and subject to temperature cycling, condensation on roof structure and stored equipment is a risk. The location and sizing of ventilation openings (e.g., ridge vent, gable vents, soffit vents, or mechanical exhaust) should be reflected in the general arrangement and section drawings produced by this deliverable. The specific mechanical ventilation specification is in DEL-04-04, but the DB should ensure the building configuration enables the chosen ventilation strategy.
**Source:** OSR §11.1.2; SOW-0300.

### C5 — Concrete Aprons and Floor Interface
Concrete aprons are required at all overhead door access points. The apron design must coordinate with the floor system proposed in DEL-04-03. If the floor is compacted asphalt millings (Option 1 from OSR), the transition detail between interior millings and exterior concrete apron needs careful design. If a full concrete floor is proposed, the apron may be a continuation of the floor slab. This coordination should be noted in the general arrangement drawings.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.10; OSR §10.3.8.

### C6 — Pickled Sand Storage is Out of Scope
The pickled sand/salt storage building is explicitly removed from this procurement per Addendum 03 §1.2 (DEC-006). References to the sand/salt building in the OSR (§10.3.6, §10.3.8, §11.1.3) are not applicable to the cold storage design. Care should be taken not to import sand/salt building requirements (e.g., corrosion-resistant materials, low-permeability floor, drainage containment) into the cold storage design.
**Source:** Addendum 03 §1.2; DEC-006; SOW-0400 (OUT).

## Trade-offs

### T1 — Cost vs. Structural System Selection
**Tension:** A pole shed is the lowest-cost option but may have a lower perceived quality ceiling. A pre-engineered metal building offers more predictable performance but at higher cost.
**Resolution:** The OSR explicitly names pole shed as acceptable with no preference, signaling cost-effectiveness is the priority. The DB should propose the most cost-effective solution that meets code and the 20-year life expectancy. Optional/alternate solutions may be priced separately.
**Rationale:** The cold storage building is a utilitarian storage structure, not a public-facing building; cost-effectiveness is explicitly valued by the Owner.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.6; DEC-003.

### T2 — Minimum Height vs. Maximum Equipment Clearance
**Tension:** Specifying minimum height minimizes structural cost and material volume, but risks providing inadequate clearance for future fleet changes or unanticipated equipment.
**Resolution:** The DB should confirm equipment types to be stored in cold storage (versus main building shop bays) and design to the actual maximum equipment envelope with reasonable headroom margin (e.g., 2'–3' clearance above tallest stored equipment). **ASSUMPTION:** A modest clearance buffer is appropriate given 20-year design life.
**Rationale:** Insufficient height would render the building operationally useless; the OSR intent is minimum height to support operations, not minimum height in an absolute engineering sense.
**Source:** OSR §10.2; OSR §10.3.4; OSR §10.3.5.

### T3 — Aesthetic Integration vs. Cost Differentiation
**Tension:** Full aesthetic matching to the main building may increase cost (e.g., matching cladding, similar roof profile). The OSR only mandates door window profile and key matching.
**Resolution:** The OSR requirement is limited to door window profile and hardware key. The DB may use a simpler, lower-cost cladding/roof system for the cold storage building while ensuring the door configuration is visually consistent. Brief coordination notes in the design package should explain the aesthetic approach.
**Rationale:** Cost-effectiveness for ancillary buildings is a project value; full aesthetic parity is not required.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.9; OBJ-004.

**Clarification -- Scope of "Aesthetic Coordination" (TBD for human ruling):** REQ-04-01-009 states the "overall external appearance shall coordinate with the main building aesthetic," but the OSR only explicitly mandates door window profile identity and key matching. The following aspects are ambiguous and should be clarified by the Owner:
- **Cladding color:** Must the cold storage cladding color match or complement the main building, or is it DB-discretionary?
- **Roof profile:** Must the cold storage roof pitch/profile visually coordinate with the main building, or may the DB select the most cost-effective profile?
- **Material type:** Must the cold storage exterior material type (e.g., metal siding) match the main building, or may the DB use a different system?

**ASSUMPTION:** Based on the OSR's emphasis on cost-effectiveness for ancillary buildings and the explicit naming of only door window profile and key match as mandatory coordination items, cladding color, roof profile, and material type are considered DB-discretionary unless the Owner directs otherwise. The DB should note the aesthetic approach in the coordination notes artifact. (Ref: Lensing item D-002; source: Specification.md REQ-04-01-009; Guidance.md T3; OSR §10.3.9.)

### T4 — Warranty Scope and 20-Year Design Life
**Tension:** The cold storage building has a 20-year design life (REQ-04-01-004), and Procedure records require warranty certificates for the structural system, doors, and roofing. However, typical manufacturer warranties for these components vary significantly:
- Structural steel framing: 1--5 years fabrication warranty (structural adequacy only, not durability)
- Pre-engineered metal building systems: 1--25 years depending on component (roof: 10--25 years; frame: 1--5 years)
- Metal roofing: 10--25 years material warranty (color/chalk; perforation is longer)
- Overhead doors: 1--5 years hardware/operator warranty

The 20-year design life does not necessarily imply a 20-year warranty period.

**Resolution:** The DB should:
1. Present warranty information for all major building systems (structural framing, roofing, doors) at closeout
2. Document how warranty coverage relates to the 20-year design life
3. Where warranty periods are shorter than the design life, describe the anticipated maintenance or replacement regime needed to achieve full 20-year service life (e.g., roof resealing at year 15, door operator replacement at year 10)
4. Prepare Operations and Maintenance manuals (Procedure Step D4) documenting expected service intervals and component lifespan assumptions

**Rationale:** The Owner needs to understand the relationship between component warranties and overall design life to plan for long-term maintenance of the cold storage building. A gap between warranty and design life is normal for this building type but should be documented transparently. The 20-year design life is the intended duration of the building structure itself; individual components (especially mechanical systems and hardware) may have shorter lifespans, requiring planned replacement or maintenance.

**Source:** OSR §10.2 (20-year design life); Specification REQ-04-01-004 (design life basis); Procedure.md Records table (warranty certificates) and Step D4 (O&M manuals). **ASSUMPTION:** Typical warranty periods for storage building components are shorter than 20 years; this is based on general industry practice, not project-specific data. (Ref: Lensing item X-003.)

## Examples

**Example — General Arrangement Content:**
A general arrangement drawing for this deliverable would typically include: plan view at 1:100 or 1:200 scale showing 60'×100' footprint, two opposite-side openings (each with overhead door and person door), proposed ventilation opening locations, and site orientation relative to access routes. This is illustrative of typical content; DB to follow professional practice standards.
**Source:** ASSUMPTION (professional practice standard for concept design packages of this type).

**Example — Framing Concept Narrative:**
A framing concept note would state the proposed structural system (e.g., "post-and-frame pole shed with engineered laminated timber columns at 8' on centre, steel purlin roof framing, metal cladding and roofing"), the clear-span dimension achieved, the design load basis (location: Penhold, AB ground snow load per ABC), and any key material choices. One paragraph is sufficient at concept stage.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No irreconcilable conflicts were identified between accessible sources for this deliverable. The following potential inconsistency is noted for awareness:

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | PROPOSAL | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-04-01-01 | OSR §10.3.8 originally presented two flooring options for DB to price. DEC-002 (Gate 2) directed DB to propose a single floor solution (no required base vs alternate). However, the OSR text remains in the document describing both options. | OSR §10.3.8 (two options) | DEC-002 / SOW-0303 (single solution) | REQ-04-01-013 (apron coordination); DEL-04-03 | DEC-002 governs: DB proposes one floor solution. OSR options are illustrative. Note this in DEL-04-03. | TBD |
