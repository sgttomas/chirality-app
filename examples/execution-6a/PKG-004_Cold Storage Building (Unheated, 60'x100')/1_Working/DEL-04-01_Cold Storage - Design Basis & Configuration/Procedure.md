## Steps

### Phase A: Proposal Stage (Pre-Award) — Produce the Design Basis Package

**Step A1 — Confirm Equipment Clearance Height Requirement**
Review the Public Works Critical Design Equipment List (Functional Program Appendix B) to identify the equipment types to be stored in the cold storage building (as opposed to the main building shop bays). Determine the maximum equipment height envelope. Establish a proposed minimum clear interior height with an appropriate headroom margin (ASSUMPTION: at least 2'--3' above tallest stored equipment). Document the height basis in a design note.

**TBD (External Input Required):** Prior to completing this step, confirm with the Owner which specific Public Works equipment types will be stored in the cold storage building. This is an external input that the Owner must provide. Until the equipment allocation is confirmed, the minimum clear height cannot be finalized and the structural framing design cannot proceed to completion. Record the confirmed equipment list and the resulting minimum clear height in the design note. (Ref: Lensing item A-004; source: Guidance.md C2; Specification.md REQ-04-01-003.)

**Step A2 — Select and Document the Structural Framing Concept**
Based on cost, code compliance, and 20-year design life, select a clear-span structural framing system (e.g., post-and-frame / pole shed, pre-engineered metal building, or equivalent). Prepare a framing concept narrative describing:
- Framing system type and clear-span dimensions
- Proposed structural grid and column/post spacing (if applicable)
- Materials (framing, roofing, cladding)
- Code basis (ABC; Penhold, AB snow, wind, and lateral load criteria)
- Design life basis (20 years)

**Step A3 — Prepare General Arrangement Drawing**
Produce a schematic plan view at appropriate scale showing:
- 60'×100' footprint
- Openings on two opposite sides (each with overhead door location and person door location)
- Proposed ventilation opening locations (ridge vent, gable vents, or other) for coordination with DEL-04-04
- Site orientation and relationship to proposed access routes
- Concrete apron extents at overhead door access points
- Coordination note referencing main building for door profile alignment

**Step A4 — Prepare Elevation and Section Drawings**
Produce schematic elevation and cross-section drawings showing:
- Building height and roof profile
- Overhead door and person door positions on elevations
- Interior clear span and height (section)
- Roof slope/drainage direction
- Framing system concept visible in section

**Step A5 — Prepare Coordination Notes**
Prepare a brief coordination note addressing:
- Overhead door window profile: confirm identical to main building (reference DEL-04-02 / PKG-002 door schedule)
- Person door keying: confirm same key as main building (keyed deadbolt)
- Aesthetic integration: describe how the cold storage building appearance relates to the main building
- Ventilation path: note how building configuration supports the ventilation approach (detail in DEL-04-04)
- Floor/apron interface: note that apron design coordinates with floor system proposed in DEL-04-03

**Step A6 — Internal Review and Coordination**
Circulate the draft design package internally to:
- PKG-002 team (confirm door profile / hardware key alignment)
- PKG-003 team (confirm site placement, drainage coordination, access routes)
- DEL-04-02, DEL-04-03, DEL-04-04 leads (confirm interface coordination)
Resolve any coordination conflicts before finalizing the proposal package.

**Step A7 — Confirm Design Submission Milestone Terminology**
Coordinate with the Owner to clarify which design submission milestones apply to the cold storage building specifically. Ensure consistency between RFP §7.1.8 milestone names (e.g., "Foundation IFC," "60% Detailed Design") and any project-specific revisions. Record the confirmed milestone list for use in Phase B. (Ref: Lensing item D-001; source: Procedure.md Step B5; Specification.md.)

**Step A8 — Assemble Proposal Design Package**
Compile the complete DEL-04-01 artifacts:
- General arrangement drawing(s)
- Elevation and section drawing(s)
- Framing concept narrative
- Coordination notes
Submit as part of the Design Brief in the proposal per RFP §7.1.2.

### Phase B: Design Development (Post-Award)

**Step B1 — Confirm Site Placement with Civil Team**
Upon award, receive survey files from the civil engineering firm (per Addendum 03 §1.20). Confirm cold storage building location coordinates with PKG-003 site plan. Finalize building placement, access route, and drainage integration.

**Step B2 — Complete Structural Design**
With registered structural engineer, complete the structural design for the cold storage building:
- Finalize structural system selection (confirm or refine framing type based on cost, lead time, geotechnical conditions)
- Perform structural calculations for snow, wind, and lateral loads per Alberta Building Code for Penhold, AB
- Prepare sealed structural drawings for permit submission

**Step B3 — Coordinate Envelope and Ventilation Design**
With DEL-04-04 lead, finalize ventilation/air circulation approach and confirm building configuration accommodates it (opening sizes, locations). Ensure weather-tight envelope details are incorporated into construction documents.

**Step B4 — Coordinate Floor and Apron Design**
With DEL-04-03 lead, confirm floor system selection and coordinate concrete apron details at overhead door access points. Finalize apron extent and thickness for service vehicle loads.

**Step B5 — Design Submission Review Milestones**
Submit design packages at Owner-required milestones per RFP §7.1.8:
- Building Design Development submission
- 60% Detailed Design review
- Foundation IFC (TBD -- confirm applicability to cold storage building; if the cold storage structural system does not require a separate foundation phase, this milestone may not apply)
- 100% Detailed Design
- 100% IFC full package

**Note on milestone terminology:** The milestone names listed above are derived from RFP §7.1.8 general requirements. The Specification does not separately reference these milestone names. DB shall confirm the applicable cold storage design submission milestones with the Owner during design development and ensure consistent terminology is used across all project documentation. (Ref: Lensing item D-001; source: Procedure.md Step B5; Specification.md.)

### Phase C: Construction

**Step C1 — Construction Documents Issuance**
Issue Issued for Construction (IFC) drawings for the cold storage building, including Alberta-registered professional seals.

**Step C2 — Permit Submission and AHJ Coordination**
Submit permit application including cold storage building drawings. Coordinate with AHJ regarding post-disaster importance category exemption (confirm in writing per REQ-04-01-007).

**Step C3 — Foundation and Framing Construction**
Construct foundation and structural framing in accordance with IFC drawings and geotechnical recommendations. Certify subgrade and granular base as required by geotechnical engineer.

**HOLD POINT C3-HP1 — Foundation/Subgrade Inspection:** Work shall stop after subgrade preparation and before framing erection. The geotechnical engineer (or designee) shall inspect and certify the subgrade/bearing surface. For embedded-post (pole shed) construction, post hole depths and bearing conditions shall be verified before post setting. For conventional foundations, footing bearing surfaces shall be inspected before concrete placement. This hold point shall not be released until the inspection is documented and accepted. (Ref: Lensing item C-002.)

**Step C4 — Envelope and Roof Construction**
Install roof and wall cladding per IFC drawings. Confirm weather-tight construction at all joints and penetrations.

**Step C5 — Door and Apron Installation**
Install overhead doors and person doors per DEL-04-02. Pour concrete aprons at overhead door access points per DEL-04-03 / DEL-04-02 interface.

**Step C6 — Ventilation System Installation**
Install ventilation/air circulation system per DEL-04-04. Confirm ventilation path is unobstructed.

**HOLD POINT C6-HP2 — Envelope Weather-Tightness and Ventilation Inspection:** Before closeout activities (Phase D), the building envelope shall be inspected to confirm weather-tight construction at all joints and penetrations (see Specification REQ-04-01-010 verification). The ventilation system installation shall be confirmed complete and unobstructed. This hold point shall not be released until both inspections are documented and accepted. (Ref: Lensing item C-002; source: Specification.md REQ-04-01-010, REQ-04-01-011.)
