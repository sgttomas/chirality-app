# Procedure: DEL-04-03 — Cold Storage Floor & Foundation (DB Proposed)

---

## Purpose

This procedure describes:
1. **Proposal production process** — the steps the Design-Builder takes to develop, document, and submit the floor and foundation proposal as part of the RFP response.
2. **Design and construction execution process** — the phases the Design-Builder follows to execute the proposed systems post-award.

Both phases are included because this deliverable type (a proposal-stage building design package with post-award execution obligations) benefits from end-to-end process visibility.

## Prerequisites

### For Proposal Production
- Access to the geotechnical investigation report (Union Street Geotechnical Ltd., File USG1123, February 2021) — provided as Appendix D of the RFP (OSR §10.3.2).

## Steps

### Phase A — Proposal Production (Pre-Award)

**Step A1 — Review Geotechnical Report**
Review Geotech Report File USG1123 for:
- Soil stratigraphy at building site (topsoil → sand → clay → till profile).
- Foundation type recommendations (§5.2 driven piles, §5.3 screw piles, §5.4 shallow footings).
- Frost design requirements (§5.5): frost depth 2.0 m; minimum pile embedment 5.3 m (driven) or upper helix below 2.0 m (screw); minimum footing depth 2.0 m (unheated).
- Floor slab recommendations (§7.1): subgrade preparation, granular base, vapour barrier, radon mitigation.
- Sulphate attack requirements (§4.3): Class S-2; Type HS cement; 32 MPa; w/c ≤0.45.
- Key risk: unheated on-grade construction with shallow foundations not recommended on frost-active clay subgrade (§5, item 2).

Note: If the DB identifies the report as insufficient for their proposed system, they must plan and budget for additional investigation (OSR §10.3.2).

**Step A2 — Structural Load Estimate**
In coordination with the structural lead (DEL-04-01), obtain a preliminary estimate of:
- Column/post loads at the foundation.
- Roof and snow loads.
- Wind uplift loads (relevant for pile tension/screw pile).
- Equipment loads expected in the building (storage of public works equipment per OSR §10.3.5).

Note: Geotech Report notes structural loads were "light to moderate" at time of original investigation (Geotech Report §2.2). The DB should confirm this characterization holds for the proposed configuration.

**Step A3 — Select and Justify Foundation System**
Based on Steps A1 and A2:
1. Evaluate foundation options against structural loads, geotechnical conditions, frost requirements, and cost:
   - Screw piles: generally favoured by geotech; confirm preliminary sizing using §5.3 equations and till properties (Su = 184 kPa, effective unit weight = 8.3 kN/m³).
   - Driven piles: confirm preliminary pile length ≥5.3 m; check cost vs. screw piles.
   - Shallow footings: confirm whether founding on sand at ≥0.61 m or till at ≥2.0 m is feasible within the building footprint; verify sufficient clearance from clay layer per §5.4.
   - Post-and-frame: confirm embedded post depth satisfies frost-jacking requirements consistent with §5.5.
2. Select one foundation system.
3. Prepare a brief written rationale: system selected, why it is the most cost-effective code-compliant option, and how geotech requirements are addressed.

Output: Foundation system selection with supporting rationale.

**Step A4 — Select and Justify Floor System**
1. Evaluate floor options:
   - Option 1 (Asphalt millings + concrete strips): assess suitability for equipment type, load distribution, frost tolerance.
   - Option 2 (Full concrete): assess lifecycle cost, subgrade preparation requirements per §7.1, concrete mix design implications (§4.3).
   - Other options: if proposing something other than OSR Options 1 or 2, document rationale for suitability.
2. Select one floor system.
3. Confirm apron scope: concrete aprons at both overhead doors (2) and both person doors (2) per OSR §10.3.10.

Output: Floor system selection with supporting rationale.

**Step A5 — Prepare Bearing/Settlement Assumptions**
Document the following for the proposal submission:
- Assumed bearing stratum (sand, till, or pile-supported; with reference to geotech report borehole data).
- Assumed bearing capacity values used (reference Geotech Report §5.2, §5.3, or §5.4 as applicable).
- Settlement tolerance assumed (SLS settlement: limit to <25 mm for shallow foundations per §5.4 items 6 and 8).
- Key assumptions: that the cold storage building footprint has consistent soil conditions with the report boreholes; that no significant variation from the described stratigraphy is encountered.

Label all inferences as ASSUMPTION until confirmed by geotechnical engineer of record during design.

**Step A6 — Prepare Proposal Documents**
Compile the following as the proposal-stage artifact:
- Foundation system proposal narrative (Step A3).
- Floor system proposal narrative (Step A4).
- Concept sketch or diagram showing: building footprint, foundation type/location, floor system, apron extents, bearing depths (schematic level acceptable for proposal stage).
- Bearing/settlement assumptions summary (Step A5).
- Concrete specification notes (if concrete is proposed: cement type, strength, w/c ratio, air entrainment).
- Geotechnical services plan: confirm DB will retain geotech during design/construction.

Ensure all proposal content is internally consistent with DEL-04-01 (structural configuration) and DEL-04-02 (door/opening locations).

**Step A7 — Internal Consistency Review**
Before finalizing the proposal:
- Confirm foundation type is consistent with structural framing concept in DEL-04-01.
- Confirm apron locations match door positions in DEL-04-02.
- Confirm floor surface level is consistent with door thresholds and overhead door clear height (16' minimum clear per SOW-0302).
- Confirm drainage slope away from building is achievable given site grading (coordinate with DEL-03-02).
- Confirm cross-deliverable consistency with DEL-04-04 (Cold Storage Electrical & Ventilation) regarding floor penetrations, conduit routing, or ventilation openings that could affect floor/foundation design. **[D-002]:** This check was added to prevent interface gaps with DEL-04-04.

### Phase B — Design Execution (Post-Award)

**Step B1 — Geotechnical Engineer Retention**
Retain a qualified geotechnical engineer to:
- Review the selected foundation system and confirm suitability based on the existing report.
- Determine whether additional geotechnical investigation is required for the specific cold storage footprint location.
- Provide foundation design parameters (pile capacity, footing bearing, etc.) for structural engineer use.
- Certify subgrade conditions during construction.

**Step B2 — Structural Design**
The structural engineer of record develops:
- Foundation drawings: pile schedule/screw pile layout, or footing dimensions and depths, reinforcing, concrete mix notes.
- Grade beam or cap beam details (as applicable to the selected foundation).
- Floor slab details (if concrete): thickness, reinforcing, joints, edge detailing, separation from structural elements per Geotech Report §7.1, items 10 and 11.
- Concrete apron details: load design basis, thickness, reinforcing, joint locations.
- Frost void detail (if pile-supported): minimum 100 mm (sand) or 150 mm (clay) between underside of structure and subgrade.

**Step B3 — Subgrade Preparation (Construction)**
Prior to floor slab placement:
1. Strip all topsoil, organics, and non-structural fill from the building footprint (Geotech Report §7.1, item 1).
2. Proof-roll exposed subgrade (per Geotech Report §5.1); observe and respond to soft/yielding areas. **[F-002]:** Proof roll acceptance criteria to be established by the geotechnical engineer of record. See Specification REQ-08 sub-req 7 for details.
3. Compact exposed subgrade to minimum 98% SPDD at OMC ±2% (ASTM D698) (Geotech Report §7.1, item 3). For fills exceeding 1.2 m: 100% SPDD.
4. Place structural fill in lifts ≤200 mm; test compaction frequency: one test per lift per 500 m² minimum (Geotech Report §5.1.1). **[A-004]:** Compaction testing frequency for subgrade (not just structural fill) is specified here; subgrade testing is covered under item 3 above.
5. Have geotechnical engineer certify exposed and prepared subgrade before granular base placement.

**Step B4 — Granular Base and Vapour Barrier Placement (if grade slab)**
1. Place minimum 150 mm of 20 mm screened/washed rock (Radon Rock; ≤10% passing 4 mm sieve) on prepared subgrade; compact with vibratory compactor (Geotech Report §7.1, item 6).
2. Install polyethylene vapour barrier (CAN/CGSB-51.34-M) over granular base, sealing all laps and penetrations (Geotech Report §7.1, item 7).
3. Place radon sump (if required): roughed-in sump near centre of footprint connected to minimum 100 mm diameter collection system (Geotech Report §7.1, item 5).

**Step B5 — Foundation Installation**
Screw piles:
- Install to confirmed depth with helical plate below 2.0 m frost depth.
- Match helix pitch to rate of advancement; avoid soil disturbance.
- Have screw pile designs reviewed by geotechnical engineer.
- Install in frozen soil if construction occurs in winter (acceptable per Geotech Report §5.3).

Driven steel pipe piles:
- Pre-bore if required (diameter ≤90% of pile OD; maximum pre-bore depth = 4.3 m; extend to 4.8 m if hard driving encountered) (Geotech Report §5.2.1).
- Drive to minimum 5.3 m total length.
- Inspect piles before driving (no protrusions, welds, or protruding driving shoes).
- Monitor with appropriate hammer energies: 25–35 kJ/blow for piles ≤200 mm dia; 45–65 kJ/blow for 250–300 mm dia (Geotech Report §5.2.2).
- Driving refusal criterion: 10 blows per 25.4 mm of penetration.
- Consider PDA testing to increase resistance factors (Geotech Report §5.2.3).

Shallow footings (if selected):
- Expose undisturbed native sand or till as founding stratum.
- Compact exposed founding surface before forming.
- Do not leave founding surface exposed to weather.
- Have geotechnical engineer inspect all shallow foundation bearing surfaces prior to casting (Geotech Report §5.4, item 10).
- If soft, wet, or frozen subgrade encountered: excavate further and backfill with concrete (Geotech Report §5.4, item 11).

**Step B6 — Concrete Placement**
- Confirm concrete mix design meets specification: Type HS cement (or Type 10 + 25% fly ash), f'c ≥32 MPa at 56 days, w/c ≤0.45, air-entrained, no calcium chloride admixtures.
- If placing in winter: comply with CAN/CSA-A23.1 cold weather provisions.
- Maintain separation between grade slab and grade beam or structural elements (no tying reinforcing between slab and structural edge elements).
- Saw-cut control joints in grade slab to manage crack locations. **[X-003]:** Control joint spacing and saw-cut timing shall be specified in the concrete placement plan or IFC drawings (ACI 302.1R or equivalent guidance); specific spacing and timing are TBD pending structural engineer specification.
- Cure concrete per specification. **[D-001]:** Curing method, duration, and compound type are TBD pending structural engineer specification; CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 standard curing requirements apply.

**Step B7 — Drainage and Grading**
- Confirm finished grade around building slopes minimum 3% (first 3.0 m from building) away from foundations.
- Ensure downspouts discharge away from building.
- Ensure no landscaping or fill is placed against building that could pond water adjacent to foundations.
