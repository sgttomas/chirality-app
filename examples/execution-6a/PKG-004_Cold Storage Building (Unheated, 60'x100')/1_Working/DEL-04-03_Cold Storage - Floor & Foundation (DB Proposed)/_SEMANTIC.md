# Deliverable: DEL-04-03 Cold Storage -- Floor & Foundation (DB Proposed)

**Generated:** 2026-02-17
**Perspective:** This deliverable carries the knowledge required to justify and describe a unified floor-and-foundation system for an unheated storage building on frost-active ground, reconciling geotechnical constraints with cost-effectiveness. It must make the Design-Builder's structural strategy visible to evaluators by demonstrating that the proposed system addresses bearing capacity, frost resistance, subgrade preparation, and material durability as a coherent, defensible whole.
