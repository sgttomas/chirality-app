# Guidance: DEL-04-03 — Cold Storage Floor & Foundation (DB Proposed)

---

## Purpose

This deliverable exists to allow the Design-Builder to propose a practical, cost-effective floor and foundation system for the 60'×100' unheated cold storage building in the Town of Penhold Public Services Building project.

The Owner has explicitly declined to prescribe a foundation type, instead directing the Design-Builder to propose the most cost-effective code-compliant solution (DEC-003; OSR §10.3.6). Similarly, the DB proposes a single floor solution (DEC-002; SOW-0303). This deliverable is the vehicle through which the DB's geotechnical and structural strategy is made visible to the evaluator.

The deliverable supports **OBJ-004**: deliver the unheated cold storage building with practical access, moisture management, and door configuration compatible with the main building. The floor and foundation directly determine the operational durability and lifecycle cost of the ancillary building.

## Principles

### Principle 1 — The Geotech Report Governs
The Union Street Geotechnical Ltd. report (File USG1123, February 2021) is the primary technical basis for foundation and floor decisions at this site. Its key findings are:
- Subgrade is frost-active and high-plasticity. Unheated, on-grade structures with shallow foundations where movement would be detrimental are NOT recommended.
- Clay (CH, high plasticity) begins at approximately 1.35 m below grade and is NOT suitable as a bearing stratum for shallow foundations.
- Frost penetration depth is 2.0 m.
- Three viable foundation systems are identified: driven steel pipe piles, screw piles, and shallow footings on sand or till (at or below 2.0 m depth).
- The concrete sulphate environment is severe (Class S-2).

Source: Geotech Report §4.1, §4.3, §5, §5.5.

### Principle 2 — Unheated Status Drives Design
An unheated building experiences full frost penetration to 2.0 m depth. This eliminates or complicates many shallow foundation options that would be acceptable in a heated building. The geotech explicitly flags this risk for on-grade construction. Any proposed floor system must account for potential frost heave in the subgrade — either by using a structurally supported floor independent of the grade, or by accepting the risks of a grade-supported slab and mitigating through proper subgrade preparation per Geotech Report §7.1.

Source: Geotech Report §5.5; §5, item 2.

### Principle 3 — One Foundation Type Per Structure
The geotech recommends against mixing foundation types under the same structure. Different foundation systems mobilize resistance at different load levels and depths; mixing them creates differential settlement and rotation risk. The DB's proposal should commit to a single, uniform system across the building footprint.

Source: Geotech Report §5, item 5.

### Principle 4 — Owner Values Cost-Effectiveness
OSR §10.3.6 states the cold storage building has "no foundation preference assuming that the most-cost effective solution would be pursued (i.e. post and frame construction (pole shed))." The evaluator is therefore likely to score proposals favourably that present a pragmatic, cost-justified selection backed by geotechnical evidence — not the most elaborate system.

Source: OSR §10.3.6.

### Principle 5 — Positive Drainage is Non-Negotiable
The geotech strongly recommends positive drainage away from all structures, particularly for grade-supported foundations and slabs. Landscaped areas against buildings and downspouts discharging near foundations are specifically warned against. This is a design execution discipline, not a stylistic choice.

## Considerations

### Foundation Option Assessment

**Screw Piles:**
- Described in the geotech report as "ideal" for this site (Geotech Report §5.3).
- Advantage: The helical plate resists frost-jacking without the full 5.3 m embedment required for driven piles — the helix only needs to be below the 2.0 m frost depth.
- Advantage: Can be installed in frozen soil; can theoretically be removed in the future.
- Suitable for light-to-moderate loads consistent with an ancillary storage building.
- Design: Retain a qualified geotechnical engineer to review anchor designs.

**Driven Steel Pipe Piles:**
- Also a viable option; requires minimum preliminary embedment of 5.3 m to resist frost jacking.
- Open-end piles recommended for till-terminating piles.
- More engineering effort and cost than screw piles for a light structure.
- Pile Driving Analysis (PDA) testing may increase allowable capacity and reduce steel costs.

**Shallow Footings (on sand or till):**
- Viable if founded on undisturbed native sand (min 0.61 m depth; typically at ~1.35 m below grade) or native till (min 2.0 m depth).
- For an unheated building, the geotech requires minimum 2.0 m founding depth to escape frost action.
- Clay (CH) is NOT suitable as a bearing stratum; must maintain 0.50 m buffer between footing base and top of clay when founding on sand.
- ULS bearing capacity: 300 kPa (sand strip footing, >0.61 m depth); 360 kPa (till strip footing, >2.0 m depth).
- SLS allowable: 100 kPa (sand); 120 kPa (till) — settlement limited to 25 mm.
- Excavation to 2.0 m may encounter groundwater (depth ~3.0–4.0 m, but seasonal variation possible).

**Post-and-Frame / Pole Shed Construction:**
- Owner's cited cost-effective example (OSR §10.3.6).
- Typically uses embedded wood or steel posts as the primary structural element; posts bear on concrete embedment or helical anchors.
- Post embedment for frost jacking resistance must still comply with geotech requirements.
- ASSUMPTION: This is a commonly used ancillary building construction approach in Alberta; actual structural compliance with ABC must be confirmed during design.
- **Code compliance pathway [B-005]:** Post-and-frame / pole shed construction is the Owner's cited example, but its ABC compliance basis is marked as an ASSUMPTION throughout these documents. The DB should clarify during design whether: (a) the ABC edition governing this project (TBD per Specification [A-003]) explicitly addresses post-and-frame construction for agricultural/storage buildings; (b) the structural engineer can design post embedments and connections to meet the applicable code's structural provisions (loads, connections, bracing); and (c) the embedded posts can be demonstrated to resist frost jacking per the geotech requirements (2.0 m minimum depth for unheated structures). If the ABC compliance pathway for post-and-frame is unclear, the DB should document the engineering basis in the proposal narrative and confirm with the structural engineer of record. Post-and-frame may offer the lowest-cost path while still meeting geotech frost design requirements, provided embedded post depths are defensible.

### Design Life Implications for Foundation and Floor Selection [A-005]

The design life of the ancillary cold storage building is TBD (Datasheet [A-001]). The main building has a stated 50-year design life (OSR §10.2), but no accessible source confirms whether the ancillary building shares this target or has a shorter design life.

Design life directly affects:
- **Foundation durability:** A 50-year design life on frost-active, sulphate-aggressive soils demands robust corrosion protection (e.g., galvanized or epoxy-coated screw piles) and conservative frost design. A shorter design life (e.g., 25 years) may justify less conservative -- and less costly -- material selections.
- **Floor system selection:** Full concrete with sulphate-resistant mix (REQ-07) provides long-term durability but at higher initial cost. Asphalt millings are more easily replaced but may require periodic re-capping over a 50-year lifespan.
- **Lifecycle cost assessment:** Without a confirmed design life, the DB cannot perform a meaningful lifecycle cost comparison (see [F-003] below). The evaluator's assessment of cost-effectiveness (Principle 4) implicitly depends on the assumed service period.

**ASSUMPTION (best-effort):** The ancillary building is likely intended to have a design life comparable to the main building (50 years) given that both are part of the same Public Services Building complex, but this must be confirmed by the Owner.

### Floor Option Assessment

**Option 1 — Compacted Asphalt Millings + Concrete Strips (OSR §10.3.8):**
- Lower cost; appropriate for equipment storage where heavy vehicles operate on grade.
- Asphalt millings provide a durable, self-healing surface that can accommodate minor frost heave movement without cracking.
- Concrete strips (4'/1,219 mm wide) provide a stable base for pallet racking legs, which would concentrate loads unsuitable for asphalt millings alone.
- Does not require complex subgrade preparation to the same degree as a concrete slab; asphalt millings can tolerate minor differential movement.
- Suitable if the primary operational use is vehicle/equipment storage rather than precision pallet operations.
- Concrete aprons at all door openings are still required (OSR §10.3.10) regardless of floor choice.

**Option 2 — Full Concrete Floor (OSR §10.3.8):**
- Higher cost; superior durability and load capacity for heavy equipment and pallet racking.
- Subject to frost heave risk if the subgrade is not properly prepared per Geotech Report §7.1.
- Requires full sulphate-resistant concrete mix design (32 MPa, Type HS cement, w/c ≤0.45).
- Radon mitigation system (sump + granular base + vapour barrier) recommended by geotech even for ancillary buildings.
- Grade beam / slab edge detailing requires care — do not tie grade slab to structural elements.
- ASSUMPTION: A full concrete slab would likely be the higher-quality but higher-cost option; evaluator comparison will depend on overall proposal pricing.

### Drainage Integration
The floor surface and surrounding grade must drain positively away from the building. With an unheated building and frost-active soils, water pooling at the base of foundations or slab edges is a leading cause of heave and settlement damage. Minimum finished grade slope of 3% over the first 3.0 m from the building is recommended.

Source: Geotech Report §5.1.2; §5.5.3.

### Sulphate Exposure
Soil testing for sulphate content was not performed prior to the 2021 geotech report due to schedule constraints. The geotech conservatively assigned severe sulphate exposure (Class S-2) and required Type HS cement. This applies to all concrete in contact with native or cohesive fill soil — footings, grade beams, slab, and aprons.

Source: Geotech Report §4.3.

### Seismic Classification
The site is Seismic Site Class "C" (Vs between 360–760 m/s). Structural design must incorporate appropriate seismic loads per the applicable building code.

## Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Description | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Screw piles vs. shallow footings | Screw piles have better frost-jacking resistance for unheated buildings and do not require deep open excavation; shallow footings at 2.0 m depth may encounter difficult excavation conditions and require careful clay avoidance. For a light storage structure, screw piles are generally more reliable in this soil profile. | Prefer screw piles unless the structural engineer can demonstrate shallow footings at 2.0 m on sand/till with sufficient safety margin. |
| Asphalt millings floor vs. full concrete | Asphalt millings are lower cost and more tolerant of frost heave movement; full concrete offers better long-term durability and load capacity. For equipment storage with potential forklift or heavy vehicle use, full concrete provides a better operational surface at higher initial cost. | DB should clearly justify the selection based on operational requirements and lifecycle cost. Evaluator is looking for a reasoned, cost-aware choice — not necessarily the premium option. |
| Grade slab vs. structurally supported floor | A grade slab is lower cost but subject to frost heave risk in the frost-active, high-plasticity subgrade. A structurally supported floor (spanning between piles) eliminates heave risk but significantly increases cost for an ancillary building of this span. | For a storage building where minor differential movement is tolerable, a well-prepared grade slab with proper subgrade treatment per §7.1 is a reasonable choice. If the foundation uses deep piles, the DB may still elect a grade slab for the floor. |
| Cost-effectiveness vs. geotechnical conservatism | The Owner values cost-effectiveness; the geotech warns strongly against unheated on-grade construction on this soil profile. | The DB must find the defensible middle ground: comply with geotech requirements for frost design while keeping the system simple. Screw piles + asphalt millings, or screw piles + concrete slab, are both defensible combinations. Ignoring the geotech frost warnings would be a proposal risk. |
| Design life implications [A-005] | A 50-year design life (assumed for the main building) demands robust, durable materials and conservative frost design. A shorter design life (e.g., 25 years) may justify simpler, lower-cost solutions with planned replacement. Without confirmation of the ancillary building's design life, the DB cannot perform a meaningful lifecycle cost analysis. | Lifecycle cost and material selection (e.g., galvanized vs. painted piles; Type HS concrete vs. standard mix) should be justified relative to the design life assumption. The DB should confirm design life with the Owner early in design. |

### Proposal Evaluation Criteria [C-003, D-003]

Principle 4 states the evaluator is "likely to score proposals favourably" for pragmatic, cost-justified selections. However, no accessible source provides the actual RFP evaluation scoring criteria or weighting for the foundation/floor proposal component.

**TBD_QUESTION [D-003]:** What are the RFP evaluation scoring criteria and weights for the cold storage foundation/floor proposal? The DB needs this information to optimize proposal merit. If an RFP evaluation matrix or scoring guide exists, it should be referenced here.

**In the absence of stated criteria**, the DB should consider the following as directional guidance (ASSUMPTION -- inferred from OSR language and DEC-003):
- **Geotechnical compliance:** Demonstrating full compliance with the geotech report recommendations is likely a threshold requirement, not a scored element.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** The OSR explicitly values cost-effective solutions (OSR §10.3.6). Proposals that present clear cost reasoning backed by geotechnical evidence are likely to score well.
- **Completeness of proposal:** A proposal that addresses foundation, floor, aprons, drainage, and concrete specification in a coherent narrative likely demonstrates stronger competence.
- **Risk awareness:** Proposals that acknowledge and address the geotech frost warning (§5, item 2) and CONF-001 tension demonstrate good professional judgment.

### Lifecycle Cost Comparison Framework [F-003]

The Trade-offs section above discusses cost qualitatively ("lower cost," "higher cost") but no structured comparison framework is provided. Principle 4 (Owner values cost-effectiveness) requires that the DB be able to articulate a defensible cost argument. The following framework is provided as a scaffold for lifecycle cost comparison (ASSUMPTION -- values must be populated by the DB based on their pricing and experience):

| Cost Factor | Option A: Screw Piles + Concrete Slab | Option B: Post-and-Frame + Asphalt Millings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Initial capital cost** | TBD | TBD | Foundation + floor + aprons + subgrade prep |
| **Geotechnical services** | TBD | TBD | Design review, construction certification |
| **Engineering design fees** | TBD | TBD | Structural, civil, geotechnical |
| **Maintenance (per decade)** | TBD | TBD | Concrete: joint sealant, crack repair; Millings: re-capping, grading |
| **Expected service life** | TBD (depends on design life confirmation per [A-005]) | TBD | Concrete: 40-50+ years with proper mix; Millings: 10-20 years before re-capping (ASSUMPTION) |
| **Replacement/rehabilitation cost** | TBD | TBD | At end of service life or major repair |
| **Total lifecycle cost (NPV)** | TBD | TBD | Discount rate and analysis period TBD |

**Notes:**
- This table is a scaffold only; the DB populates it based on their cost estimates.
- The analysis period depends on the confirmed design life of the ancillary building (TBD per [A-005]).
- Additional option combinations (e.g., screw piles + asphalt millings) should be evaluated if the DB considers them competitive.

## Examples

### Plausible Combination A (ASSUMPTION — example only; not a design recommendation)
Foundation: Screw piles (helical plate below 2.0 m frost depth) with concrete grade beams; minimum 100 mm void under structural elements above frost-active soil.
Floor: Grade-supported concrete slab per Geotech Report §7.1 (strip topsoil, compact subgrade, 150 mm radon rock, vapour barrier, concrete slab); isolated from grade beams with separation boards.
Aprons: Concrete aprons at 2 overhead doors + 2 person doors.

ASSUMPTION: This combination satisfies the geotech requirements and is consistent with the Owner's cost-effective preference while maintaining durability.

### Plausible Combination B (ASSUMPTION — example only; not a design recommendation)
Foundation: Post-and-frame / pole shed construction (structural posts embedded or on concrete pad footings below 2.0 m, on native sand or till).
Floor: Compacted asphalt millings (full building footprint) + 4' (1,219 mm) concrete strips at pallet racking locations.
Aprons: Concrete aprons at 2 overhead doors + 2 person doors.

ASSUMPTION: This is the Owner's cited example system. It is lowest cost. The DB must confirm that embedded post footings resist frost jacking and bear appropriately per geotech requirements.

## Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted Sections | Proposed Authority | Human Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-001 | Geotech warns unheated on-grade/shallow-foundation construction is NOT recommended on this frost-active soil; Owner cites pole shed (which is typically shallow-founded) as the cost-effective example. These appear in tension. | Geotech Report §5, item 2 | OSR §10.3.6 | Specification REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-03; Guidance Trade-offs; Guidance Foundation Option Assessment (Post-and-Frame) | PROPOSAL: Interpret OSR as a cost-preference signal, not a technical override. DB must still comply with geotech requirements. Pole shed with adequate frost-resistant footings or embedded posts is valid; the DB should document the frost-jacking resistance basis in the proposal. | TBD |
| CONF-002 | OSR §10.3.8 presents two specific floor options for the cold storage building (asphalt millings OR full concrete). DEC-002 says DB proposes one solution. It is unclear whether the DB must choose from the OSR options or may propose a different system. | OSR §10.3.8 | DEC-002 / SOW-0303 | Specification REQ-05; Guidance Examples | PROPOSAL: The two OSR options are offered as guidance examples, not an exhaustive list. DEC-002 grants the DB freedom to propose an appropriate solution. DB should note if proposing something other than the OSR options and explain suitability for cold storage operations. | TBD |
