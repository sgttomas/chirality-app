## Requirements

### REQ-01 — Foundation System Selection
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall propose the most cost-effective, code-compliant foundation system for the unheated cold storage building.
**Source:** SOW-0304; DEC-003; OSR §10.3.6.
**Constraint:** Foundation type must comply with the Alberta Building Code (location TBD) and must be informed by the geotechnical investigation (Geotech Report File USG1123).
**Note:** OSR §10.3.6 states no owner foundation preference; post-and-frame/pole shed construction is cited as an acceptable example.

### REQ-01A — Seismic Design Loads [A-002]
**Statement:** The foundation system shall be designed for seismic loads appropriate for Seismic Site Class C (average shear wave velocity 360 < Vs < 760 m/s).
**Source:** Geotech Report §6; Guidance: Seismic Classification.
**Constraint:** Structural design must incorporate seismic loads per the applicable building code (ABC / NBC as adopted by Alberta -- edition TBD per [A-003]).
**ASSUMPTION:** Seismic design is required for this structure under the applicable building code. The specific seismic design parameters (importance category, force modification factors, etc.) are TBD pending structural engineer determination.

### REQ-02 — Foundation Frost Design
**Statement:** The foundation system shall be designed to resist frost jacking appropriate for an unheated structure in the Penhold region, where estimated frost penetration depth is 2.0 m.
**Source:** Geotech Report §5.5.1, §5.5.2.
**Constraint:**
- If driven pipe piles are used: minimum preliminary pile embedment length of 5.3 m (Geotech Report §5.5.2).
- If screw piles are used: upper helical plate must be installed below the 2.0 m frost depth (Geotech Report §5.3).
- If shallow footings are used: minimum founding depth of 2.0 m below finished grade for unheated structure (Geotech Report §5.4, item 2).

### REQ-03 — Foundation Bearing Stratum
**Statement:** The selected foundation shall bear on or derive resistance from native sand or till; the high-plasticity clay stratum (CH; present from ~1.35 m below grade) shall NOT be used as a shallow bearing stratum.
**Source:** Geotech Report §5, items 2 and 3; §5.4.
**ASSUMPTION:** The cold storage building footprint is on the same site as the boreholes described in the geotechnical report (BH101--BH116). DB must confirm geotechnical conditions at the specific cold storage footprint location during design; additional investigation may be required (OSR §10.3.2).
**Clarification [B-002]:** Existing borehole data (BH101--BH116) covers the main site but may not directly underlie the cold storage footprint. The DB shall evaluate whether the existing borehole spacing and locations provide sufficient coverage for the cold storage building. If the cold storage footprint is outside the area bounded by existing boreholes, or if the DB's proposed foundation system requires site-specific data not captured in the existing investigation, additional geotechnical investigation shall be undertaken and paid for by the DB (OSR §10.3.2).

### REQ-04 — Single Foundation System
**Statement:** Only one type of foundation system shall be used to support the cold storage building structure.
**Source:** Geotech Report §5, item 5.
**Rationale:** Different foundation types mobilize support differently; mixing types under the same structure creates differential settlement risk.

### REQ-05 — Floor System Selection
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall propose a single floor solution appropriate for cold storage operations. Alternates may be provided optionally but are not required.
**Source:** SOW-0303; DEC-002; OSR §10.3.8.
**Context:** OSR §10.3.8 identifies two floor options for the evaluator's reference:
- Option 1: Compacted asphalt millings + 4' (1,219 mm) wide concrete strips for pallet racking.
- Option 2: Full concrete floor + concrete aprons at overhead and person doors.
The DB shall propose one solution; the proposal does not need to match an OSR option exactly, but must be appropriate for cold storage operations.

### REQ-06 — Concrete Aprons
**Statement:** Concrete aprons shall be provided at all overhead door and person door access points, designed for the expected service vehicle loads.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.10.
**Note:** The cold storage building has two (2) overhead doors (16'×16') and two (2) person doors (SOW-0302).

### REQ-07 — Concrete Mix Design (where concrete is used)
**Statement:** All concrete placed in contact with native or cohesive fill soils shall be designed for severe sulphate exposure (Class S-2).
**Source:** Geotech Report §4.3.
**Sub-requirements:**
- Cement type: Sulphate-Resistant Portland Cement Type HS, OR Type 10 cement + approximately 25% (by mass) Type F or CI fly ash.
- Minimum specified 56-day compressive strength: 32 MPa (CAN/CSA A23.1-2014, Table 3).
- Maximum water-cement ratio: 0.45 (CAN/CSA A23.1-2014, Table 3).
- Air entrainment: Required per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 §4.3.3 and Table 4 (concrete exposed to freezing and thawing). **[E-001]:** Target air content percentage is TBD -- the value depends on aggregate nominal maximum size and exposure class per CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 Table 4 (standard not directly accessed). DB structural engineer to confirm the specific target air content range in the mix design submittal.
- Calcium chloride or chloride-containing admixtures: NOT permitted.
- Winter placement: Must comply with CAN/CSA-A23.1 cold weather provisions.
- Curing: Concrete shall be cured in accordance with CAN/CSA A23.1-2014 requirements for the applicable exposure class. **[D-001]:** Procedure Step B6 references "cure concrete per specification" -- this sub-requirement provides the normative basis. Minimum curing duration, method, and compound type are TBD pending structural engineer specification (ASSUMPTION: standard moist curing or curing compound per CAN/CSA A23.1 is expected).

### REQ-07A — Minimum Concrete Slab Thickness [F-001]
**Statement:** If a grade-supported concrete slab or concrete apron is proposed, the Design-Builder's structural engineer shall specify the minimum slab thickness.
**Source:** Geotech Report §7.1 (subgrade preparation addressed but slab thickness not stated); REQ-07 and REQ-08 (concrete mix and subgrade requirements addressed but no minimum slab thickness requirement stated).
**Context:** No accessible source specifies a minimum slab thickness for the cold storage building floor or aprons. This is a codified compliance benchmark that must be established by the DB structural engineer based on applied loads (floor live loads TBD per Datasheet [B-001]), soil support conditions, and the applicable building code.
**ASSUMPTION:** Minimum slab thickness is delegated to the DB structural engineer, who shall document the basis for the selected thickness in the proposal and/or IFC drawings.

### REQ-08 — Grade-Supported Slab Subgrade Preparation (if grade slab is proposed)
**Statement:** If a grade-supported slab is included in the proposed floor system, the following subgrade preparation requirements shall apply.
**Source:** Geotech Report §7.1.
**Sub-requirements:**
1. Strip topsoil, organics, and non-structural fill below the proposed slab extent.
2. Scarify and compact exposed subgrade to minimum 98% SPDD (100% for fills exceeding 1.2 m); water content within ±2% of OMC (ASTM D698).
3. Any fill material used to raise grade shall be non-expansive low-to-medium plastic soil; placed in lifts not exceeding 200 mm.
4. Place minimum 150 mm of 20 mm screened/washed rock (Radon Rock; ≤10% passing 4 mm sieve) on the prepared subgrade.
5. Install polyethylene vapour barrier (CAN/CGSB-51.34-M) between granular base and concrete slab. **[E-002]:** Minimum vapour barrier thickness, lap width, and sealing method are TBD -- CAN/CGSB-51.34-M is referenced but not directly accessed. DB to specify minimum thickness (ASSUMPTION: 6 mil / 0.15 mm minimum is common practice), minimum lap width, and sealing requirements in the construction specification.
6. Provide site drainage away from slab; minimum 2% slope.
7. **Proof Roll Acceptance [F-002]:** Proof rolling of the exposed subgrade shall be performed prior to granular base placement. Acceptance criteria: TBD -- the geotechnical report (§5.1) requires proof rolling but does not specify quantitative pass/fail criteria. The geotechnical engineer of record shall establish proof roll acceptance criteria (e.g., maximum rut depth, deflection limit) appropriate for the proposed floor system. Areas exhibiting soft, yielding, or pumping conditions shall be remediated to the geotechnical engineer's satisfaction before proceeding.

### REQ-09 — Grade Slab Independence (if grade slab is proposed)
**Statement:** Reinforcing steel shall not connect the grade-supported slab to the edge of the grade beam or other structurally supported elements. Separation boards shall be provided between the grade slab and adjacent structurally supported structures.
**Source:** Geotech Report §7.1, items 10 and 11.
**Rationale:** Prevents load transfer from the potentially heaving grade slab to stable structural elements.

### REQ-10 — Void Space Under Pile-Supported Structures (if pile foundation is proposed)
**Statement:** A minimum void space shall be maintained between the underside of pile-supported structure and the subgrade surface to accommodate frost heave without structural damage.
**Source:** Geotech Report §5.5.3.
**Minimum void:** 100 mm (sand subgrade); 150 mm (clay subgrade).

### REQ-10A — Settlement Tolerance for Pile Foundations [C-001]
**Statement:** If a pile-supported foundation is proposed, the Design-Builder shall state the settlement tolerance criterion for the pile foundation system.
**Source:** Geotech Report §5.2, §5.3 (pile capacity parameters provided but no settlement limit stated for piles).
**Context:** For shallow footings, settlement is limited to 25 mm SLS (Procedure Step A5; Geotech Report §5.4, items 6 and 8). No equivalent criterion is stated for pile foundations, creating an asymmetric enforceable basis depending on foundation type. The DB structural engineer shall establish the pile settlement tolerance, referencing the Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual (4th Edition, 2006) and the geotechnical engineer's input.
**ASSUMPTION:** A settlement tolerance criterion for pile foundations is necessary for design verification and is TBD pending structural/geotechnical engineer input.

### REQ-11 — Geotechnical Services
**Statement:** The Design-Builder shall retain qualified geotechnical services to certify the imported fill material, certify the exposed and prepared subgrade, and certify the prepared granular base below the building.
**Source:** OSR §10.3.6.
**Note:** If the DB finds the existing geotechnical report (Geotech Report File USG1123, 2021) insufficient, the DB is required to undertake and pay for additional investigation (OSR §10.3.2).

### REQ-12 — Positive Drainage
**Statement:** Positive drainage shall be maintained around the cold storage building foundations and floor to avoid ponding adjacent to grade-supported slabs, foundations, and roadways.
**Source:** Geotech Report §5 (intro); §7.1, item 9.
**Minimum grade:** 3% over first 3.0 m from building (Geotech Report §5.1.2).
**Normalization note [E-003]:** This 3% slope requirement (Geotech Report §5.1.2) applies to foundation perimeter drainage -- the finished grade around the building. A separate 2% minimum slope requirement applies to slab surface drainage (Geotech Report §7.1, item 9; see REQ-08 sub-req 6). These are distinct contexts: perimeter grading vs. floor surface drainage. Both requirements apply in their respective scopes.

### REQ-12A — Radon Mitigation [B-003]
**Statement:** If a grade-supported slab is proposed, the Design-Builder shall include provisions for radon mitigation in the floor system design, or shall provide an explicit written rationale for exclusion.
**Source:** Geotech Report §7.1, item 5 (recommends roughed-in radon sump and minimum 100 mm diameter collection system even for ancillary buildings).
**Context:** Guidance and Procedure both reference radon mitigation (sump + collection system per Geotech Report §7.1, item 5), but no prior requirement in this Specification addressed radon. This requirement closes that gap. If the DB determines radon mitigation is not required for an unheated, ventilated ancillary building, a documented justification shall be provided.
**ASSUMPTION:** Radon mitigation applicability for unheated buildings may differ from heated buildings under the ABC; actual requirement to be confirmed against the governing code edition (TBD per [A-003]).

### REQ-13 — Sealed Documents
**Statement:** All structural and civil design documents shall be sealed by Alberta-registered professional engineers.
**Source:** RFP §7.1.2.
