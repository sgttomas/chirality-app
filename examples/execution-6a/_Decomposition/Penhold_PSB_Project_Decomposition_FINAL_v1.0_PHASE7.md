## Phase 6 — Verify Coverage (anti-fragile checks)

### Verification checks performed (results)

- **ScopeItem → Package assignment:** every `SOW-####` is assigned to **exactly one** `PKG-###` (required) — **PASS**.
- **Deliverable → Package assignment:** every `DEL-##-##_*` belongs to **exactly one** `PKG-###` (required) — **PASS**.
- **ScopeItem → Deliverable mapping:** every **IN-scope** `SOW-####` maps to **≥ 1** deliverable (best-effort) — **PASS** (0 unmapped in-scope items).
- **Objective support mapping:** every `OBJ-###` is supported by **≥ 1** deliverable (best-effort) — **PASS** (0 unsupported objectives).

### Coverage & Telemetry (Phase 6 — verification)

- **Revision:** v1.0 (Phase 7) — 2026-02-17
- **ScopeItemCount:** 78 (**IN:** 77; **OUT:** 1)
- **PackageCount:** 6
- **DeliverableCount:** 31
- **ObjectiveCount:** 10
- **UnassignedScopeItems:** 0 (hard requirement; must remain 0)
- **ScopeItemsWithoutDeliverableMapping:** 0 (best-effort; target is 0)
- **DeliverablesWithMultiplePackages:** 0 (hard requirement; must remain 0)
- **ObjectivesWithoutDeliverableSupport:** 0 (best-effort; target is 0)
- **OUT (excluded) scope items tracked:** 1 (`SOW-0400`)
- **Optional priced items:** 6 (`SOW-0500`–`SOW-0505`)
- **Cash allowance items:** 2 (`SOW-0110` service tie-ins; `SOW-0506` FF&E **$20k**)
- **OpenIssuesCount:** 4

### Open Issues (carry-forward; informational)

- **SOW-0110** — DB still responsible for design coordination and execution once conditions are confirmed (cash allowance is for tie-in costs; DB still coordinates/integrates).
- **SOW-0114** — Constraint; confirm exact floodway/fringe limits during design.
- **SOW-0218** — Verify any special acoustic/cleanability expectations during design.
- **SOW-0222** — Confirm runtime requirements (functional program notes 72 hours).

## Phase 7 — Publish the Decomposition (final)

### What changed since v0.5 (Phase 6)
- **Gate 6 status updated** to **CONFIRMED (approved)** based on your acceptance.
- Added the **Decision Log** and **Revision History** sections required for Phase 7 publication.
- **No scope items, packages, deliverables, or objectives were added/removed**, and **all IDs remain stable**.

### Gate 7 — Final acceptance (required to start downstream agents)

Please confirm:

> **Gate 7 approved** — this decomposition is the accepted basis for downstream work.

If you want any changes before final acceptance, please specify them as one of:
- **Fix a mapping:** `SOW-####` from `DEL-...` → `DEL-...`
- **Add a missing deliverable:** `PKG-###` + deliverable name and boundary
- **Split/merge deliverables (within a package):** describe new boundaries and affected `SOW-####`
- **Change a scope boundary:** specify `SOW-####` as `IN|OUT|TBD` and explain why
