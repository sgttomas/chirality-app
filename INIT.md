# INIT — Next Session Orientation

This document is meant to get the following 4_DOCUMENTS agent off to the races without retracing earlier work.
The user will have directed you to read this file and which package you will be working on after your orientation is complete.

## Immediate tasks
1. Read `/Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/chirality-app/agents/AGENT_4_DOCUMENTS.md`.  
2. **Focus scope:** Begin your work inside `test/execution/PKG-*/1_Working/`. Each deliverable folder you touch should only have `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, and the decomposition entry read to understand its scope. **Skip scanning deliverables outside the PKG-* you are working on ** unless explicitly directed.
3. **Produce documents:** Run the 4_DOCUMENTS enrichment cycle (three passes) for each PKG-* deliverable in order.  Start with the DEL.*.01* and proceed in sequence revising all 4 Documents one deliverable at a time. Overwrite the four documents, label assumptions/TBDs, cite the decomposition or Employer's Requirements PDFs, and keep cross-document consistency in mind.
4. **Don’t invent states:** `_STATUS.md` files already reflect the correct lifecycle state. Do not change them unless the deliverable is still `OPEN` and you’re generating the initial drafts for the first time.

## Orientation rules for the next agent
- **No re-reading past deliverables:**  Do not try to audit other package  content again.
- **Keep relationships local:** You only need to think about how your assigned PKG-* deliverable ties to the decomposition’s scope, objectives, and referenced documents. Adjacent deliverables only matter where the current `_CONTEXT.md` explicitly references them.
- **Focus on design intent:** The decomposition and `_CONTEXT.md` provide the project context you need for this deliverable. Build your four documents from that info.

## Lessons for the next iteration
- The cross-document alignment pass performed in PKG-03 (Datasheet ↔ Specification ↔ Guidance ↔ Procedure) is repeatable; keep capturing those explicit link points so future agents can trust the status and move forward without rechecking everything.
- Document references and verification points directly in each file so the next working batch can be confident the draft reflects what came before.
