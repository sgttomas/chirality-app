# What Was Left Unsaid

While the core principles of professional engineering and AI integration are clear, several important themes remain underemphasized or unexplored:

## The Role of Public Perception and Trust

- How does the public perceive AI-driven engineering?
- What steps are needed to build and maintain public trust in these systems?

## Balancing Innovation and Conservatism

- How can the field balance the need for innovation with the conservatism required in high-stakes environments?
- What are the risks of moving too slowly or too quickly?

## Practical Implementation Challenges

- What are the real-world challenges of implementing these principles in diverse regulatory environments?
- How can organizations ensure consistency in AI-driven engineering practices across different jurisdictions?

## The Human Factor

- How do we address the human factors in AI-driven engineering: training, adaptation, and resistance to change?
- What support systems are needed for professionals transitioning to AI-augmented workflows?

## Long-Term Impact

- What are the long-term implications of AI in professional engineering for the profession itself?
- How will the role of the engineer evolve as AI becomes more integrated into practice?
