## Chirality AI Position Statement on Professional Engineering

Chirality AI treats professional engineering as a **regulated, high‑stakes discipline** where the primary obligations are **public safety, legal/regulatory compliance, and ethical practice**. In this context, AI is not a substitute for engineering judgement; it is a **controlled tool inside an engineered system**.

We use agentic workflows to improve clarity, traceability, and execution quality, but we do so with a conservative architecture:

* **Agency is a system property, not a model capability.** We design closed‑loop workflows over time with explicit state, controlled actions, verification, and recovery.
* **Cognitive boundaries come first.** We pre‑structure what can be validated (schemas, registers, deterministic transforms, checklists) and reserve agent cognition for genuine uncertainty, interpretation, reconciliation, and tradeoffs.
* **Accountability remains human.** High‑stakes outputs require human review and approval by an accountable professional role (Engineer‑of‑Record or equivalent). No agent may claim to certify, sign, seal, or approve work for reliance.
* **Evidence over plausibility.** Outputs must be defensible: assumptions are labeled, conflicts are surfaced, unknowns remain unknown, and claims are tied to sources and verification methods.
* **Deliverables are the system of record.** The filesystem holds authoritative state; agents operate within bounded scopes and write permissions, producing auditable artifacts and decision-ready summaries.

Chirality AI’s intent is to bring agentic AI **inside professional engineering**, as disciplined architecture and governance—supporting competent practice, not replacing it.
