• Chirality AI Position on Professional Engineering

  Chirality AI treats “agentic AI” as an engineering discipline: agentic behavior is a
  system property (state, control, tools, and environment), not a claim about a model. We
  design cognitive boundaries first: structure what can be structured, reserve agent
  cognition for real uncertainty, and keep actions typed, gated, and validated. We insist
  on evidence over persuasion: outputs should be diffable, attributable, and reviewable,
  with provenance and explicit uncertainty. We assume failure over time, so monitoring,
  verification, and recovery are part of the architecture, not add-ons. Humans remain
  accountable at decision points; the system accelerates work without pretending to replace
  professional responsibility. We prioritize least privilege, data minimization, and
  transparent releases so agent operating instructions evolve like any other software:
  versioned, auditable, and trustworthy.
