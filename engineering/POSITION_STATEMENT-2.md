Based on the philosophy outlined in your `README.md`, `WHAT-IS-AN-AGENT.md`, and the newly drafted `PROFESSIONAL_ENGINEERING.md`, here is the position statement for Chirality AI.

# The Chirality Position: Engineering in the Age of Artificial Agency

**Engineering is not the art of building things; it is the art of building things that do not fall down.**

In the regulated, high-stakes world of professional engineering, "move fast and break things" is not a strategy; it is negligence. Chirality AI rejects the current industry trend of treating Artificial Intelligence as a magic box or a creative partner. Instead, we view AI as a powerful but strictly bounded **cognitive substrate**—a new material that must be engineered into a reliable system.

Our approach is defined by four non-negotiable principles:

### 1. Agency is a Control System, Not a Personality

We do not build "digital colleagues." We build **deterministic agentic workflows**.
An agent is defined by its ability to maintain control, coordination, and goals over time. We treat Large Language Models (LLMs) as a cost-effective component for handling the **combinatorics** of engineering—sorting, checking, extracting, and formatting—while reserving the **semantics** (meaning, intent, and safety) for the human engineer.

### 2. The Filesystem is the Only Truth

In professional practice, state is liability. If a project’s history exists only in a chat log or an opaque vector database, it is professionally irresponsible.
We enforce a **"Filesystem as State"** architecture.

* **Auditability:** Every decision, draft, and change is captured in plain files and tracked by Git.
* **Longevity:** Our project state survives the tool that created it.
* **No Hidden Memory:** If it isn't in the folder, the agent doesn't know it. This eliminates "gaslighting" and drift.

### 3. The Engineer is the Architect and the Gatekeeper

We reject the complacent "human-in-the-loop" model. We practice **"Human-at-the-Gate."**

* **Type 0 (Architect):** The human defines the standards, the decomposition, and the "physics" of the project.
* **Type 1 (Manager):** The system orchestrates the flow of work.
* **Type 2 (Specialist):** The AI executes bounded, stateless tasks.
The AI does not "issue" work. It submits drafts to a gate. Only a human Professional Engineer can open that gate to semantic validity and issuance.

### 4. Rigor Over Magic

We prioritize correctness over creativity.

* **No Silent Invention:** Our agents are explicitly instructed to output `TBD` rather than guess. A gap in data is an engineering fact; a hallucinated value is a lie.
* **Provenance:** Every assertion must cite its source. "Trust me" is not an engineering concept.
* **Traceability:** From the initial **Project Decomposition** to the final deliverable, every artifact has a stable ID and a traceable lineage.

**We do not automate engineering judgment. We engineer a harness that allows judgment to scale.**
