# Chirality Position Statement: Engineering in the Age of Artificial Agency

**"Move fast and break things" is not a strategy; in our line of work, it is negligence.**

The current technology narrative treats AI as a magic box—a "digital colleague" that will automate away the drudgery of work. Chirality AI rejects this personification. In the regulated, high-stakes world of Professional Engineering, AI is not a colleague. It is a **cognitive engine** that must be bolted into a chassis of rigorous control.

Our position is simple: **Agency is an Engineering Discipline.**

### 1. We Build Systems, Not Chatbots
An LLM is to an Agent what a combustion engine is to a car: essential, powerful, but useless (and dangerous) without a steering mechanism, brakes, and a transmission. We build the chassis. We design **closed-loop workflows** where state is explicit, actions are bounded, and recovery is deterministic.

### 2. Evidence Over Plausibility
Generative AI optimizes for *plausibility*—making things sound right. Professional Engineering optimizes for *truth*—making things stand up.
* We force our agents to cite their work.
* We force our agents to admit ignorance (`TBD`).
* We value a messy, accurate truth over a polished, plausible lie.

### 3. The Human Retains the Rights (and the Risk)
We are clear-eyed about liability. If a bridge falls, the LLM provider will not go to jail. The Engineer of Record will.
Therefore, the Engineer must retain total authority. Our systems are designed to **serve the decision-maker**, not replace them. Agents draft, sort, check, and propose. Humans decide, sign, and seal.

### 4. Rigor is the Only Way Forward
The future of engineering is not about "pushing a button" to get a design. It is about managing the complexity of modern infrastructure with tools that match the scale of the problem.
We believe that by constraining AI with the rigorous standards of professional practice, we don't limit its power—we unlock its utility for the real world.
