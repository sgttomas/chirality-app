# Chirality AI Position Statement on Professional Engineering

Chirality AI is built for **regulated, high-stakes engineering work** where outcomes can affect life, environment, critical infrastructure, and public trust. In this context:

- **AI is not a novelty; "agentic" is not an excuse.** What matters is **professional practice**: competence, duty of care, traceability, verification, and accountable decision-making.
- **Agentic AI is a system-level engineering discipline**, not a model feature. We design **cognitive boundaries** first: structure what can be structured, reserve agent cognition for real uncertainty, and keep actions typed, gated, and validated.
- **We insist on evidence over persuasion**: outputs should be diffable, attributable, and reviewable, with clear lines of accountability.

## Our Commitment

- **Safety and Compliance**: Non-negotiable adherence to legal, ethical, and regulatory standards.
- **Transparency and Reviewability**: All AI-driven outputs must be traceable, verifiable, and open to professional review.
- **Augmentation, Not Replacement**: AI is a tool to **enhance** professional judgement, not replace it.

**Core Principle:**
> "In professional engineering, tools assist. Tools cannot hold responsibility."
