# Professional Engineering in the Age of AI

Professional engineering is a **regulated, high-stakes discipline** where outcomes can affect life, safety, the environment, and property. In this context, **accountability is personal and non-transferable**, and professional judgement is central.

## Agentic AI as a System Property

"Agentic" is not a property of a model but of a **system** (state + control + tools + environment). Agentic AI is an **engineering discipline**, not a novelty or excuse for lack of rigor. It must be designed with **cognitive boundaries**: structure what can be structured, reserve AI for real uncertainty, and keep actions typed, gated, and validated.

## AI as a Controlled Tool

AI is a **tool within an engineered system**, not a replacement for professional judgement. Its use must prioritize:
- **Traceability**: Outputs must be diffable, attributable, and reviewable.
- **Verification**: Evidence over persuasion.
- **Safety and Compliance**: Non-negotiable adherence to legal, ethical, and regulatory standards.

## Path Forward

The integration of AI should **enhance decision-making, automate complex tasks, and improve coordination** in regulated environments. **Control and coordination** are emphasized over unchecked automation. The focus must remain on **safety, accountability, and public trust**.
