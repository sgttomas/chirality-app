# Ask Engineering Questions

This project contains instructions to do traditional engineering work and receive back answers with an explanation and a procedure you can follow to check the results.

Intended for engineers who work with ASME, API, ISA, IEEE, ASHRAE, CSA type of codes.

## How does it work?

The docs/ folder contains a "SKILLS.md" compatible file (engineering-protocol.md) for use with Claude Code.

 It also contains a UNIFIED.md file to be pasted as custom instructions in Claude Cowork.
 Choose which of those two agent work surfaces you prefer and then:


Start by giving Claude a task or asking it a question related to your engineering work.  

Respond to the prompts you are given in return.

Follow the Q&A and Claude will generate an answer and a set of instructions to follow so you can verify and evaluate the answer that you were given.

## Add context and references

If you are able, directly provide the reference materials and documents that have all the information that CLaude will need.

Let Claude find the correct information from those files.

## Take responsibility for your work

Engineers should learn to use AI in their work, but must take responsibility for the output.

These instructions help by giving you the procedure and guidance to quickly check outputs for yourself.

Never use LLM outputs without validating the results!
