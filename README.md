# Chirality AI App

A Next.js application that transforms complex problems into structured solutions through three-pass semantic document generation, enhanced by RAG chat and matrix-driven orchestration.

## What It Does

**Chirality AI** generates coherent, cross-referenced documents through a systematic three-pass refinement process:

1. **Matrix Integration**: Leverages semantic matrices from chirality-framework as "seeds of thought"
2. **Document Generation**: Creates DS/SP/X/M documents through V1â†’V2â†’V3 iterative refinement  
3. **RAG Enhancement**: Uses generated documents as evidence for intelligent chat responses

### Core Document Types
- **DS** (Data Sheet) - Data specifications, fields, types, validation rules
- **SP** (Standard Procedure) - Step-by-step implementation workflows
- **X** (Solution Template) - Integrated solution frameworks with verification criteria
- **M** (Guidance) - Strategic recommendations, risk analysis, best practices

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key
- Optional: Neo4j for graph features

### Installation
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your OpenAI API key
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3001 to start generating documents and chatting.

## How It Works

### Three-Pass Orchestration
1. **V1**: Matrix-seeded deterministic scaffolds â†’ AI enhancement
2. **V2**: Cross-referential refinement using insights from other documents  
3. **V3**: Final convergence with full context integration

### Matrix-Driven Generation
External matrices (from chirality-framework) serve as structured "seeds of thought":
- **C matrix** â†’ DS documents (requirements â†’ data specifications)
- **D matrix** â†’ SP documents (objectives â†’ procedures) 
- **X+E matrices** â†’ X documents (verification + evaluation â†’ solutions)
- **E matrix** â†’ M documents (evaluation â†’ guidance)

### RAG Chat Integration
Generated documents become "seeds of evidence" for intelligent conversations:
- Automatic context injection from your generated documents
- Grounded responses with citation support
- Maintains conversation coherence across sessions

## Usage Examples

### Document Generation
```bash
# Navigate to /chirality-core
# Enter: "implement user authentication system"  
# Choose: "ðŸ”„ Three-Pass with Matrix Integration"
# Result: Structured DS/SP/X/M documents with cross-references
```

### Enhanced Chat
```bash
# After generating documents, use chat:
# Ask: "How should I handle password reset flows?"
# AI response: References your generated DS/SP documents automatically
```

### Matrix Integration
```bash
# External matrix processing:
POST /api/agent/run
{ "framework_run_id": "sample_001", "enable_rag": true }
# Uses chirality-framework matrices as generation seeds
```
